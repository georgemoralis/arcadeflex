Tips and Tricks:


In the ramp section, levels 8,
9, and 10: holding down the
kick and jump buttons
simultaneously on the lip of
the ramp will boost your air.
This trick only works when
you're going the correct
speed (usually your third or
fourth jump), and only once
per ramp session per level.

1942 was the first game
Okamoto designed at Capcom.
He went on to do Gunsmoke,
Sonson and many others.


Tips and Tricks:


On certain levels, a
V-formation of red planes will
come straight down from the
top. If you kill all 5 of
them, and it turns into a
Black/Red POW, pick it up -
it's a free airplane! 


On levels where you pick up
the extra two airplanes next
to you: Use them to kill off
the bigger planes. You will
get a second chance to get
them back later on.


On the challenge levels, you
can get large bonuses based
upon shot accuracy:


Percent/Bonus


90%-94%---10,000
95%-99%---20,000
100%---100,000


On the levels with the huge
boss plane, save all your
loops! Shoot at it quickly,
loop down to avoid the shots,
and shoot at it again, and
then loop. You should be able
to kill it this way.


Most of the time it is easier
to keep only one wingman
rather than both; that way
it's easier to maneuver
around enemies. If you miss
the red airplanes that give
you the wingman, kill off
your man (assuming you have
more) and the game will place
you back before them.


At times, a slow airplane will
come out of the left or right
hand side of the screen. Shoot
it, and it will turn into a
special figure. If you fly
over the figure you will get
5,000 points! 


Here's an interesting bug in
1942: If you win an extra man
by crossing the xxx points
mark when killing the "boss"
bomber, no extra planes will
be awarded on the basis of
points! Extra planes can still
be obtained by getting the
black-and-red POW, but no
point-based bonuses will be
awarded for the rest of the
game.


It is possible to finish the
game. When completed, a
screen appears with a message
saying "We give up!", and a
10,000,000 point bonus is
awarded.

Tips and Tricks:


Here's a way to get
ridiculously high scores in
Alpine Ski:


1.Go thru the downhill section
with the points flags very
slowly and avoid collecting
positive points.


2.There's some point in the
course (should be easy to
find) where there's a negative
points flag near trees that
can be crashed into. This
trick is best done here.


3.Collect negative points to
roll your score back under
zero. You will be granted
massive time on the massive
points you have. Unfortunately
time will be taken off at an
incredible rate.


4.Run over the negative points
flag as necessary to get rid
of the points you win just by
moving forward and crashing
into the nearby trees.


5.Repeat Step 4 until you've
run out of time. You now have
a completely unbeatable high-
score and people will beg you
to tell them how you did it
( If it was 1982! ).



WARNING: ABSOLUTELY,
POSITIVELY DON'T GO BACK
ACROSS ZERO OR YOUR GAME WILL
END *IMMEDIATELY*!!! '

Tips and Tricks:


The power pills are not quite
random. There are essentially
two types of games. One has
lots of light blue multi-ball
pills and the pink warp pills
- this is a low scoring game.
The high scoring game gives
you more of the other pills.

Every pill is worth 1000
points. For the first few
levels, get every pill you can
but do not use the special
powers. You will get a lot of
extra ships and should get a
gray P (extra vaus) or two - 
hereby starting early with 6
or 7 ships.


In the mask end game, you
should get 15 hits(1000pts per
hit) on the mask/per man until
you eliminate the mask with
the 16th hit on your last man
to end the game.

Designed by Lyle Rains
Programmed by Ed Logg


Originally called Cosmos,
the original design was a
copy of Space Wars, except 
with asteroids littering the
playfield as an aesthetic
effect.  


Asteroids was the first game 
to have a top ten high score
field.


Due to a "watchdog reset"
built into the program you
can only get so many lives
before it will restart your
game.


There was a modified
version of Asteroids that was
given the nick-name 
"Turtleroids", it was part of
a long series of practical
jokes against the vice-
president of marketing for
Atari that was sick of a
game concept called Turtle
Races. One day Ed switched
the PROMs of the golden
edition of Asteroids in the
lobby of Atari so that the
little
and big UFOs were replaced
by turtles, thus providing
them with a constant
reminder. Another practical
joke involving Asteroids was
a slight modification in the
prototype of the game,
because Owen Rubin (initials
ORR on most Atari high
score tables) kept filling up
the high score tables when
the programmers were not
around. So, they modified the
program to replace Owen's
initials with Ed's own to keep
him away. 


Tips and Tricks:


The classic strategy for
Asteroids high scores involves
saving one or two slow-moving
(and highly vertical) rocks,
and then waiting in a corner
of the screen while killing
the 1000-point small saucers
with wrap-around shots. To
employ this strategy: sit
about one inch from the left
(or right) edge of the screen,
and about three inches from
the top (or bottom). If the
saucer appears close to you,
quickly turn and hit it with a
quick burst before it can
move. If you can't get it,
QUICKLY move to the opposite
side of the screen, aim toward
the screen's edge, and kill it
with the wrap-around shots.
This becomes quite easy with
practice. ALWAYS stay on the
opposite edge of the screen
from the little saucer after
it starts firing!


This strategy depends on the
fact that the little saucer in
Asteroids is incapable of
aiming and firing wrap-around
shots at the player. This is
NOT! true, however, in
Asteroids Deluxe...


The Winner's Book of Video
Games reported that some
players had good success
hunting small saucers by
moving to the middle of the
screen and thrusting upwards
at full speed. Supposedly the
saucers can't track a ship
moving at full speed, and can
be easily killed this way.
Here's a report on this method
from Alan Wootson:


"I used to always play the
'fly up the middle of the
screen' method. It's not true
that the little ships cannot
track you if you are flying
fast. After the first few
levels they get good enough to
blast you if you fly in the
same direction and at a
constant speed. If you use
this strategy you have to vary
your speed (making slight
changes to your direction
doesn't hurt either). You can
actually get pretty good at
weaving around several rocks
while hunting ships. It's also
a lot more fun that just
sitting in a corner."


Asteroids keeps track of up to
255 extra men. If you have too
many, the game may slow down,
probably due to the processor
having to draw all the extra 
en on the screen. However, on
an emulator on a fast computer
(Pentium 166+.) this may not
be a problem.


The maximum number of bonus
ships that can be displayed
across the top of the screen
is 56.


On some ROM versions, it may 
be possible to "hide" behind
the high-score display.


In a monumental display of
overconfidence on the part of
the Atari programmers,
Asteroids rolls over at only
99,999 points. Several players
during days-long marathon
games have scored over
100,000,000...

Original design by Ed Logg & 
Lyle Rains-Programmed by
Dave Shepperd


This game was created out of
modified Asteroids code.  At
the same time this game was 
being produced,  Space Duel 
was in the works,  but was 
shelved as Asteroids Deluxe
was green-lighted for 
production. This game did
poorly,  and Atari later 
released Space Duel to 
moderate success.  


Tips and Tricks:


When the Killsat ("snowflake")
ship comes out near the end of
the level, DO NOT attack it
head-on. Shoot at it, turn
around, get further away, and
then turn back towards it and
keep firing. This way you are
moving backwards, but you keep
firing at it.


Your shields have a maximum
life expectancy of 17 seconds.
Each collision with a rock
takes away about six seconds
of shield time. Once your
shield runs down, it can not
be recharged. In other words:
use your shields as little as
possible.


In the original Asteroids game
the large UFO shot in a random
direction. In Deluxe, it
shoots at rocks 75 percent of
the time and in the general
direction of your ship 25
percent of the time. If no
rocks are nearby, all shots go
towards your ship. This
renders the "save and hunt"
strategy from original
Asteroids useless.


The small UFO can now shoot
aimed wrap-around shots, and
at the 60,000 point mark, both
UFOs shoot with greatly
improved accuracy. 


Some advanced players hunt
Killsats in Asteroids Deluxe
as they hunted small UFOs in
the original Asteroids.

While popular history seems to
think that Data East designed
the game (because the pinout
matches Data East pinouts) the
internals of the two 6809
processors appear to be a
little
more complicated then that.
The game was released through
Romstar as a Tecmo game
licensed from Taito. This was
a
common practice with games
that apparently were deemed
to be "second tier" and were
not considered to be released
in the United States as "hit"

Designed by Morgan Hoff and 
Ed Rotberg-Programmed by Ed
Rotberg and Jed Margolin


Battlezone was the first 
environmental 3D landscape
game. The game used a system
of bit-slice processors 
called a "mathbox" to do 3D 
calculations for the display.
This kind of "squeezing the 
most out of minimal hardware"
mindset was what led Atari to 
create the innovative games
it did in the 1980's. Atari
has sold approximately 75,000
units. 


Battlezone was so innovative 
for its time,  the US Army
commissioned Atari to create
a version of the game for
infantry vehicle training.  
Ed Rotberg was assigned the 
project, but was very opposed
to it. Major Dave Robinson and
General Donn Starry of the
U.S.
Army were responsible for
bringing Atari the idea of
making a military version
to be used in training.


It is questionable whether the
US Army versions were ever 
produced,  but it is rumored 
that Videotopia (the traveling
video games exhibit) has one 
in their possession.


The volcano erupting in the
background was created by
Owen Rubin (Major Havoc).
Rubin pestered Rotberg to
add the volcano, but he was
too busy to write the code,
and told Rubin that if he
wanted the erupting volcano,
he'd have to write the code.
The next morning, Rotberg
walked in to a volcano
erupting onscreen and the
code listing on his desk.


The radar and warning messages
were "colorized" by red
cellophane placed atop the
screen.


Tips and Tricks:


Killing tanks:


Enemy tanks have the same
firing limitation that you do-
the shot has to disappear out
of range or hit something
before they can fire again.
This is the key - keep them
missing you and nail them
before they can reload. Never
sit still.

You need to get the enemy tank
in front of you (obviously).
The best bet is to just back
up until the tank is in your
cone of vision. Back up
straight and listen for it to
shoot at you. When you see the
shot pass, briefly turn
towards the tank, then resume
backing up straight. Repeat
this until the tank is
visible.
It won't be able to zero in on
you if you keep moving.

If you hit a barricade while
backing up, you have to react
quickly to avoid getting shot.
Move forward, then turn
slightly and then keep backing
up. If you're near the pyramid
next to the short cube, you 
may get hung up between them.
It's a good idea to know where
they are and avoid them.

Once the tank is in front of
you, if it's not facing you,
just zero in on it and kill
it.
If it is facing you (and
coming at you) you may be able
to get a barricade in-between
it and you. If you can, it
will run into it, then turn to 
avoid it. You can then nail it
once it moves away from the
barricade.

If you can't get a shot at a
tank's side, check the next
section for tips on killing it
head-on.


Regular tanks:


Drive towards it at an angle
(never directly head-on). It
won't be able to zero in on
you. You may have to keep
adjusting your course slightly
as you go. Drive even with or
slightly past it, pause a
second, then back up, turn
towards it and fire.

What happens is: as you pass
the tank, it will turn towards
you to zero in, but you're
moving faster than it can
turn. If you do it right, as
you back up, it will fire at
you and miss, giving you
enough time to aim.


Supertanks:


Follow the same directions as
for killing regular tanks,
except don't pause when you
pull side-by-side with it -
immediately back up, turn and
kill it. You may actually hit
the tank, but that's fine. It
will shoot at you and miss,
giving you time to blow it
away. Once you master the
timing of this, tanks are a
breeze.


Missiles:


Missiles are tricky to get the
hang of. The first one comes
at you straight, so you can
just back up in a straight
line to kill it.  The second
one (or two) will straighten
out near the end of their
attack so you can do the same
to them. After that, you have
to get the hang of their
flight pattern.

As soon as you hear the
missile coming, start backing
up and turn your tank so the
missile will come down just to
the left of the center of the
screen (use the crosshairs as
a guide), then back your tank
up in a straight line. The
missile will zig-zag on the
way down, then go straight, go
slightly left, then turn
sharply right. Watch for that
straight part of its flight,
wait for the left turn, then
when it turns to the right -
fire. The missile will fly
right into your shot. If you
position your tank correctly
when the missile comes down,
you don't need to do any more
turning.

If you miss, you may be able
to dodge the missile by moving
ahead and to the right, or if
you started backing up soon
enough, you may get off a
second shot (it will repeat
the straight, left, right
pattern if given enough room,
allowing you to shoot using
the same method).

This takes a bit of practice,
but once you get into the
rhythm, you can kill off
missiles to your heart's
content.


Saucers:


Don't go after saucers unless 
you know exactly where the 
enemy tank is, and can do so 
safely. If the enemy tank gets
in directly behind you, then 
don't chase a saucer down - 
the tank will shoot you in the
back. During a missile attack,
concentrate on the missiles - 
don't worry about the saucer 
until you're back to fighting 
tanks.

You can lurk (or hunt) for 
saucers, (sort of like in 
Asteroids). You need to get 
behind a tall barricade (the 
one shaped like a refrigerator 
works best). When a missile 
attacks, get right up to the 
barricade - then the saucer 
will jump over the barricade 
and you. As soon as it's 
overhead, spin the tank in 
place to the right. If you 
time it right, the missile 
won't be able to exit the 
radar screen and will be stuck
behind you as long as you're
spinning. Now you just keep
spinning until a saucer 
happens by. If you stop to 
shoot it, the missile will
escape, so try to shoot it on
the fly. Eventually the 
missile will escape on its own
although you can delay it by
backing up while spinning to
keep it in range.


Miscellaneous:


Free tanks are awarded at 
15,000 and 100,000, missiles
arrive around 15,000 and
Supertanks show up after 
20,000 (not including points 
earned from saucers). This 
changes depending on how a 
machine is set up. 
Battlezone's score probably 
wraps over at 10,000,000. Some 
time after 600,000 the 
Supertanks are replaced by the 
slower (lower scoring) regular 
tanks. This is a plus though, 
since it's safer to go after 
saucers.

Between attacks, drive forward
into an open area, so you have
a clear space to back into
during the next attack. During
missile attacks, you'll 
usually have to turn to the 
right to position the missile 
correctly.

Keep an eye on the radar 
screen when a new tank attacks
especially later in the 
Supertank rounds. If it puts 
one directly behind you, you 
have very little time to get 
away. Turn while driving away 
from it fast. Once you get 
clear, then you can back up 
and get it in front of you.

Practice shooting while 
turning. You can either 
practice on tanks (risky) or 
on barricades between attacks.

until it was discovered that
the processor didn't work 
properly.  The board was then
redone to run on a Z80.  The
speech was done using LPC
coding, which cost $1,000 per
word to compress at that time.
The game also originally had a
monochrome monitor; when
Defender was released in 
color, the company
re-considered their display
approach and re-designed the
display using a color overlay
board.


Evil Otto was named for Dave 
Otto,  who worked for Dave
Nutting's Arcade Engineering
group as R & D director at
the time Alan McNeil did. 
Each Berzerk unit was
"autographed" by the designer.


Mr. Peter Bukowski was the
first person to die playing a
video game, when he died of
a heart attack playing Berzerk
at the "Friar Tuck Game Room"
in Calumet City, Illinois. 


Tips and Tricks:


Always exit the mazes on the 
sides. If you exit the top or 
bottom, you will often start 
in a long corridor with many 
robots on both sides of you. 
During the fast rounds (past 
8000 points), you will not 
have a chance.


The robots will always move 
toward you. Use this to your
benefit when two (or more) 
robots are close to each other 
by moving your man back and 
forth, thus causing the robots 
to collide and annihilate each 
other.

When separated from the robots
by a vertical wall, move up 
and down to place the robots 
on the same horizontal plane, 
where they will kill each 
other with shots aimed in your 
direction.

The robots always walk toward 
you unless you're in their 
line of fire; then they will 
pause to shoot. There are 
eight directions you and they 
can shoot. The only way to 
survive the higher levels 
(10,000 points +) is to learn 
the blind spots of the robots. 
If you are in a robot's blind 
spot he poses no threat, and 
you can concentrate on 
blasting the others. The angle 
shots are almost never 
necessary. It is very 
difficult to hit a robot with 
an angle shot. When you shoot, 
your man stops moving, when 
you can't move, you are 
vulnerable. Make your shots 
count and don't bother wasting 
your time with angles unless 
you are on an early level and 
need the practice.


Because the robots are shorter 
than you, try to avoid robots 
at the bottom edge of the 
screen. By the time you move 
low enough to get a shot they 
will have already fired. In 
contrast, if you come "up" on 
robots from the bottom, you 
can shoot their feet and duck 
back down before their shot 
reaches you.


Because your man is a lot 
taller than he is wide, it is 
very easy to avoid shots from 
above and below. Take out the 
robots to the sides of you
first.


If you poke your head above a 
wall just far enough to shoot 
above it, the robots on the 
other side of it can't shoot 
you. They will only hit the 
wall. ALWAYS use this tactic 
to kill most of the robots in 
a maze. When you are in the 
right position, just hold down 
the fire button. This will 
make your player stand still. 
You can inch your way very 
close to the deadly walls 
without fear of running into 
them.

When shooting up or down, that
trick doesn't work. If there 
is a wall between you and a 
robot above you, run to the 
right and start shooting up 
just past the wall. If you are
lucky, the robot will walk 
into your fire before he gets 
a shot off. By design, if a 
robot is above you, he will 
lock into position directly 
in-line with your shots, and 
you will shoot each other's 
bullets. In early rounds you 
can overpower a robot and 
outgun him, but later the 
robots can keep up with you 
and you will be in a deadlock. 
To defeat him, shoot up and 
immediately walk to the right 
and he will walk into your 
bullet.


Because the robots are 
attracted to you "as the crow 
flies", they will tend to 
clump together and smash into 
each other. The best way to 
kill robots is to stand safely 
behind a wall and let them 
shoot and smash each other. 
The ball (Evil Otto) will also 
kill them. You can ignore some 
robots in the maze and let 
Otto kill them for you. Otto 
follows your position like the 
robots, so as he comes across 
the screen, lead him up and 
down into any remaining robots 
before you exit.

The robots are programmed to 
avoid colliding into the sides 
of the deadly walls, but they 
can't detect the start or end 
of a wall. If a robot is below 
the end of a wall, you can 
move up and direct him into 
the wall end.


In later rounds, all or the 
real action takes place in the 
first two or three seconds of 
a round. If you survive the 
initial shots from the robots, 
you are as good as done with 
the maze. When a new maze 
comes on screen, you are very 
vulnerable. Often you are in 
the line of fire of five 
robots. As the new maze slides 
on-screen, you can see it 
before the robots appear. Use 
this time to decide which way 
to run. Assume that there will 
be a robot in each "room" or 
"nook". Shoot the robot right 
in front of you first, and 
then run toward his position. 
By running ahead, you will 
exit the line of fire of any 
robots above/below you and 
also the dreaded angle shots. 
Once you are out of their line 
of fire, you can re-enter 
their line of fire selectively 
and shoot them. Get to a safe 
barrier as soon as possible 
and wait for the robots to 
move into easy positions.


The more robots that are in a 
maze (up to 11), the more time
you have until Otto comes out. 
If the maze has only 1-3 
robots, don't waste time 
shooting them unless they 
stand between you and the 
exit.

At around 20,000 points, the 
robots stay light blue.

Starting at about 10,000 pts, 
Berzerk becomes largely a game
of luck. If you get an open
maze with a lot of robots,
there is not much you can do.

An interesting quirk: The 
space between your man's head 
and body is not technically 
part of your man, so that 
shots that pass through this 
area (your "neck") will not 
kill you. ’

The game features several
hidden bonuses. Some of them
are the classic Capcom bonuses
(the four pointed star, the
POW,
the little cow); some are
cameos
from other Capcom games (the
barrel from Higemaru, the
robot
hero from Side Arms, the
dragonfly and the bamboo shoot
from Son Son).


Tips and Tricks:


When you get to the end of a 
level, just before jumping up 
to the boss/dragon/etc. stand 
on the closest platform below 
and shoot skeletons until the 
time goes down to about 10 
seconds. Then jump up and kill 
the boss - only the final 
dragon takes any length of 
time. In other words, use all 
the time before leaving the 
level! If you do this early on 
in level 1, you are able to 
afford the second weapon at
the
first shop; this makes level 2 
considerably easier.

Also, this allows you to 
finish the game with a 
2 million + score. If you just
finish the level immediately 
you only get about 1.5Million.

At the end of the levels with
monsters - not dragons - just 
stand in front of them and 
press jump and fire, don't 
move, and they will not touch 
you.

Tips and Tricks:


An important piece of 
information to remember is 
that you can pick up the bombs 
in a certain order to get the 
maximum points.

If you pick up most of the 
bombs while their fuses are 
lit, you get the following 
bonuses:


..Bombs............Bonuses

...20..................10,000

...21..................20,000

...22..................30,000

...23..................50,000


So of course, you'll want to
try to get 23 each time. (This
is of course, VERY difficult!)

The P (Power) coin appears 
after every ninth bomb is 
collected. The points value of 
the P coin ranges from 100 
(Blue) to 2000 (Silver).
Since the color changes each 
time BJ jumps, you can control 
the bonus level by making 
small jumps until the coin 
turns silver.

The B (Bonus) coin appears 
every 5,000 points, and 
advances the bonus multiplier 
by 1. There is a maximum of 
5 B coins per level.

Picking up the S (Special) 
coin awards one free credit. 
It will also take you to the 
next level automatically.


You can control where the 
mechanical bird appears by 
holding the joystick in the 
opposite direction. Example: 
Hold the joystick to the right 
as soon as the round starts 
and the mechanical bird 
appears on the left of the 
screen. If the stick is held 
diagonally, the bird appears 
in the opposite corner.

Tips and Tricks:


Just as in Time Pilot, there
is a way you can stay on a 
level for as long as you want
(This works best on level 2).

Finish off the first level, 
and go to the second. Now, 
stay away from all the bases, 
and fly horizontally from left 
to right. Just fire 
continuously at all the 
formations that come at you. 
The other ships will never be 
able to come after you. There 
is no time limit in the game, 
and it never gets any harder. 
You can stay on this level for 
as long as you want. It takes 
a VERY LONG TIME, though, to 
get a large score.

#bublbobl

$info= bublbobl, bublbobr
$icon=bubbles
$data
$bio
Tips and Tricks:


When the game is displaying 
the "BUBBLE BOBBLE" screen in 
attract mode, try the 
following sequence of 
joystick/button commands:

Left, Jump, Left, 1P, Left, 
Fire, Left, 1P.

It'll say "POWER UP!" at the 
bottom of the screen. The next
game you play, you'll have all 
the useful powers (speed, fast 
bubbles, multiple bubbles).

Then there's the ORIGINAL GAME 
cheat mode. This one gives you 
all the magic doors (even if 
you die. You will *not* get 
them if you die on non-OG 
mode): Fire, Jump, Fire, Jump,
Fire, Jump, Right, 1P.

Both cheats can be done during 
the one game. In fact, you 
don't even have to use these 
secret control sequences on 
the same title screen.


After getting a high score, 
enter your initials as S.E.X. 
Start the next game as normal. 
The second item on the first 
level will be a pitchfork. 
Getting this item without 
bubbling the bad guys will get 
you mucho points.

Make it to level 20 without 
dying, and a door appears-- 
it leads to a 'secret tomb,' 
a level full of diamonds. 
There are secret tombs at 
levels 20 and 30, also.


Make it to level 50 without 
dying, and a strange, beehive-
shaped door appears; enter it 
and you warp to level 70. 
DON'T kill the drunks on level
50, or the door disappears; 
bubble them and wait! BTW, 
with two players, only one of 
the players must survive 
unharmed to get the secret 
door.


Special item: the bell. If 
taken, a flash and a 'bell' 
sound will go off at the 
beginning of any level that 
will have some sort of 
destructive magic.


"Paffing a Skel" : Skel is 
that nasty white monster that 
comes after you when you've 
taken too long; with two 
players, two Skels will 
appear. If one player is 
killed by 'his' Skel, then he 
can collide with his partner's 
Skel *WHILE HE IS STILL 
FLICKERING.* If the player's 
icon is still flickering, the 
other player's Skel will 
disappear (poof!), with no 
harm to the once-slain 
character.

*The Trick* : At the end of a 
level, sometimes all of the 
bubbles on the screen will 
inexplicably turn into food 
(even if there was no candy 
cane on that level). If the 
tens and hundreds digits of 
either player's score match 
when the last monster of a 
level is popped, then the 
bubbles will turn into food! 
Ex: scores of 10,770 1,350,990 
or 576,000 will produce 
'the trick.' Kill everything
in a 
level, and as one player moves 
to pop the last monster, the 
other player will 'get the 
trick' by blowing bubbles 
against a wall until the 
score is correct. Notice that 
you _do_ get the points for 
popping the last monster, so 
if you're by yourself, you 
have to work your score so 
that the tens and hundreds 
digits will match _after_ the 
points for the last monster 
are added....


*'Blowing yourself through'* : 
It is possible (though quite 
difficult) to bounce on a 
bubble at the top of the 
screen and ride it 'through' 
the top, so that you emerge at
the bottom of the screen.

The original Data East version
hardware had a cassette 
module so games could be
converted easily and quickly.
Unfortunately, the cassettes 
were prone to breakage, and
the systems were quickly
junked. When Bally Midway
licensed the game from DECO,
they replaced the hardware
with a dedicated hardware
system.


Tips and Tricks:


The levels repeat after every 
6 screens.

Enemies can't turn around 
immediately, so you can follow
them around temporarily.

The indicator that shows how 
many chefs you have remaining 
is broken, so keep a careful 
count for yourself. This is 
probably due to a bug in the 
original Burger Time ROMs.

The best tactic is generally 
to stand halfway across a 
piece of food, wait for 
enemies to appear on the 
food's edge, and then drop 
the food and enemies at once. 
Always lure the enemies onto 
the highest portion of the 
screen, and then drop them. 
This has several advantages: 
it clears more burger pieces, 
plus it means that units on 
lower levels may wander into 
the cascading pieces, killing 
them also.


Leave LOTS of room around 
yourself when going up
ladders. 
The sprites in Burger Time are
somewhat bigger than the 
visible characters.

When enemies first appear, you
have 1/4 sec to go through 
them, if you need to.

IMPORTANT : If you die while 
the last piece of food is 
falling into place, the game 
will NOT deduct a man from 
your game!


Here are some simple
strategies for starting the
levels:


Level 1: Go directly to the 
top

Level 2: Go directly to the 
top

Level 3: Go directly to the 
left, use pepper on the egg, 
and kill the pickle. Then go 
down and to the right

Level 4: Zigzag up to the 
top

Level 5: Go straight up to the 
first ledge, take the ladder 
up, and then go to the middle 
portion of the board

Level 6: Go to the upper left, 
work your way to the right 
side, and then go down


Here are some bonus point
values:

Ice cream cone (on levels 1 
and 4): 500

Cup of coffee (on levels 2 
and 5): 1000

French Fries (on levels 3 
and 6): 1500

#Capcom Bowling
$info=capbowl,capbowl2
$icon=capbowl
$data
$bio
Tips and Tricks:


These tips can be used to get 
a perfect score:

The biggest tip for Capcom/
Coors Light Bowling: PLAY WITH
THE KEYBOARD! It's a heckuva 
lot easier to get precise 
control of the ball with arrow 
keys than with a trackball. 
Play with the trackball only 
if you've mastered the game 
with the keyboard or if you 
want a true arcade experience.

To get a strike most of the 
time, position the ball 
between the 3rd and 4th dots 
behind the foul line. Also, 
move the ball closer to the 
foul line, but do NOT cross 
it. The closer you move the 
ball to the foul line, the 
more you may need to nudge
your ball a little to the 
left. This is because when the
ball travels slow enough on 
the lane, it will hook to the 
right.

If the ball is over the line 
when you position your ball, 
and you have not thrown it, 
you can move it back behind 
the line with no foul (which 
is necessary if over half of 
the ball is across the line...
a foul will be called if you 
try throwing it from that 
position)

"Cannonball was written on a
Model 33 teletype machine
connected to a Motorola
MicBug 6800 processor, both
which were connected to 
simple video game hardware.
I hand-assembled the entire
program... saving the program
on punched paper tape.


I recall my first review of
the game. My boss said "Can
we see listings?" "Listings,
what listings?" I replied. He
was astonished to learn that
I had not used the PDP-11
systems and the two computer
operators which sat in the 
other building who would type
in all your code, assemble,
and link the program and
return you a listing and a
paper tape. And so started
my Videogame career."

(Owen Rubin, in a Siggraph
article he wrote)


The following is from a
conversation between MAMEDEV's
Mike Balfour and Owen Rubin:

"Game play: a cannon would
appear on the left side of the
screen. The screen was turned
on edge if I recall so the
long
direction was up). A wall 
would appear on the right side
of the  screen with a hold
placed on one of three
positions (in an early version
3 holes would appear at the
same time). A man would
run out and stand next to the
cannon. The control panel had
two controls (both switches).
The first control was a handle
that when pulled back, would
close a switch that would make
a small powder keg appear
above the cannon and would
add powder to the cannon.
There was no visual indication
of the amount of powder, you
had to time this. You could
add
and stop as long as you liked.
When you let go of the handle
the man would jump into the
cannon. If you pulled it
again,
he would jump out. When you
thought you had enough
powder, you hit the fire
button.
The man would fly towards the
wall and one of 4 things could
happen. If too little powder,
he
would fly very short, hit the
ground, and while holding his
back, would limp off the
screen. If close, but not
correct
the man would hit the wall and
SPLAT (a sound I made out of
white noise by recording the
sound of wet paper towels
hitting the floor in a shower,
and recreating this in white 
noise). The flattened man (the
picture was a flat man with
legs sticking out) would slide
down the screen to the
bottom of the wall, and limp
off. Too much powder and
the man would fly over the
wall and after a short pause,
you would hear a large
crash. The correct amount
of powder and the man
flew through the hold,
the crowd would cheer,
and the man would come
running back to the cannon
with his arms raised in an
Evil Kenevil way. On this
miss case, the man would
walk to the cannon. Three
to 5 misses (maybe 6) and
the game was over. We
had an 8 track tape machine in
the cabinet and when the game
started, a relay would start
the
tape and circus music would
play. The entire game was 2K
including self test. Some of
the
management did not like the
idea of splatting the guy,
but I left it in anyway. 
I did Sky Diver right after
this game, and since they
didn't like the splat, I
originally had the person sky
diving over water and he
would splash into the water if
he missed or did not open in
time. Then the SAME
management came to me and
said "can we have the guy
splat
into the ground?" Sure, I
already had the sound. So if
you have seen Sky Diver...
the guy actually splats into
the
ground head first with his
feet
kicking in the air. Same
SPLAT. And this game got
produced too! :-)"

The first coin-op game
designed by a woman. A
grasshopper was in the
original design,  but was
later removed from the game.
Like Pacman,  this game has
special appeal to women.


According to this Usenet
posting, Dona Bailey didn't
have as much to do with 
Centipede as first thought:


"Actually, Ed Logg had a lot
more to do with Centipede than
Dona Bailey. In an anonymous
Atari designers words: "Dona
Bailey couldn't program her
way out of paper bag..."
Remember the famous 8-6-4
GM cadillac engine from
1980-81 that used to catch
fire??
Guess who designed this, and
used to work at GM before they
got 'fired', and ended up
working
at Atari? I feel it was smart
marketing by Ray Kassar and
Frank Ballouz to advertise the
game as being designed by a
woman, but I'd only give her a
very slight amount of partial
credit for the concept only
and
no code in Centipede....

FWIW, Millipede was designed
almost entirely by Ed...."


Centipede was the 1st UL 
(Underwriter's Laboratories)
approved game.


Tips and Tricks:


On levels that have complete 
centipedes (all in one piece), 
the fleas never come out. You 
can clear all the mushrooms on 
these levels. [Of course it's 
the easiest on the first
level!]

You can start building a 
shield of mushrooms on the 
lower levels, and that way you 
don't have to work about fleas 
dropping, or poisoned 
mushrooms either.

If you're really patient, 
build a shield around yourself
and just shoot spiders for the
whole game.


When you reach your last 
official extra man before 
1,000,000, every time you 
score and have less than 6 
men, you'll get an extra guy. 
This is a real pain, because 
this advances by 12,000 the 
amount of points you will have 
to get AFTER 1M to get your 
first guy after that point.

Important turning points 
(based on score):


60K - fleas speed up.
860K - spider goes back to 
12-row wipeout. This is a
pain...


Note that a very important 
factor in the game is the 
rate of feed of the new 
centipede segments when one 
reaches the bottom. You can 
manipulate this feed value, to 
get past the really impossible
feed!

First, the feed rate doesn't 
advance until the first time a 
centipede segment actually 
feeds in. Then it advances on 
a straight point basis. It 
seems to turn over every 300K 
or so. But the rate of feed 
increases much faster when 
you're scoring while centipede
segments are actually feeding
in.

Note that on millipede, feed 
is even more important, and 
you have to be very careful 
tuning your feed rate 
according to the level you 
expect to reach at the time 
your feed reaches impossible 
level. The 'fast feed' 
machines are actually easier 
in this respect (for the more 
advanced players).

So you think blood and guts in 
video games is a phenomenon of
the 90's? The main point of 
this game is to shoot helpless 
humans in the most gory manner 
possible. It is amazing

$data
$bio
Originally designed and 
programmed by Dan Gorlin for
the Apple II computer


Tips and Tricks:


In the early stages, try to 
fly as low as possible - this 
way the fighters will not 
shoot you, and you are low 
enough to shoot the ground
targets without being shot. 
Since this only works when 
you're in the air, and not 
when you're on the ground, it
only works well on levels 1 
and 3.


To ensure that the tank won't 
arrive when you're picking up 
hostages, barely tap the 
joystick up between each 
hostage. This will cause the 
helicopter to lift off a 
little and reset the timer 
that causes the tanks to 
arrive.


On level 2, you can land on 
the water under the boat when 
dropping off your men and they 
will climb up the side of the
boat. This stops the planes 
from coming down and shooting 
you.

Tips and Tricks:


This trick works on both sets 
of ROMs. On the first level 
when you are on a Lion and 
have to jump through burning 
hoops, jump backwards through 
a hoop and then forwards 
through it again. The next 
hoop to appear will then 
change into an extra life. 


Here's a small hidden bonus: 
On the first (flaming hoops) 
level, jump over the first 
flaming urn, then jump 
backwards over it. A bonus 
item should rise vertically 
from it; grab it and it's 
worth 2000 points. Ideally, 
you should time it so that 
jumping back over the urn 
coincides with the passage of 
a hoop over the urn.

Note: this is for the 'level 
select' version. On the 
original version, it seems to 
work on the second urn.

#commando

Tips and Tricks:


Here's a hot way to kill the
soldiers without going 
anywhere near them. At the 
end of each area, when the 
enemy soldiers are pouring 
out of the gate from their 
compound, move your commando 
to the bottom of the screen 
and shoot down. Your shots 
will come down from the top 
of the screen, killing the 
soldiers as they come out of 
the gate.


This will let you rack up big 
points and all the extra men 
you can:

This should work on all 
commando games that are set 
on regular factory difficulty. 
I don't think there was a chip
fix for this.

On the first stage there is a 
cliff on the right side of the 
screen. The bad guys will jump 
off the end of this cliff and 
attack you. If you walk until 
the bad guys START jumping off 
and then stop you can stand 
there and kill them until you 
get sick of playing or until 
you reach the max extra men. 

If you plan on playing thru
the rest of the game you 
should stop at the max amount 
of extra men. If you just sit 
there the enemies will get 
faster and faster so the rest 
of the game will be harder.

Tips and Tricks:


In the second building: when 
you arrive at the electrical 
sign, choose the left path. 
Then put yourself under the 
electrical wire (rightmost 
window of the left path) but 
keep both joysticks pressed. 
After a few seconds your 
climber will become red with 
white hair and electricity 
won't have effect on it.


There is a secret password in 
Crazy Climber. Enter the name 
"jordan.ltd" in the high score 
table and you get two free 
credits. This only works on 
the Japanese and bootleg 
versions of the game. 
(Although the password code 
is still present in the US

Tips and Tricks:


On the barrel level:


Climb up to the second beam 
(the one with the hammer right
by it). Walk to the right so 
that Mario is still facing 
away from you (you can see his
back) and is suspended off the
side of end of the beam, then 
jump to the right. He'll "fall 
thru" the bottom of the screen 
and clear it, as if he had 
climbed all the way to the 
top.


On the conveyor belt level:


Grab the bottom hammer (the 
one on the row with the full 
length conveyor belt) and go 
all the way to the right side 
of the screen. Push the 
joystick right and he'll drop 
the hammer. Sometimes it'll be 
in the up position and 
sometimes it'll be sitting 
toward the left of Mario. If 
it's in the up position, jump 
up and grab it and keep 
repeating until he drops it 
on the left position. After 
this, you can walk away and 
anything that comes into 
contact with it will be 
splatted.

After a few seconds, the 
hammer will disappear, but the 
stuff will still splat when it 
hits where the hammer should 
be.

NOTE: This trick only works on 
the second level or higher!

Originally called Toperoids,
this game was originally a 3D
Asteroids variant, in which
asteroids and other objects 
fell from the sky, endangering
the player.  The enemies
coming down from the top of
the screen was an artifact
from the original concept.
(Videotopia)


Tips and Tricks:


There's a 'continue option' 
warp on the first board. It 
won't take you any higher than 
level 8, though.

The first warp is behind the 
palace on the upper-right hand 
corner of the first board. Go 
there then jump. It'll take 
you to level 3.

The second warp: get the hat, 
run to an elevator, and at the 
back corner of the hidden 
ramp, jump before the hat 
expires. The warp always gives 
you four lives (not including 
the one you're on) and takes 
you to level 5.

The third warp is on the third 
screen of Level 5, titled 
"Crossroads." It is extremely 
easy to trigger; just move to 
the very upper left corner and 
jump. You will be transported 
to the first screen of Level 
7, again with four lives to 
spare.

There are no other warps.


The final level is 10-1 (THE 
END). If you finish this 
level, the screen fills up 
with various objects and a
message appears: "You win!
You must be a video hero."


A Trick : Jump 100 times or 
more in the front corner of 
the first maze. (It's best to 
trap the balls inside the maze 
somewhere.) It doesn't matter 
how many lives it takes you to 
jump this number of times. (It 
usually takes two full lives 
of constant jumping.) Clear 
the maze of gems and the name 
"ATARI" will appear in a 
banner across the screen at 
the beginning of level two.


On Level 5, Berthilda's Palace
grab the hat, and enter the
large door where Berthilda is.
Run over her for 3000 points,
then head to the corner of the
room (where Berthilda was) 
and jump. The initials FXL 
will appear in the lower-right 
hand corner of the screen, 
which stands for Franz 
Lanziger, one of the 
designers of Crystal
Castles!

#Darwin 4087

Tips and Tricks:


Here is some info on the 
powerups:

Pister, Beas ( Your starting
level ), Basum, Sharru, 
Miseave, Twipet, Dodok, Zugau,
Kues ****, Shasuem, Zugoga,
and Gasharro

Each time you get one of those
power-ups, you go up a level. 
Each time you get hit [or] 
after a short time, you drop
down a level. You start on 
Beas which allows you to get 
hit once without dying (kind,
aren't they?). You can never 
drop below Pister unless you 
get hit.

Now, if you power up to 
Sharru, allow it to drop down 
a level and then get another 
powerup, you reach Laysper. 
This is an evolutionary dead-
end. No amount of power ups 
will get you any further. 
You need to power down and 
power up again.

To get the *beefy* power ups,
go to Kues, and allow a power
down. You then go up this 
ladder: Measa, Malto, Seas,
and Deam (now we're cooking!)

Allow yourself to get hit when
you are Deam - You now become
Black Deam ( mega bat power )
!!!! Excellent !!!


There are plenty of other neat 
touches such as docking with 
some of the bosses. I know 
there was a horizontal stick 
alien which if you shot the 
right number of times drifts 
slowly down the screen. You 
can dock with this to get 
extra firepower.

This means the aliens that 
have extendible poles that 
spring out from their sides. 
Just shoot them until they 
flash, dock with them, and 
you'll get a particularly 
useful upgrade to your bombs.

You can also dock with the 
rectangular aliens ( after you 
have shot them a few times ). 
These appear close to the 
start of the game. It seems 
anything you shoot that then 
drifts slowly down, you can 
dock with (which increases 
the bomb power).


Did you notice the "bird" 
aliens that start at the 
bottom and flap their way up 
the screen ? Well guess what-
you can actually *mutate* with
these. Simply fly over the top 
of them and keep firing. You 
will then mutate into an "eye"
type creature that sprays 
bullets all over.

Designed and programmed by
Eugene Jarvis, Larry DeMar,
Sam Dicker, and Paul Dussault


The macho man's game!!
Defender was noted for its
sound and visual effects, and
extremely hard gameplay. That
didn't stop players from 
racking up millions of points
on the game.


Literally minutes from the
opening of the AMOA Jarvis
and his team were burning
new ROMs for the display game
due to the fact they plugged
the first burn into the board
backwards and fried them!
Due to the intimidating 
controls, no one played the 
game and were even rumors 
saying Pac Man and Defender
would bomb and Rally-X
would be the next hit.


Not only did Defender have the
most buttons to use during
gameplay (It had 5 buttons,
plus a joystick) but it was
also the first game to have
events occur outside of the
players main screen.


A bug in the scoring occurs at
990,000 points which allows
players to rake up enough
ships to take a much needed
bathroom break, because
everything you shoot after
this
point earns you an extra ship. 


Easter Egg: To see the
designers credits, do the
following while in game
play...
joystick down, reverse, 1
player start, thrust, reverse,
2 player start, fire, joystick
down, 1 player start, thrust,
and fire. 


Tips and Tricks:


There are reverse lines for 
swarmers and mutants
(sometimes 
called the "International Date 
Line"). If this line is 
between you and the type of 
enemy in question, they will 
travel the opposite direction 
around the planet to get you. 
(I.e. they won't cross this 
line to get to you.) If a 
mutant, say, is following you 
and you cross the mutant 
reverse line (to the left of 
the Big Mountain) it will 
suddenly reverse direction and 
go around the other way. The 
same is true for the swarmer 
reverse line (located 
approximately where your ship 
starts each wave). This 
doesn't affect swarmers that 
you are following behind. If 
you're on one side of the 
line and a pod is on the 
other and you shoot it open 
the swarmers will fly away 
from you and you can get in 
behind them immediately. The 
best use of these lines is 
where there are lots of 
swarmers and/or mutants that 
you don't want to hassle 
with. You stay near the line 
in question and go back and 
forth over it to keep the
enemy in question on the other 
side of the planet. Especially 
useful in space and waves that 
get really hairy.


You can freeze a Defender 
machine by picking up all ten 
humans (on any wave, but 
Wave 1 is your greatest chance 
at success), stopping all 
forward motion of your ship, 
quieting the screen down (i.e. 
having no enemies moving 
around on it) and setting all 
the humans straight down 
quickly. This seems to work 
better were the terrain is 
very close to the bottom of 
the screen. Every thing will 
freeze, but you can still move 
your ship up and down. 
Thrusting will break the 
spell, so to speak. If you do 
pick a spot with shallow 
terrain, some humans will go 
thru the bottom of the screen 
and appear suspended in mid-
air near the top. This trick 
is good during marathon games 
when you've reached Wave 256 
and need a breather.


Some top players begin each 
round by shooting their own 
men, except for one, which 
they pick up. This keeps 
mutants from developing, but 
it also means that the world 
explodes if you crash. It 
probably goes without saying 
that this can be considered 
an -advanced-  trick...


When you get your last 
official guy before 1,000,000, 
every time you score, you'll 
get an extra man.

The trick was to win 100+ 
ships between 990,000 and 
1,000,000, thus fooling the 
game based on where score 
rolls over rather than where 
ships roll over. The version 
where you win 100+ ships has 
been tested, the version 
where you win 256+ ships never 
was because:


a. For every point scored in 
Defender from 990,000 to 
999,975 you will win one extra 
ship and smart bomb.

b. If you suicide on 
something, including a shot 
but not including hyperspace 
(because dying from hyperspace 
awards no points), you will 
lose one ship, but also gain 
one (net effect on ships is 
zero) plus one smart bomb.

c. For winning n ships in 
Defender from 990,000 to 
999,975, including suicides, 
you will have to wait n x 
10,000 points after passing 
1M before the game's 
accounting balances and it 
awards ships properly at 
10,000 point intervals again.

d. The score returns to zero 
every 1 million, meaning that 
if you had won 100 ships the 
machine would have to wait 
1 million points to begin 
awarding ships again. However, 
since 1 million is equivalent 
to zero it awards them 
immediately at 1,010,000.

- or -

e. Being an 8-bit game, 255 
ships is the maximum 
recognized. 256 ships/smart 
bombs is treated as zero. If 
you win exactly 256 ships 
during this period the 
machine will think you have 
won none and thus begin 
awarding ships immediately at 
1,010,000. (This one has not 
been verified -- rb)

In either case, you get to 
keep your surplus ships and 
bombs and can have super long 
turns where you bomb 2 to 3 
times per wave to get out of 
dangerous situations.


Game Settings: These aren't 
tricks, but unlike the other 
Williams games, the settings 
are very cryptic (just 
numbers). The  game is hard 
enough on just defaults!

Dig Dug was the NOT the first
game that Atari licensed from
Namco Ltd.,  as is common
belief. That honor goes to
F-1,  the "3D" racing game
that projected a race track
on a screen using a rolling
film.(Brian Deuel)


The first video game
advertised in movie theaters
as a 142 second movie trailer
satire. It was put together by
Young and Rubicam over a 5
day shoot and featured that
talents of Jim Spencer from
the Poltergeist FX crew.


Tips and Tricks:


Dig Dug Bug: Get either a 
Pooka or Fygar right on your 
tail, then pump him up but not 
so much that he explodes. Do 
this right near a rock--be 
warned that this is rather 
tricky. The idea is to loosen 
the rock when the enemy is 
almost fully inflated, get out 
of the way, then do a quick 
reverse and finish off the 
enemy at exactly the same 
time as he is crushed by the 
rock (avoiding the rock 
yourself, of course). This 
will confuse the game and all 
enemies on the current level 
will disappear leaving you to 
aimlessly dig tunnels through 
the dirt. You will not 
progress to the next level 
until you drop another rock.


If you want to be extra greedy 
and get more points, eat all 
the dirt on the level. Leave 
only two enemies (because they 
will speed up, and three is 
too hard to handle). You don't 
need to eat every little bit 
of dirt (you can leave long 
passageways to slow down the 
enemies). Also leave only 
pookas, since the fygars can 
burn you through the dirt.


After level 12, the screens 
repeat in waves of 4. There 
are patterns for these levels. 
Also, after level 36, all the 
enemies will speed up. You 
will have to use new patterns 
for all the other levels 
again. The game gets
incrementally faster every
round, however at round 136
all the monsters freeze,
and starting with round 137
they start to move a bit
faster, although the game
never gets close to top
speed again.


This game does NOT give extra 
man after 880,000 (This depends
on the extra man setting).
The score will flip over at
1,000,000.


It is very easy to get a score 
of 999,990 by eating dirt for
ten points per section.


At round 256 the game will 
start with a pooka over your
head and you get killed off.
If you continue your game on
round 256 it will start over
at level 1 and get easy again.
The game will play as normal,
awarding extra men as if you
started on round 1.


Dig Dug is also mentioned in
Pole Position and Super
Sprint (in the first column
of high scores)

First multi-playfield game.
Was a quick replacement for
an excess stock of cabinets
for a poor game called 
Radarscope. Mario WAS given
his name in the original 
Donkey Kong game.(Some 
believe he wasn't named
Mario until DK Jr.).
In Donkey Kong, Mario's
career was a carpenter.


The Japanese and European
version of Donkey Kong have
the board in the logical order
1-2-3-4, while in the US 
version they changed it to 
1-4-1-3-4-1-2-3-4.

In the older versions of the 
game you can stay at the top 
of a ladder, and a barrel will 
never come down the ladder to 
hit you. They later changed it 
so that a barrel comes down 
most of the time.


Tips and Tricks:


There are a series of patterns
which work for Donkey Kong and 
Crazy Kong. They don't work 
all the time, but 90% is
pretty 
much better than nothing.

This one seems to work on 
nearly all of the 'rivets' 
levels. When you start, go up 
the ladder immediately to the 
left, turn right, and remove 
the rivet in front of you. 
Cross over to the nearest 
ladder to the right and go up 
it,  followed by removing the 
rivet immediately to the left, 
and go up the ladder to the 
left. Repeat this snakelike 
maneuver until you've removed 
all of the rivets on the left-
hand side of the screen.

Once you're on the top level, 
jump over the newly-formed gap 
to your right, grab the 
umbrella and climb down the 
ladder directly below you. 
When you're on the platform 
just under DK, run right and 
grab the hammer as soon as 
it's safe. Kill any fireballs 
in the immediate area, but the 
important thing to remember is 
that you must remove the rivet 
on the right. As soon as 
you've done that, stay on the 
little island on the right 
you've created, killing any 
fireballs that wander into 
range from any direction; 
you'll be relatively safe as 
any 'resurrected' fireballs 
will appear on the left-hand 
side of the screen.

When the hammer runs out, 
climb up the ladder on the 
right-hand side and remove the 
rivet on the top level
(immediately to DK's right). 
Climb down, and go after the 
two remaining rivets as and 
when it's safe.

This may be a bug or it may 
just be a special part of the 
game. If you finish ANY round 
with the last three numbers in 
the time left are at 300 (it 
may have been 400 or 500) it 
will give you an extra 100,000 
points. Just sit there until 
the timer is at the right 
number then finish. (NOTE: 
This tip is reportedly for a 
DK clone called "Donkey King", 
-not- the real DK... --RB)

On the rivet levels (where DK 
falls) if you make it to the 
top level along w/ DK himself 
and position yourself very 
near but not touching.. You 
will get 100 points for each 
time you jump in the air. 
Doesn't add up too quickly but 
it's fun to do... possibly the 
first 'taunt' move in video 
games. 

Also on the rivet levels: If 
you find yourself hemmed in by 
fireballs at the edge of the 
screen, a good last-resort 
move is to jump off the edge 
of the level. Mario will 
"bounce back" to the level 
after a short delay, during 
which the fireball may have 
moved somewhere else.

This trick works only with the 
Japanese version of DK: On the 
"barrel" levels, you can stay 
on a ladder without worrying 
about the barrels coming down 
and hitting you. Just make 
sure that Mario's hand is 
touching the top of the girder 
(so that it looks like the 
barrels are rolling over his 
hand). As long as you're in 
this position, no barrel will 
ever come down your ladder.

At advanced levels, the girder 
screen gets harder and harder 
with girders bouncing faster. 
A trick that will make these 
girder screens easier:

1) Get as close to the 
bouncing girder as possible. 
(Experiment to find the right 
position for Mario)

2) Notice when Mario's 
girlfriend says "HELP!" and 
count the girders going by. 
After *four* girders have 
gone by, head for the ladder. 
If you time it right, you will 
make it up the ladder.
(This is not a reliable
method according to expert
players - Mark)

The sequel to Donkey Kong,
and the second in the never-
ending Mario cannon. This
game, although better than
its predecessor, never got
higher than number 3 on the 
Replay chart.


Tips and Tricks:


This will let you play 
forever. Start the game with 
both players. Play your first 
player just like normal. Then 
when you die and you are on 
the second player you will 
have to move DkJr all the way 
to the right at far as you can 
go. You will be hanging off 
the ledge almost all the way. 
Then you have to wait for one 
of the traps to go down the 
rope that is above you and to 
the right. When the trap drops 
off the rope you have to time 
a jump to the right so you 
will hit the trap and the 
water at the same time. If you 
do it right you will start the 
number one guy without losing 
a man. And if you can get the 
move down you can play 
forever. Just repeat every 
time you lose with the first 
guy. There is a side effect to 
doing this: you will get to
put 
your high score/name in as 
many times as you did the 
trick right. So if you did it 
4 times you will get to put 
your name up 4 times. Kinda 
cool huh? ’

#Double Dragon
$info=ddragon,ddragonb
$icon=ddragon
$data
$bio
Tips and Tricks:



Here's how to get 
infinite points in Double 
Dragon:


Level One, one player grabs 
the whip when it comes out. 
The other player relieves the 
enemy who walks out with a 
bat of that bat. But he does 
*not* kill said enemy. 
Continue moving on until 
you're at the end of stage 
one. At this point the
player WITHOUT the whip grabs 
the now batless enemy. 
The other player finishes the 
stage. Note that when the boss 
man is dead, the clock stops 
running down. Then the player 
tortures the batless one with 
the whip. 200 points per pop, 
and the enemy will NEVER die. 
Switch to non-whip attack to 
kill him, and resume normal 
play.

Notice that player one gets 
all the points for certain 
weapons. Notably the barrel, 
which is important because it 
is reusable. Should player one
die off while player two is 
still alive, player one 
continues to get points for 
the barrel. If this gets him 
over the extra-man mark, he 
gets a ghost player, which is 
limited in the kinds of things 
he can do.

#Elevator Action

$info=elevator,elevator

Tips and Tricks:


If you've got a man in black 
on the floor below as you come 
down in the elevator, jump 
towards him when you're about 
halfway down to his floor. 
You'll jump straight up 
against the floor above and 
then move forward into the 
bad guy as you come down, 
either killing him or 
giving you enough time to 
duck and shoot.


Shoot all the time, especially 
when you get at the hard 
levels. When you are waiting 
for an elevator, shoot 
constantly in the opposite 
direction. That way, you will 
instantly hit an eventual 
enemy (instead of figuring out 
how to deal with him AND the 
guys arriving with the 
elevator).


At the end of each level, if 
you get two red doors at 
opposite sides of the 
building, go down to the 
basement and teleport 
yourself back, instead of 
jumping back and forth.

Galaga is the sequel to
Galaxian. 
Although Galagawas a superior 
game, it didn't sell the large
numbers that it's predecessor
did. 


Tips and Tricks:


There is a well-known cheat 
that causes enemy units to 
stop firing. It works on most 
(but not all) machines. 
Here it is:

On the first stage, kill 
everything but the two bees in 
the bottom left corner. Then 
just wait, dodging the bees' 
shots, until the bee no longer 
drops any shots towards you. 
After the bees stop firing, 
let it pass for 5 more trips 
or so and then kill them. For 
the rest of the game, the 
enemies will not drop shots. 
It will take approximately 
15 minutes for the bees to 
quit shooting at you, so this 
trick requires a lot of 
patience.

Some people have reported 
that this trick also works 
with two bees from the RIGHT 
side of the screen...

Note that, in a 2-player game, 
only one person has to do the 
cheat for both players to 
benefit.


The "Player 1" score counter 
in Galaga is 6 digits, but the
"Player 2" counter is seven 
digits. Therefore, most good 
players start a 2-player game 
and play exclusively on the 
Player 2 side so their score 
won't "roll over" at 999,990.


Challenging stages are easier 
if the high score numbers are 
used to refine your aim. 
These tips assume a 6-digit 
high score:


On the first 2 challenging 
stages, aim your ships so that 
your left set of bullets falls 
between the second and third 
numbers in the high score 
list.

On subsequent challenging 
stages, aim one set of your 
bullets between the first and 
second numbers in the high 
score list(if the units come 
from the left) or between the 
last and next-to-last numbers 
(if the units come from the 
right). This will allow you to 
hit descending enemies at the 
highest possible point.


Here is a neat (and useless) 
Galaga trick: It is possible 
to end the game with a 200% 
ratio. The 200% hit-miss ratio 
trick can only be done with 
your first shot of the game. 
When the game starts, don't 
move, and fire only one shot. 
If you time it correctly, two 
enemies will be killed at 
once. Let your remaining ships 
be destroyed, and presto: a 
better-than-perfect result!


If you have more than 7 extra 
men, the marker for the screen 
will only show 7 1/2 (!) men 
remaining. Additional extra 
ships will still be credited, 
even though they won't show 
on the screen.


Galaga "rolls over" after 
stage 255. After finishing the
255th level, the screen says 
"Stage 0" and the machine 
locks up. I have heard 
unconfirmed reports in the 
past that the "Stage 0" 
problem can be circumvented 
if the last two numbers in 
your score at the end of level 
255 are 80. Others have heard 
that the 255-stage limit may 
not apply if the difficulty 
is set to the hardest level, 
but this is in doubt.


After the 1,000,000 mark, new 
ships are no longer awarded.

#gaplus

$info=gaplus,gaplusa
$icon=gaplus
$data
$bio 
Tips and Tricks:


These tips are all variations 
on the same theme:


On level 1, allow all of the 
enemies to appear and fly into 
formation without shooting any 
of them. After the boss alien 
appears (the one that carries 
the tractor beam attachment), 
you'll see a pulsar similar to 
the ones the aliens appear 
from fly from just above the 
boss alien to the middle-right 
of the screen. Once it's gone 
by, shoot only the second 
alien from the left in the 
bottom row of the formation. 
A "Special" flag will appear 
just below where it was; pick 
it up and you'll get a bonus 
ship.


In Parsec 1, go up to the very 
front and wait for all the 
bugs to come out. Then kill 
the 2nd bug from the left in 
the bottom row to make the 
special flag appear. Now, when 
the boss is coming down, move 
your ship and kill yourself 
by touching it.  Don't touch 
the blaster head, just the 
boss. Your ship is turned into 
the blue one, and go get the 
special flag.


Another approach to the same 
situation:


At the start of the first 
round, push straight up until 
you stop. DON'T shoot! Just 
sit there and let all the bugs 
form. Right after the last row 
of bugs get into formation a 
star will shoot from the top 
left side of the screen to the 
bottom right. If you time this 
right you can get up to 5 
shots on it. After about 10 
hits on the star (it will come 
out at random times during the 
game) it will transform your 
ship into a new ship that can 
shoot 3 shots on the screen 
(3 shots vertically in a row) 
instead of just 2.

Programmed by Ed Logg
and Bob Flanagan


Gauntlet was based on a
computer game known as
Dandy for the Apple II.

(Ed Logg of Atari Games)


The creators of Dandy sued
Atari for plagiarizing their
design. Ed Logg still owns 
the patent on the gameplay.


Tips and Tricks:


If you remain motionless (or 
basically aimless) and stall 
off about 30 health, all of 
the doors will open. Everybody 
knows this, and the game even 
tells you about it. The game 
doesn't tell you that if you 
stall off about 200 health, 
all the walls will turn into 
exits!

The game designers had to 
include this because there are 
some levels which require you 
to pick up a key before you 
exit. If you are already 
filled up with keys, and the 
doors are all gone, then it 
would be *impossible* for you 
to exit, and you would starve 
to death.

What they didn't anticipate, 
is that certain levels of the 
game which are really 
difficult, which would require 
you to take massive health 
losses to finish, become very 
simple if all the walls are 
exits. Or they can be 
effectively skipped 
altogether.

Because the game has Monty-
Hall levels with lots of food 
on them, you can use this 
cheat to only play levels 
which are a wash or increase 
your health dramatically, and
cut your losses to 200 on all 
the really hard levels.

All you need to live forever 
as the Warrior is extra shot
power! This way you can kill 
everything in exactly one
shot. 
This allows you to do 
precision firing and gives 
you a level of control over 
your shots that no other c
haracter can achieve.

The best character to play, 
in the *long* run, is the elf. 
His magic is just as good as 
the wizard's and his fight 
ability as good as Thor's. 
His ability to shoot through 
cracks in addition to all 
this (when he has the power 
potions) makes him the best. 
The Valkyrie is the worst, 
although some people regard 
this as a challenge...


To manipulate the point value 
of Death, shoot him. Death's 
point value takes the 
following progression:  
1000-2000-1000-4000-1000-6000-
1000-8000, and then back to 
start. His value keeps from 
the previous game.

You can kill Death painlessly 
by teleporting on top of him.

Level 8 is the level that the 
previous game ended on. If you 
got a really good sequence of 
boards in a game and you want 
to repeat them, turn the 
machine off and on again after 
you've entered your high
score.

multi-player
mode.


Tips and Tricks:


Once you get to the thief/
mugger levels you can wait for 
the thief to appear and shoot 
him. He will appear in the 
same space you start the level 
on: shoot him and his money 
bag will appear. Do not pick 
up the money bag - it will 
cover his entrance onto the 
board, and therefore he may 
not appear until his entrance 
space is clear. This is not a 
good tactic because of the 
amount of time wasted to do 
this.It should only be used 
on long boards.

You may also stop the thief/
mugger by pushing a movable 
block across your own path. 
The thief/mugger will follow 
your own trail - footstep for 
footstep! Therefore you can 
run, find a movable block and 
circle around and cover your 
own trail by pushing the block 
to cover your trail. Note: if 
you re-cross your own trail, 
the thief/mugger will take 
the shortest route to catch 
you.


If you are playing two +
player 
you can kill almost all
dragons 
with one player diverting his 
attention, or using an
indirect 
attack. For example: you can 
find shootable walls or just 
stand in the right spot askew 
from the dragon. He will try 
to flame instead of fire-ball. 
If done correctly, you will 
be standing a wall away from 
him. Then your partner can go 
around and shoot flame head 
while the dragon is flaming 
away.


The 200 tick trick (see 
Gauntlet I) is now the 900 
tick trick. The game doesn't 
seem to have an ending, just 
like Gauntlet I. Others have 
claimed it isn't 900 but some 
other number. This number can 
probably be adjusted by the 
operator.


In this game there are 'secret 
rooms'. To get to a secret 
room, perform a secret trick 
on a level. Some of the secret 
tricks are:

* Teleporting into the exit

* Pushing a movable wall into 
the exit

* Keeping all the super shots

* Not using invulnerability 
(this is almost always a good 
idea anyway)

* Not touching a fake exit

* Teleporting on top of Death 
and/or acid blobs

* Not taking ANYTHING (the
tick 
trick comes in handy here)


The hints it gives to the 
secret room don't necessarily 
apply to your current level, 
just as on Gauntlet I. The 
secret trick usually doesn't 
work, but it is always same 
for any given board. You're 
allowed one secret trick for 
every 15 levels or so.


You can kill the acid blobs! 
Just drop 2 potions in quick 
succession. This works 
regardless of your magic 
ability. It also puts the 
dragon back to sleep 
momentarily. (You can also 
kill them with a teleporter. 
If there's a teleporter handy, 
that is.)


The ? foods are NOT random. 
Grab a ? food on health mod 20
 == 7. You'll get 200 health.

Couple of strategy notes: 
Reflective shots make the 
dragon easier. 
Invulnerability makes him 
very easy :) And remember that 
when generators aren't on the 
screen, they don't generate 
monsters.

Tips and Tricks:


There is a place in the cave 
scene (the short scene right 
after you kill the two big 
ogres), where you can get 
100K before the time runs out 
and you can repeat this every 
life, getting 3 lives for 2 
deaths (until the game stops 
giving extra lives at 980K). 
The spot is on the upper 
level to the right of the 
rock and just to the left of 
the second ladder. Move the 
joystick back and forth 
rapidly at the spot and fire 
each time you change 
directions. This causes a 
zombie to appear at the edge 
of the screen with each pivot 
you make and each shot you 
fire will kill a zombie. You 
can get 100K+ from this if 
you're fast enough!


It is well known that if you 
duck and shoot a tombstone 15 
times, an angel appears and 
fires a bolt that turns you 
into a frog. Interesting bug: 
if you fire this bolt *just* 
as your time is about to run 
out, you'll turn into a frog 
INSTEAD of being killed by 
time over. It wraps around to 
negative time or something 
and you have virtually 
unlimited time. (He 
recommends standing two rock-
lengths away from the rock, 
and firing the 15th shot at 
time 0:02. If you're just 
slightly late, the bolt will 
still 'reincarnate' you but 
your character will appear 
distorted and you will be 
stuck in a ducked position). 
Use this trick in combination 
with the above cave trick, 
and you're pretty much set. 
If you perform the above 
trick but don't get the 
timing correct, your frog/man 
will be split in two and very 
messy in aspect.  The game is 
much harder for a scrambled 
knight!


Boss tricks:


Dragon trick - You can pass 
the level four dragon by 
fleeing! Just walk until music 
changes to boss theme (if you 
can't hear that, the spot is 
where you have the last two 
flames on the left of the 
screen), then go to extreme 
left: if everything is okay, 
the music should stop and the 
flames freeze. Go to the door 
to collect the key.


Demon trick - To make 
the demon boss disappear at 
the end of level five, try 
running away from him as fast 
as you can!

Reach the floor with the hole 
in it and jump through it. If 
you have correct timing, you 
will fall in the pit, 
avoiding the moving platforms, 
and eventually escape the 
boss. Ogre boss tricks - The 
ogre bosses tend to jump when 
you fire, even if not directly 
at them. This is very useful 
in level six, when you can 
avoid losing your armor by 
activating the ogres, then 
going down the ladder and 
firing while holding your man 
in the same position where he 
starts at the beginning of the 
level.


Other tricks:


Weapon trick - After having 
defeated a level boss(es),the 
knight can fire two or three 
"invisible shots"; if the man 
is facing the right border of 
the screen while doing so, the 
shots will reappear in the 
following stage. This can be 
exploited to kill some of the 
skulls at beginning of level 
six (soooo useful...).


Fire bridge trick - If the 
game difficulty level is not 
set to hard (you can check 
this by the zombies' speed), 
the fire bridge can be 
traversed by simply going 
right without topping.


Weird spots - In levels five 
and six there are spots where 
you can jump through the 
yellow rock background: 
usually getting blocked or 
killed. In level six, the 
floor below the bosses' has an 
invisible hole in it at the 
extreme left: this can be used 
to the player's advantage.


Cemetary glitch - Reach the 
last tomb before the devil, 
jump it and go right two or 
three steps. The knight should 
now be in front of a tree on 
the background. Don't go any 
further - go back, instead. 
Climb the first ladder you'll 
meet, then climb down the one 
on the left, which shouldn't
be 
completely on the screen if 
you performed the trick 
correctly: surprise!


Warp trick - This is very odd:  
by a strategy similar to the 
one to reveal the cemetary 
glitch (that is, fiddling with 
scroll), you can activate a 
"level warp" in the platform 
section at the beginning of 
level four. It involves going 
right, then trying to have 
some platform carry you 
beyond the "scroll stops" line 
on the left. This should kill 
the knight and possibly make 
the next life start on the 
fire bridge or in level 5.


There are two 10,000 pts. in 
the game. The first one is in 
the forest: jump somewhere 
before the last plant. To 
collect the second, go in the 
leftmost spot you can reach 
after you have landed on the 
bottom of level three; that is 
the place where you go to the 
dragon boss by simply running 
right.


Armor:


The first armor is in the 
cemetary, between the red 
devil's starting position and 
last money bag: jump there to 
catch it. In the forest, 
there's the infamous 
unreachable armor: to collect 
it you should reach a spot 
just above the money bag right 
after the first plant. This 
cannot be done by jumping.


There are two armors in the 
ice palace. One can be gotten 
by walking left off the 
topmost platform; the other 
will fall right in front of 
the inferior plant by roaming 
around the other plant's 
location.

There are two armors in the 
blue cave. The first one is 
obtained by climbing the 
leftmost ladder and falling 
off the ledge. To get the 
second, perform a well-placed 
jump (you have to cross some 
precise point in mid-air while 
falling) before the fight with 
the last red devil.

The last armor is collected in 
level six by simply walking 
right on the first floor with 
hulk-like monsters on it. I'm 
sure the programmers thought 
you couldn't avoid getting hit 
by the ogres and so they 
didn't hide that armor.

#Gladiator

Tips and Tricks:


The red sword: If you get all 
the flying swords that attack 
you on the "walking" levels by 
defending them and tapping 
down, you get the red sword. 
If you have it, and you 
repeatedly attack an enemy, 
you will become invincible for 
a while and your armor will be 
replenished.


The golden shield: You pick it 
up on the "walking" levels. It 
does not downgrade from 
missiles like the normal
sheilds do.


You can pick up Irene's sword 
in level 1, and Zaid's mace in 
level 2 (stronger weapon, 
specially useful against 
Agathon and the rolling 
barrels)


You can break all the enemy's 
swords (and Zaid's mace) by 
hitting them constantly.


A tip to defeat Irene: lower 
your shield and she will only 
use low = attacks. Break her 
sword (see above).


**Special trick: How to strip 
Irene's clothes off!

This trick works only (as far 
as I know) on the Japanese 
version (Ohgon no Siro). The 
American version is censored.

After breaking her sword, if 
her shield is not entirely 
broken, break it. Irene, 
unlike the other characters, 
has TWO suits of armor. DO NOT 
KILL HER! Try to remove as 
many parts of the armor as you 
can, throwing careful attacks. 
Focus especially on her 
chestplate and on the... uh...
"thighplate"?. After you've 
done that, defeat her BY 
ATTACKING HER LEGS. She will 
fall on her knees, with her 
sword on her hands against her 
chest. When you pass her, she 
extends her arms towards you 
and... HELLO!

Tips and Tricks:


If possible, go to a different 
level of ground than your 
opponent. If you are lower, 
you can cut up his legs and he 
can't hit you. If you are 
higher, he will jump after you 
and you can hit him in mid-
jump. (He won't attack until 
he's on your level).


Two Player health restore: If 
a player's health is at zero 
(no life bar visible) when the 
bonus level/intermission ends, 
s/he will begin the next level 
at full health (three life 
bars). So if you CAREFULLY 
hack one another, you can 
restore your health. You 
should allow the other 
character to recover after 
each swipe, otherwise you may 
throw or kick and actually 
kill the other player.

Tips and Tricks:


A well known gravitar cheat/
bug is as follows... At a 
joint between two vectors (>90 
degrees), position yourself 
below and shoot straight up. 
If you can align yourself just 
right, the shots will travel 
through the walls at the
joint. 
Without moving from side to 
side, just thrust up and
viola, 
you are now inside the wall. 
You can now move around and 
shoot the gun pods from

After designing Time

that, although a hit, came
out at a time when the arcade

Gyruss is most often

#Heavy Barrel
$info=hbarrel,hbarrelj
$icon=hbarrel
$data
$bio
Tips and Tricks:


Here's a complete Heavy Barrel 
strategy guide, courtesy of 
Julius Yang:


The objective is to wipe out 
a military complex filled 
with soldiers and lethal 
military equipment. The 
available weapons are the 
standard machine gun, the 
heavy machine gun, the fan
gun,
the flame thrower, and the 
Heavy Barrel. Grenade weapons 
include standard grenades, red 
grenades, and ball and chains.

The Heavy Barrel is a super 
weapon that you obtain after 
getting six special pieces 
that glow yellow when you 
unlock boxes with keys. It has 
unlimited ammunition, unlike 
other guns, but it has a time 
limit. It destroys everything 
you hit with it.


Throughout the game there are 
only enough pieces to get the 
gun three times, but if you do 
this you will have to face a
very tough section without it. 
The final machine is nearly 
impossible to destroy without 
the Heavy Barrel, so you ought 
to save parts until you have 
five, then get the last box 
that contains a special part.

At the start, you will 
parachute in. Massacre a bunch 
of guys until you encounter a 
man with a tripod machine gun. 
Kill him, then get the heavy 
machine gun weapon. Use this 
to wipe out the small tank 
next to the bridge.

Four boxes to the left of the 
bridge will be there. A heavy 
barrel part is in the second 
box from the right. Pick up 
the flame-thrower, and start 
whaling on the guards and 
flying packs that come from 
across the bridge. After 
they're dead, a chopper will 
fly in and attempt to kill
you. 
Throw grenades at it, don't 
waste the flame-thrower. 
Presuming you have sufficient 
dodge skill, you can kill the
chopper before it overwhelms 
you with bullets.

Across the bridge, a huge 
number of guys will attack 
you. Here is where the flame-
thrower is useful--it takes
out 
a lot of guys at once. Next to 
the pyramid machine gun are 
three boxes--kill the gun, 
then open up the leftmost box. 
That reveals a red grenade 
icon. Pick that up, and start 
grenading your way to the
gate.

At the gate, grenade everyone 
to death (you have 70 grenades 
to start with!) and keep 
pushing forward.

I don't remember the exact 
locations of any more Heavy 
Barrel pieces (except for the 
last one), but general 
strategies for dealing with 
tough parts I can give:

At three points in the game 
you will be on a moving 
platform. In anticipation of 
these difficult points you 
should have red grenades and 
fan guns or a flame-thrower. 
If guys jump on the platform 
you ought to grenade them, 
since the gun should always be 
saved for blowing away heavy 
machinery. The first platform 
is a series of cannons which 
can be destroyed with a single 
grenade, then a series of 
guards which can be destroyed 
if you throw a red grenade to 
the exact center of the
screen. 
At the end is a machine with 
large grabbers that extend 
towards you. Stay on the left 
of the platform, and start 
flaming it and hurling 
grenades simultaneously. 
The machine rarely grabs on 
the left, so with luck you 
should be able to destroy it 
without a loss.

The second platform passes by 
a million cannons (exaggerated
only slightly) and it is 
imperative that you destroy as
many as possible as soon as 
possible, since they FOLLOW 
the platform and shoot large 
cannonballs at you. Here is 
where dodging is useful, since 
it's hard to keep the number 
of cannonballs on the screen 
below 20.

The third platform consists of 
a series of flying guards that 
seem ok, until TWO of the 
mechanical grabber things show 
up!
Fortunately one attacks first, 
on the right, so you should 
stay on the left and disable 
it ASAP, then switch right and 
disable the other.

There is, at some point in the 
game, a narrow bridge which is 
the killing zone for two 
helicopters. You should have 
good weapons, and run up while 
facing backwards. Hopefully 
you can flame a copter to 
death, after which you can 
dodge the other until you kill 
it. If you die, pick up the 
fan gun sitting on the bridge, 
and use it.

At another point you will be 
confronted with two conveyor 
belts (which you cannot ride) 
going in opposite directions. 
Due to the obstructions in the 
middle you ought to use the 
Heavy Barrel here to blow 
everyone away, and run through 
like crazy.

At another point you will have 
to run a gauntlet of cannons 
and grenade- throwing guards. 
To deal with this, DON'T use
the HB, since you will not be 
able to get enough parts to 
kill the last guy. You should 
get a flame-thrower, and fire 
left even before the enemies 
show up on the screen. They 
will die, and you can walk 
left to get more weapons as 
they show up.

Another large machine spits 
out glowing needles that split 
into three parts and angle 
downwards. You should dodge 
left and right methodically 
while tossing grenades and 
firing. Don't look at the 
machine! Just keep doing that 
while looking at the needles 
and dodging. Lives are much 
more important than keeping a 
hoard of weapons.

At one point you will meet 
three Predator-like creatures. 
You can destroy these three 
using machine gun or simple
grenades, though they look 
tough! Only one or two fire 
slow shots at a time, so you 
can dodge them. Keep pumping
bullets into them until one 
explodes.

The final gauntlet is hell. 
Enemy guards throw red 
grenades right and left, 
copters keep charging you, and 
more predators show up. You 
should keep moving forward, 
never getting stuck in 
position, since if you press 
on you ought to be able to get 
the grenade throwers before 
they let off one throw. Keep 
your ammo well stocked by 
picking up new guns, even if 
you still have 20 shots left. 
Red grenades are essential 
here--the ball and chain is 
too slow to deal with so many
guys.

You are near the end when you 
drive off the laughing guy...
pick up the next box on the 
left, get the Heavy Barrel, 
walk north, and finish the 
game.

A few obvious reminders--you 
can only carry four keys, so 
if you have four and more are 
lying around, open up boxes.
They can contain extra lives, 
shields, red grenades, 
weapons, a cloud gun (which is 
virtually useless), and HB 
parts. Learning where the HB 
parts are is pretty important 
too. But most essential is 
learning when to conserve your 
ammo and when to cut loose 
with everything you have.

The high score is essentially 
meaningless, since at the end 
you have about 400k points and 
you get 1 million for killing
the last guy.

Tips and Tricks:


Some tips for each event:

SWIMMING: Don't start bashing 
the buttons until your 
character comes to the surface 
after the dive into the water.

To stay under water longer
(and 
get a head start), hold down 
the left and right buttons 
while diving.

The BREATH sign comes on every 
10 meters so you can 
anticipate this when you get 
used to playing. 

Also, if you finish in exactly 
the same time as another 
(human) player, a bonus is 
awarded.


SKEET SHOOTING: If you manage 
to shoot all of the clays, the 
last one appears as a bird and 
bags 5000 points. This bird
usually comes from the right 
side of the screen. Shooting 
it with the left barrel makes 
a slow-moving parrot appear. 
Shoot the parrot as many times 
as you can!

Also, on level B (the level 
is shown in the top left 
corner of the screen - starts 
a,b,c,d for the pattern and a 
number for the number of times 
round) you can shoot the first 
two skeets with a single shot, 
giving you an extra bonus. Be 
sure and shoot both skeets 
with the left-hand button.


VAULTING: Try to get as far as 
possible on the springboard 
before pressing the jump 
button.

When on the horse, wait for 
the athlete to be vertical 
before pressing the button to 
make him push off - this gives
him more height.

A secret bonus can be obtained 
if you land on your head 
without doing any somersaults. 
You will bounce a few times on 
the floor and a frog will 
appear from the roof and give 
you bonus points. This is 
useful if you have already 
qualified as it is dead easy 
to obtain.


ARCHERY: There is a 5,000 
point bonus for getting all 
"nices" (600 pts), giving a 
total of over 9,000 points.


WEIGHTLIFTING: When you have 
successfully lifted the weight 
and the athlete drops the bar 
to the floor, if you press 
both left and right buttons at 
the same time as it hits the 
floor, cheerleaders will 
appear and give you a bonus. 
This is quite tricky to 
perform as your timing has to 
be extremely accurate.


POLE VAULT: To gain extra 
height when you have let go of 
the pole press the left and 
right buttons quickly to gain 
height and press the jump 
button to move to the right 
faster.

If you put your pole directly 
into the hole without losing 
any speed and your vault is 
successful, a mole appears 
from the ground to award you 
1000 points. If you continue

I, Robot was originally Ice
Castles, and was three boards
rather than two. Atari had
this
stupid policy that bonuses for
engineers were based on
profits from sales of
machines,
*without* taking into account
the amount of engineering
resources (man years) spent
developing it. I.e., just the
sales
revenue minus the
manufacturing cost. Therefore
engineers were motivated to
spend ridiculous amounts of
time reducing the
manufacturing
cost. They decided that the
only 
way to reduce the cost of the
game was to replace a lot of
TTL
logic with an ASIC.
Unfortunately, they assigned
very
inexperienced people to do the
ASIC design. The resulting
chip
had very low yield; I don't
think
*any* of them worked over the
normal voltage and temperature
ranges that commercial
semiconductors are normally
rated for. However, by this
time
the game was so late that they
weren't allowed to fix the
ASIC.
Aside from the time it would
take to redo the chip, fixing
it
would also require putting it
in
a larger package with more
power and ground pins, and so
the board would have to be
redone as well. So for each
production unit they just
tried
chips until they found one
that
seemed to work, then shipped
the unit. They threw away a
lot
of chips.

The game had a limited
production quantity of 1,000
units with half being exported
to Japan.


Tips and Tricks:


Hold down both start buttons 
when entering the transporter 
on level 1. You can now warp 
as high as level 10.

(Note from Roger: The 
following may be a trick that 
exploits a bug in an early 
ROM version, or it may be 
selectable through dip switch 
settings. Can someone let me 
know if it's possible with the 
current I, Robot emulator?)

Background:

In I, Robot, one must jump on 
each red block (without 
getting zapped by the Big Eye, 
running into an obstacle, 
etc.) and then attempt to 
leave that wave (by moving/
jumping to the doorway under 
the Big Eye) before the timer
elapsed. Bonus points were 
awarded based on time 
remaining.


The "Feature":

*Some* machines would allow 
you to reset the bonus timer 
as it was ticking down. The 
timer would reset to 9999 and
continue to rack up points. 
This could be repeated many, 
many times, thus allowing the 
player to virtually choose his 
own score.


Activating the "Feature":

While the bonus timer is 
ticking down, press the left 
"vantage" button (one of two 
buttons which let you raise/
lower your vantage point) and 
release it. If your machine 
has the reset "feature", the 
timer will reset to 9999 and 
continue ticking down.

Note: I believe it was the 
left "vantage change" button, 
but it may have been the one 
on the right.

Used digitized faces of the

members, photographed with a 
camera designed by Ralph Baer, 
father of the home video game
console. The machine contained
a tape loop of the song
"Separate Ways (World's
Apart)"
in the concert scene at the
end of each level. 


Rushed through the 1982
Christmas holidays by the
Marvin Glass team because
Bally/Midway wanted the game
to coincide with the release
of the band's Frontiers
album. They took all the
images
of the band backstage at a
Salt
Lake City concert. There was
talk of using the game as part
of
the road show, but that fell
though. 


Tips and Tricks:


On Journey's attract screen 
(the one with the face), press 
all the buttons (BLAST, 1P, 
2P) and the joystick to the 
left and you'll get a screen 
with the programmer's names 
and tiny digitized pictures. 
It didn't work for me at

around with the self test dip 
switch it came up... so keep 
trying! (Can anyone give me

Early machines had
a bug that allowed players to
rack up millions of points by
standing on the middle plat-
form and killing pterodactyls
endlessly, or until they got
tired and gave up.

Another bug that became a "cut
-throat" feature was the
ability
to belly-flop and squeeze
between tight gaps in
staggered
platforms.


Joust: The Movie? Yes, John
has a pet project of making a
movie using the state-of-the-
art technology that exists
today. A game flyer by
Williams perfectly sets the
mood for this game: "His
majesty King Williams will
receive his many subjects at
his magnificent Joust
tournament in ye Land of
Molten Magma and Stoned
Clouds. Whereat all able and
brave knights shalt ride their
bird and shalt fight with
lance
ye evil enemies."


Tips and Tricks:


"The pterodactyl trick". 
Classic trick. Doesn't work on 
upgraded Joust machines, or on 
Joust II. Trick the last 
jouster on the stage to fly to 
the lava and get trapped by 
the lava troll. Then wait in 
the center of the middle 
platform. When a pterodactyl 
comes out, it'll fly right 
into your lance. The next part 
takes a fair amount of 
practice: when the pterodactyl 
has hit you, your character 
will be knocked back. Jiggle 
the joystick so that your 
mount is back in the middle 
of the ledge again. Keep 
doing this. Eventually 
there'll be a steady stream 
of pterodactyls, and you'll 
be killing 'em about 2 per 
second, for 1000 points each. 
When you make a mistake and 
get killed, the trapped 
jouster will escape.

On the last board in which 
this works (47 I think), the 
jouster will not escape.

Come in from the right, and 
land on the lower platform so 
that your legs can't come 
down; you'll bounce along the
platform. On old ROM machines,
you will then fall down 
through the gap between the 
platforms; on the new ROM, 
you'll bounce off.


You can screw up Joust by 
killing a Pterodactyl right 
inside the screen border as it 
moves from right to left. 
(Very hard to do - plus it's 
worthless, but it is of 
interest as it sometimes shows 
internal info on the screen if 
done at the right vertical 
height from top. Different 
locations apparently cause 
different screw-ups.)


The key to handling Shadow 
Lords (blue guys) is learning 
how to time their bounces at
the top of the screen. Also, 
a good spot to be at the 
beginning of a wave is 
immediately to the left or 
right of a ledge and above. 
Shadow Lords will then appear 
and fly right up into you.


To get an extra 1000 points on 
every screen, leave an egg on 
the middle left or right 
platform. Wait until the 
pterodactyl comes out. Let it 
fly up to the middle level. As 
soon as it is high enough, 
grab the egg. The pterodactyl 
will try to exit the screen, 
you should be able to run 
towards it, and kill it just 
as it goes off the to the 
side. 


More tips on hunting
pterodactyls:

On levels without a middle 
platform, the safest place to 
kill them is on the left hand 
side of the bottom platform. 
Position yourself over Player 
1's 100,000 number.

On levels with a middle 
platform: Wait on the right 
hand side, near the edge.


More tips on defeating Shadow 
Lords (blue enemies):

If there is a middle platform 
on the screen, always stay 
under it!

Shadow Lords that approach 
from the right-hand side will 
start "bouncing" off the 
platform and give you time to 
wait for them. As they hit the 
bottom, flap up a little and 
they will fly into you. If 
they approach from the left, 
they won't bounce but you can
still use the same method to 
kill them.


For lots of extra points: 
During the egg waves, don't 
pick up the eggs - let them 
all hatch. But kill them 
quickly, or else the 
pterodactyl will come out 
sooner.


The wave counter stops at 99, 
and then goes to 0. Then it 
begins over at level 1. 
However, the game never gets 
easier. Around level 60 or so, 
all the enemies are Shadow 
Lords (Blue).

The original game was called
Jungle King and featured a
character who looked like
the well known and very
much copyrighted Tarzan.
The character even sounded
like Tarzan when he bellowed
out the famous Tarzan scream
after finishing the boulder
stage
(and at the beginning of the
game).
So, for legal reasons, the
name
was changed to Jungle Hunt and
the character was changed to
resemble a classic jungle
explorer
complete with the standard
issue
safari hat and shorts. The
bellowed
scream at the end of the
boulder
stage was also entirely
removed.


There was also another version
of this game released, called

Tips and Tricks:


This trick makes level 
clearing relatively easy until 
at least the 4th Dan. First, 
get close to your opponent, 
then push left joystick up and 
right joystick down to do a 
forward flip to get behind 
your opponent. Then you can do 
a back kick, or back jumping 
kick and get him almost all 
the time before he has a 
chance to turn around and do a 
move on you. On the 4th Dan, 
he's fast enough to start 
making moves before you can.

Tips and Tricks:


Time your punches properly. 
They give you double score 
compared with the kicks, but 
they're much more risky, as 
you an fall short with your 
punch and get grabbed.


If you feel like you don't 
want to fight, when a knife 
thrower appears behind you, 
evade his first knives, clean 
the screen and start to 
advance non-stop, cleaning the 
henchmen in your way. There 
won't be any new badasses 
appearing from your back, and 
it's a lot quicker and easier. 
Perhaps it's a bit tricky to 
avoid the knives at your back 
while you are cleaning your 
path ahead, but you are a kung 
fu master, aren't you?


FIRST BOSS: Easy. Wait to his 
first pole swing from a safe 
distance and then quickly get 
close (stuck) to him. From now 
on, his attacks won't hit you. 
Walk forward (making him walk 
back) until you reach the 
staircases and then start 
punching him in the belly.


SECOND BOSS: First, clean your 
back of henchmen. Then, wait 
for the boomerang dude to
throw his first boomerang, 
avoid it and this is the time! 
You have to hit him like hell 
while he's waiting to recover 
his boomerang. Punches hurt 
double. If you're quick enough 
punching, he won't recover his 
first boomerang.


THIRD BOSS: My favorite one. 
Just make a jumping moving 
kick, hit him in the chest, 
and as soon you touch the 
floor (falling down from the 
jumping kick) start punching 
fast as hell! With any luck he 
won't touch you anyway. Be 
sure to have spare energy to 
perform this movement just in 
case he has time to give you a 
kick (1/4 of the bar would be 
enough).


FOURTH BOSS: Watch out, this 
one is tricky. First, take him 
to the limits where he can 
walk (He suddenly stops as he 
can't get closer to you). Then 
come closer to him and duck, 
avoiding his projectiles.
Then, 
a copy of him will appear at 
your back. Stand up and start 
walking (avoiding projectiles 
again) just as you did with 
the first boss. As soon as you 
arrive at the stairs, duck and 
start punching. He will appear 
and disappear, but JUST in 
front of you. Six punches and 
he's history.


FIFTH BOSS: Mainly keep him 
defending himself with high 
kicks (tapping very fast!) and 
then suddenly change to low 
kicks. I usually start with a 
jumping moving kick in the 
chest (just like the third 
boss) and then start the high/
low kicks patterns. I've 
played so much that I can add 
some low punches to the mix, 
but if you want to survive, 
stick to the pattern.

Tip: Do yourself a favor and
avoid being sucked into the
open mouths in the middle of
the levels. They waste time
and lives. From an arcade
gaming design standpoint, it
was a nifty idea to get you to
keep spending quarters to
get through the time wasting
levels until you would fight
the end of the level boss.


Tips and Tricks:


On each level, a trio of 
statues arranged in a 
triangular pattern will appear 
about three-quarters of the 
way through. Bomb them until 
one of them reveals a 
passageway (you'll have to 
bomb them all; it's not the 
same one every time), and fly 
into it. You'll now be in a 
cave, free to fly along and 
collect treasure chests worth 
200 points apiece. When you're 
in the cave, though, don't 
shoot - if you fire and hit a
treasure chest it's destroyed, 
and some of the cavern walls 
release enemies when shot.

Lunar Lander was inspired 
by MOONLANDER, which was
written by Jack Burness in 
1973 as a demo for the DEC 
GT40 vector graphics terminal 
(based on a PDP-11/05 CPU).


This game used a light pen to 
control thrust and rotation. 
If you landed at exactly the 
right spot, a McDonalds 
appeared. The astronaut would 
come out, walk over to the 
McDonalds and order a Big Mac 
to go, walk back, and take off
again. If you crashed ON the 
McDonalds, it would print out 
"You clod! You've destroyed 
the only McDonald's on the 
Moon!"


Atari's first vector game.
After
a short run of Lunar Lander
machines were manufactured, 
production was shifted over to 
Asteroids, and the first few
hundred Asteroids machines
were housed in Lunar Lander
cabinets. 


Atari donated a gold edition
version of the coin-operated
video game to the Discovery
Center of Science &
Technology in Syracuse, New
York.

Tips and Tricks:


There are three stages I feel 
one needs to take to finish 
the game on one quarter:


1.FOOD: The duration of your 
game depends on your vitality 
and your vitality depends on 
how much food you can get. 
There are several tricks to 
accomplish this.


a. Magic Scroll. Definitely 
the most important item in the 
game you could have. 
Unfortunately you can have it 
for only 2 levels per find. As 
stated before it allows better 
probability of food being 
dropped from monsters.  The 
scroll is hard to find at the 
low levels(1-20+) so you have 
to depend on surviving for a 
while. The absolute BEST time 
in the game to have the scroll 
is level 33. The 
level with the swarms of 
Jellyfish. With average luck 
and prayers you can get 2 or 3
lobsters, and about 4 or 5 
smaller food values like 
mushrooms and tomatoes. The 
tough part is acquiring this 
very lifesaver (Scroll). The 
only way, besides hoping the 
ninja on that level has one 
(100-1), is to acquire one 
from the previous level, #32. 
To do this you have to hope 
and PRAY one of the Samurai 
gives you one when you kill 
them. This will not always 
work. There is however, an 
alternative way of getting a 
scroll. It is on level 32 of 
the ALTERNATIVE path that one 
can be GUARANTEED a magic 
scroll. The hard part then is 
keeping it to when you need it 
for the jellyfish. All those 
stupid skeletons dropping 
crystal balls can be a pain. 

b. Alternative paths. Take 
those RED levels!!! Sure 
they're harder, but oh, that 
food at the later levels as 
well as the points are REALLY 
nice down the stretch. 

c. Earlier Levels. Master 
those levels! Find every nook 
and cranny where food can be 
found. Don't get hit! Build 
your vitality! 


2.COMPANION CHOICE: Here is a 
list of the 8 different 
companions to choose from that 
are probably most valuable for 
survival.

1.Lizard Man. Best in the game 
by far. His shot speed along 
with power makes him ESSENTIAL 
for certain boss monsters.

2.Thief. His bombs are great 
but knowing where those 
randomly placed trapped chests 
are is a definite boon. Build 
him from the VERY start.

3.Knight. Supposedly the best 
in the game. His shot speed is 
lacking and the opportunity to 
increase his levels is awkward 
and not well placed except at 
level 48 when he is guaranteed 
level 8.

4.The others. Not worth taking 
EVER unless you want variety 
or a challenge. Try winning 
with the priest from ground 
zero. It's a bitch!


3.POINT MAXIMIZATION: Only 
through learning the previous 
2 steps can this one ever be 
contemplated. Whenever you 
find a necklace, grab it! Milk 
the 2 levels you have it of 
ALL its points! Through the 
use of this, and learning 
where all the Blue Gems
(flames) are you can get 
scores over 5,000,000. If you 
include the Diamond, 6
Million.


MIND-BLOWING SCORES FROM HELL: 
Level 47. That's all there is 
to it. As long as you have a 
good amount of vitality (3+) 
you can grab the necklace and 
WREAK HAVOC on points. The 
biggest thing to note is that 
a necklace is available on 
this level. Grab it and go 
back to the platform at the 
beginning of the level and 
wait for those weird things 
with the floating skulls 
around them to appear. Give a 
blast of Magic (hit both 
buttons). All the skulls turn 
into 8000 pt coins (16000 if 
you have the necklace). Repeat 
until time is running out or 
you are almost dead. The level 
has SOOOO much food you can 
still easily finish the game.

An extra 1,000,000 points is 
available on blue level 30: 
there is a wizard there who 
levitates rocks. Jump and
sword 
him once, and then when he 
causes the rocks, to appear
use 
magic (both buttons) to turn 
the rocks into 8K gold pieces. 
You can do this until time 
runs out.

On level 47, pick up the 
double-point necklace, then 
use magic to destroy the 
wizard that keeps appearing 
(but wait till the instant the 
skulls around him
materialize). 
They'll all turn into 8K GP's, 
doubled by your necklace. If 
you don't get hit by any of 
the dogs or red ghosts you can 
break even on this, since a 
food fairy appears just about
every time you repeat this 
twice.

On level 49, bring the enemy 
as far to the left in the 
level as it's possible to go. 
Then kill him. While you're 
immune (for about 5 seconds 
after it dies), jump into the 
spikes to your left and open 
the far left chest. There's a 
jewel inside, worth 1 million 
pts.

The best way to get it is to 
kill the chimera (nasty dragon 
thingy) on the left side of 
the level and walk safely 
through the spikes while the 
screen vibrates.

Gameplay innovation at its
finest. A game that would have
done greater numbers had 
anyone cared in 1984. Only 
500-600 dedicated machines
were manufactured.


Mark Cerny came in the 
middle of the design, adding
one of the space waves (the
flying fish) and the last 4
base ship mazes. He also
added some objects to the 
mazes (such as the gun and
floating boots) and helped
clean up old items that
never got shipped.

(Owen Rubin, programmer, as
told to Brian Deuel)



Tips and Tricks:


It's possible to warp to 
higher levels in Major Havoc 
from the start of the game by 
using certain codes. This is 
useful to not only be able to 
get through the game more 
quickly, but each warp also 
gives a fairly hefty bonus for 
carrying it out. This is done
by playing the mini-Breakout 
game at the bottom right-hand 
corner of the screen when the 
game starts.

The game will have a phrase 
such as, "Enter Red Warp 00" 
at the bottom of the screen. 
What you do is use the 
controls to 'dial in' the 
first digit of the appropriate 
code given below, then press 
fire to serve the ball and 
repeat as necessary. The codes 
are:

Color..Code...Bonus....Level
.Red....23....250,000....4
Yellow..46....600,000....9
.Green..824...700,000...10
.Aqua...315...950,000...13
.Blue...223......?......?
Purple..683......?......?
Rainbow.948......?......?


Note that you can only enter 
the codes in the order they're 
given - it's not possible to 
enter, say, the red warp code 
followed directly by the aqua 
warp code.


Build up unlimited turns (for 
the very patient) by replaying 
level 13 (turning on/off the 
reactor and exiting) over and 
over again to win turns off 
points.

#Mappy

$icon= mappy

Tips and Tricks:


Here's how to get through the 
first four bonus levels on 
Mappy with a 10,000-point
bonus on each one:

Each bonus level has a 
different pattern to it. Where
you are told to 'break 
through the trampoline(s)', 
this involves holding the 
joystick to one side so that 
Mappy repeatedly bounces off 
of an adjacent wall, 
resulting in the trampoline 
breaking as quickly as 
possible. Note that this only 
refers to trampolines which 
are *not* at the bottom of 
the screen.


1st Bonus: sting all the 
balloons and break through 
all trampolines.

2nd Bonus: sting all but the 
last balloon on the left, and 
break through to release Goro. 
He'll pop it.

3rd Bonus: sting all but the 
leftmost balloon at the top 
then break through to release 
Goro. He'll pop the 
remaining balloon.

4th Bonus: sting all the 
balloons to the *left*, but 
leave the one immediately 
above where you start un-
popped. Release Goro, and 
he'll bounce over to it, 
destroying it.

Information about Mappy 
levels: The mapping of the 
level counters in Mappy is a 
little strange;

after level 49, the level 
symbols in the bottom right 
corner temporarily stop 
updating, but the numerical 
level counter and the high 
score display both record 
the proper level.

The level symbols then start 
displaying correctly again at 
level 100, and continues to 
display correctly until level 
254.

Level 255 morphs into Level 0. 
Then the game starts over, and 
becomes easy again for level
1.

#Matmania

$icon=matmania
$data
$bio
Tips and Tricks:


First do the usual things in 
the game (a few punches and 
body slams) until you can get 
a pile driver on your
opponent.
Once you get that first pile 
driver, simply pick up your 
opponent and throw him into 
the ropes. Allow him to just 
ram into you - you will both 
go down. Now just pick him up 
and give him another pile 
driver and then throw him 
again into the ropes and allow 
him to ram into you. Just keep 
alternating between pile-
drivers and throwing into the 
ropes and ramming you until 
you feel like pinning him. 
Using this technique I got up 
to match 39 on a quarter, 
playing for over 1 1/2 hours. 
After you throw your opponent, 
you can bend over and throw 
him out of the ring by 
standing in front of him and 
hitting punch. The problem is,
sometimes he will stop and 
beat you down. You can avoid 
this by simply not being in 
front of him. You can be at 
the top of the ring, throw him
into the ropes, and move all 
the way to the bottom of the 
ring. When he gets to the 
position he would normally 
have to be in to throw him 
(right in front of you), hit 
the punch key. He'll teleport 
down to you, and you'll fling 
him out the ring. Works every 
time.

A slight variant: wait until 
he is just about to run PAST 
where he would normally be in 
front of you, and throw him. 
He teleports up to you, but 
then stalls there for about 
1 second. (The windup) You 
will then fling him OUT of 
the caged area! (The pitch).
He comes back in as if it 
never happened, but it looks 
cool. (You have to be on the 
right side of the ring, and
preferably near the top, for 
this to happen.)


Here is a complete Mat Mania 
moves list:


First, basic moves:


Joystick: Move Around

Button 1: Punch (P)

Button 2: Kick (K)
                 
Both Buttons: Run


While Opponent is Standing:


P + K - Dash at opponent.

P (while running) - Shoulder
Block

K (while running) - Flying
Press

To grab the opponent, run into
him.


While holding on to opponent:


P - Irish Whip (Throw
opponent)

K - Pile Driver

P + UP - Body Slam

K + UP - Suplex


After Opponent has been
thrown:


P + Opponent's direction - 
Elbow Smash

P - Back Body Drop

K + Opponent's direction - 
Clothesline

K - Reverse Mule Kick


While Opponent is on the 
ground:


P - Pick up opponent

K - Pin Opponent


While on the Turnbuckle:


P - Knee Drop

K - Sunset Flip


You can do three moves (two in 
later matches [late 30s on])
to 
your opponent before needing 
to ram him with the old 
"faceblock" maneuver. However, 
the moves appear to be broken 
into categories:


Big moves - Piledriver and 
Brainbuster (Suplex)

Medium moves - Clothesline, 
Elbow, Backdrop

Small moves - Body Slam, 
Spinning Kick

Doesn't seem to count - 
Shoulder Block, Flying Body 
Press, Rope Moves


The "count" works as follows. 
Usually you get one of each 
class of move in order from 
big to small. You can always
substitute a lower move for a 
higher one. At certain times 
you will get only medium and 
small, especially the first 
series when facing Karate 
Fighter or Piranha after match 
5. Sometimes you won't be able 
to do three. You can tell 
because your opponent puts up 
a small, ineffective 
resistance to your second
move.


Once per match, you CAN do two 
big moves in a row. My friends 
and I call this the triple, 
because you are guaranteed to
be able to do a third move 
afterward. In the first 5 
matches, the triple is 
generally between 2:30 and 
2:15.

For instance, you can beat 
Coco Savage (and demonstrate 
the triple to yourself) by 
immediately running across 
and Shoulder Blocking him.
Back 
up and repeatedly Shoulder 
Block him until he does not 
get up as quickly (you should 
be standing over him). At this 
point, you can Piledrive him 
(to turn him around), Suplex 
him out of the ring, dive on 
him and run him into the 
fence safely, because that 
move WILL BE YOUR TRIPLE, and 
diving on him doesn't count. 
At this point, faceblock (ram) 
him as he is getting in the 
ring, throw him across and go 
to the very top and backdrop 
him into the corner (don't 
worry he'll teleport up there) 
where you can do your rope 
moves. You can do any other 
move to him first safely
before backdropping him.


Don't be afraid to fight on 
the floor, just be aware of 
the "count" and the fact that 
you can't clear it out there 
without getting trashed. The 
hardest move in the game (and 
one of the coolest) is 
Piledriving your opponent on 
the floor (obviously must be 
your triple and he has to be 
trashed already). 


Miscellaneous notes:


1.You can only climb on the 
turnbuckles in the top-left 
and top-right corners.


2.Running towards the ropes 
and pressing the K button will 
cause you to jump out of the 
ring (should only be done
while an opponent is out 
there).


3.The maximum number of jumps 
off the rope you can do is 
three - any more and the 
opponent will get up 
regardless of the amount of 
damage inflicted.


4.Fight as little as possible 
outside the ring; you run the 
chance of being thrown to the 
other end and facing a ring 
out loss (especially with Coco 
Savage and the Piranha - they 
are dirty fighters!).


5.When an opponent throws you, 
you have the choice of 
pressing P to do a shoulder 
block or K to do a flying 
press. The move you select 
should depend on the
opponent's
reaction - if they throw you 
and run, press K repeatedly to
beat them with the flying 
press. If the opponent is 
standing there, it is almost a 
sure sign that you will be 
receiving one of their 
"stopping moves" (i.e.: Coco's 
Haymaker or Piranha's choke 
hold). For this, press K 
repeatedly. If the opponent
has
not prepared their signature 
stop, this usually means they 
are just going to punch or 
kick you. Pressing P will give 
them a shoulder block and 
knock them down. Try to decide 
on which move you plan on 
doing once you see their 
reaction.


6.If you start to get the 
"upper hand" on your opponent 
(which isn't that hard to do),
throw him into the ropes and
when he bounces back, let him 
collide into you (you should 
be the first one to get up), 
pick him up and do a pile
driver, pick him up, throw him 
into the ropes and let him 
collide into you, pick him up 
and pile drive him again. You 
can do this for as long as 
you like but make sure to pin 
him before the time runs out. 
For a sure pin, just climb the
top rope and land on him three 
times then pin.


7.A change in the music in the 
game indicates you are in 
danger of losing the match! 


Below is a list of opponents, 
their signature moves, 
difficulty and comments about 
them:


Opponent: Insane Warrior

Signature Move: Body Press

Difficulty: Very Easy

Comments: Comic relief for 
the game. A very easy opponent 
to beat up and a good learning 
partner.


Opponent: Karate Fighter

Signature Move: Rabbit Punch

Difficulty: Easy

Comments: Another opponent to 
use as a practice partner.


Opponent: Coco Savage

Signature Move: Slingshot 
(grabs you by the ankles and 
throws you across / out of 
the ring).

Difficulty: Very Difficult

Comments: A dirty fighter. 
Will knock you down by giving 
you a shoulder block or 
knocking you on the head. Will 
cheat by getting you near the 
ropes and giving you plenty 
of shoulder blocks!


Opponent: The Pirhana

Signature Move: Elbow Drop

Difficulty: Moderate

Comments: The dirtiest fighter 
in the game. A very difficult 
opponent to fight with outside 
the ring.


Opponent: Golden Hulk

Signature Move: Leg Drop

Difficulty: Moderate

Comments: The champ. Likes to 
body slam and throw opponents 
out of the ring.

and Brad Fuller


In 1984, Marble Madness was
the first game for the new
Atari
System 1 and Atari Games
demonstrated the technical
superiority of this new piece 
of hardware with this
outstanding
game. 

-It was the first game with
such
impressive Pseudo-3D-Graphics.

-It was the first game with
true 
stereo sound.

-It was the first game with a
kind
of film music, the music
really
supports the pictures and
keeps the
player in suspense.

-It seems to be the first game
that
hardly had any repetitive
elements
during the levels and that had
a real
"end", the player could win
against
the machine.


There often are rumors on the
internet about Marble Madness
2
(Marble Man), a game that was
never released, but that was
tested
in several arcades around
1991.
There were new levels and the
marble had some "Extra
weapons". The marble was
personified in death and win
sequences ("Marble Man" had a
cape and a face) and at least
some of the prototypes had
joysticks instead of
trackballs. 
Nobody ever seems to have
published a screen shot of
this
game, although there are some
pics of the cabinet on some
arcade sites. (Al? Any more 
info?)


Tips and Tricks:


When you play 2 players, the 
winner of each level gets a 
bonus 5 seconds. If your 
opponent can make it as far as 
the silly race, that's an 
extra 25 seconds for the 
ultimate race, not to mention 
a possible extra 10 seconds 
with a wand. The opponent can 
also continue once (with the 
same time as the other
player). 


This doesn't work with 
emulators, but does work in 
the arcade version: In a one 
player game, if you use both 
trackballs (one with each
hand) 
you can move with greater 
control and at considerably 
greater speed. It takes a 
while to get used to, but once 
you do the reward is great. It 
makes finishing the game a 
snap.


This isn't really a trick, but 
some people don't realize it: 
On the practice race, don't 
move when you start, and after 
a few seconds, a ramp will 
appear that will slide away 
the ball.


The practice race has three 
parabolic curves just before 
the goal. They can be used to 
jump on the other side of the 
track, if you have enough 
speed. You will land onto some 
number that will give out a
few 
thousand points.


On the second level (The 
Intermediate Race) each player 
starts out on a platform and 
has to roll down a ramp into a
maze. If you jump off the 
platform at the correct angle, 
you can land on the surface 
between the mazes and roll 
directly to the maze exit. 
Start at the center line of 
the side of the platform 
opposite the ramp, and aim for 
the right edge of the place 
where the platform and ramp 
meet. Reverse this for the 
right player.


On the aerial race, the second 
player has a chance to jump 
onto the first player. At the 
start, you can jump over the 
first curve and land on the 
first player track.

In the Silly Race, near the 
end there is a maze-like area 
where you go up a ramp and
have 
to negotiate several turns and
go down a ramp. The walls of 
the up-ramp are short, and you 
can jump off the ramp and 
around the maze by going up
the ramp, then back down and 
hard left.

At the end of stage 1, a large

inches up from the bottom of 
the cliff, and line up so your 
bullets will hit just to the 
right of the plane's center, 
it cannot hit you with its 
cannon. This takes dedicated

consistently.

Tips and Tricks:


If "Continue Game" is turned 
on, you can keep continuing at 
a higher level each time. 
However, you must gain at 
least one extra man in each 
continued game to continue
that game. This process stops 
when you reach the 300,000 
point mark. At this point, no 
matter how high your score 
gets (i.e. 400,000, 500,000 
etc.), you will NOT be able to 
continue your game at a higher 
score.

Designed and programmed
by Dave Theurer (Tempest)


Originally called Armeggedon,
Missile Command was designed
at a time that the United 
States and Russia were locked
in a fierce "cold war". The 
idea began when Lyle Rains 
received a clipping of a 
magazine story about sat-
ellites. He passed this
article on to Dave Theurer
who then designed the game.
Dave says work on the game
became so intense, he had 
nightmares of impending
nuclear holocaust on a
regular basis.

Missile Command has 2 bugs. At
810,000 you are awarded an
almost unlimited amount of
cities
(I computed it to be 240 at
one
time). After 255 screens, a
screen
is displayed with 0x points.
The actual points awarded on
this screen are 256 times the
normal points. After
completing this screen (and
racking up a lot of points!),
another screen is displayed
with 0x points, but this time,
the level ends as soon as it 
starts with just bonus points
awarded, no screen is actually
played. For each of the 30
missiles left and 6 cities
left,
256 times normal points are
awarded. The screen following
this one starts the game over
at
1x points, a slow first
screen,
but with the score maintained.
The score rolls over after
999,995 points. 


A piezoceramic gas lighter 
could be used to produce a 
electric flash.If you put this 
flash on metal parts of the 
Missile Command cabinet you get, 
after a few flashes, 40 or 99 
credits. This trick worked also 
on a few other arcade machines 
but on Missile Command it worked 
perfect. I wouldn`t recommend to
try out the trick now because it 
may damage the inside electronic.

Tips and Tricks:


When alien ships fly over, 
keep adjusting your speed or 
they will eventually hit you 
with a bomb. Draw their bombs 
to one end of the screen, then 
shift to the other.


The big key to this game is 
memorization. After the 
beginner course, you go on to 
the champion course, which 
never changes no matter how 
many times you pass it. 
Memorize the two courses, and 
you will almost never lose a 
life. 


Although the part of the mines 
seems to be the more
difficult, 
it isn't - all you have to do 
is not move your tank at all, 
only pressing the jump button.

The first of a series
of four Mr. Do games, 
this one was the biggest
success. None of Universal's
games did near as well as Mr
Do, and Universal disappeared 
in the video game crash of 
1983-84.


Tips and Tricks:


It's possible to win 255 lives 
on the first screen, but only 
if an apple appears in the top 
two rows of the playfield. 
Begin by digging a tunnel 
directly from the bottom of 
the screen to just below the 
apple, but leave enough dirt 
under it that it doesn't fall. 
Next, kill all of the enemies 
but one, then lose all of your 
extra lives. As soon as you're 
on your last life, go right 
under the apple and wait. 
Eventually, the remaining 
enemy will come after you. 
Allow the apple to drop, but, 
in the interval before you're 
squashed, kill the enemy with 
the powerball. If all has gone 
well, you'll be carried to the 
bottom of the screen, the
music 
will go haywire for a moment, 
and you'll be awarded 255 
extra lives. Note that you 
should always lose a life 
before spelling 'EXTRA', or 
you'll roll back to zero
lives, 
so, to be safe, immediately 
kill yourself at the start of 
level two.

Steven Zahler reports that, on 
MAME, this trick will only 
work with the Taito version of 
Mr. Do!

Super Piero is the
Japanese version of
this game. The maze
graphics are slightly 
different.


Tips and Tricks:


Try to make concentric circle 
patterns from the outermost 
edge in, "eating" the 
outermost cherries, dots or 
whatever each time. This will 
allow you to get a ton of 
pineapples, which score the 
most, and will get you a good 
score in early stages before 
it gets difficult.

When Midway needed a sequel 
to the greatest selling video
game of all time, Namco was 
not yet ready to deliver it
yet, as Super Pacman was 
still in development. There-
fore, Midway opted to design
the sequel in-house, and Ms.
Pacman was born.


Tips and Tricks:


"I was playing the first 
screen and the aqua ghost was 
heading up at the top of the 
screen. Instead of turning and 
following along the top of 
the screen he continued up 
and off the top and reappeared 
from below." 

It's hard to repeat 
consistently, but this happens 
when you turn him blue while 
he's still inside the center 
box and then eat him right at 
the door. You can turn him 
blue again even though he's 
not following the maze, eat 
him, and have his eyes get 
lost because they don't know 
how to get back to the box. 
MORE COMPLETELY USELESS 
FUN!!!"


The 133th level is the last
"regulation" board. It is
still possible to get
additional boards on the
arcade machine (this seems
random to a large degree).

This is a hack of Ms. Pacman
done by Two-Bit Score, who 
also did Popeye Pacman.


Tips and Tricks:


As in the regular Ms. Pac Man 
game, the maze turns invisible 
at a certain point. However, 
in Ms. Pac Attacks, this point 
is reached much earlier - at 
about the 144th screen 
instead of the 255th.

#NARC

Tips and Tricks:


While coming out of any door, 
move the joystick left. 
IMMEDIATELY after your 
character appears, move the 
joystick up. If you do 
everything correctly, your cop 
will be "stuck" to the wall, 
and will be able to walk on 
the wall to the next stage.

A specific use for the same
trick:

An easy way to get free lives 
is on the first level. Right 
after you leave the subway, 
keep your joystick pointed up. 
If you do this, you will 
"stick" to the wall and nobody 
can touch you, though you can 
arrest tons of people (50 is 
the max). You can do this in 
other levels, though it does 
not seem to be as useful. One 
problem occurs right when you 
get out of the subway. There 
is a barrel which obstructs 
your path in/on the wall. You 
can just rocket it away if 
there are people behind the 
barrel (in respect to you). 
You can stay on the wall all 
the way to the passkey spot 
and into the door.


To get ridiculous numbers of 
points and, thusly, free men, 
you need to get to the end of 
the game, or at least where
Mr.
Big is. Once you've killed him 
(the little one *and* the big 
one), and you get to enter the 
treasure vault, just collect 
all the big gold blocks, and 
just wait. Don't do anything, 
just wait. After a while, the 
machine will send a pack of 
those annoying dogs after you. 
Let them kill you. You'll be 
sent back a stage in the game. 
And you have to fight your way 
back to the next 'bonus' exit 
door... once you do, mega-
points and mega-men.


Note the automatic teller 
machines present in a few 
places. March your character 
up to the machine and push 
into it; it should start 
spitting out money (evidence). 
Not HUGELY useful, but it's 
still kind of neat.

Tips and Tricks:


Occasionally when you lose
your 
last life, instead of getting 
the "GAME OVER" screen you'll 
get a message something like
this: "Welcome to Heaven"

There are three different 
heaven rounds, depending on 
the level you end on, one 
each for Rounds 4-6. The 
trick is to "get out" of 
Heaven - if you reach the 
Virgin Mary, the game ends. 
There's a secret exit out of 
each Heaven. Some are harder
to find than others. Once you 
get out, your game will 
continue as normal.

You only enter Heaven if you 
are on level 3-1 or later, and 
only if you are killed by a 
projectile weapon (rock, 
boomerang, laser, etc.) Also, 
you can only enter heaven once 
per game. Having escaped once, 
you go to hell instead (game 
over). If you are killed by a 
contact killer enemy, or by a 
spike of any sort, or by fire 
of any sort, you do not go to 
heaven. Getting killed by the 
hurry-up devil also will 
guarantee you don't go to 
heaven.

Tips and Tricks:


On the first stage, there is a
popcorn stand (or whatever you 
want to call it) at the end of 
the walking stage, right 
before you get onto the bars 
which you have to cross to get 
to the sumo wrestler at the 
end. This is somewhat
difficult 
for beginners, because the 
bars are kind of tough.
However, 
there is a leap of faith you 
can take to avoid the bars 
entirely.
Do not destroy the popcorn 
machine. Kill all the enemies, 
then hop on top of it. Pull 
down until you are on the 
lower half of it (this is just 
to insure that the people on 
the bars can't hit you). Now, 
walk forward until the 
machine takes control (there
is
a point at which, if you let
go
of the joystick, you continue 
walking forward. This is what 
you are trying to do).  Note 
that you don't fall when you 
walk off the popcorn machine. 
Neat, huh? Do NOT jump at 
this point. A vertical jump is
suicide. Normal forward jumps 
might be safe, but I make no 
guarantees. When you finally 
float within range of the 
final level, you can get off 
by jumping straight up, or by 
moving down on the screen 
until you 'fall off' of the 
popcorn machine.

Pacman was conceived at 
lunchtime...literally. The
designer was very hungry, and
ordered a whole pizza for 
himself. He took one slice, 
and Pacman was born.


The name Pacman is derived
from the Japanese slang word
"paku-paku", which means "to
eat". The game was called
"Puckman" in Japan, but due to
American's predilection with
changing words to vulgarities
by scratching part of the word
off (Puck to...well, you
know),
it was changed to Pacman.


To give the game some tension,
some clever AI was programmed 
into the game. The ghosts 
would group up, attack the
player, then disperse. Each
ghost had its own AI. Blinky
chases Pacman, Pinky is pos-
itioned a few dots in front
of Pacman's mouth. The others
move randomly.


The game took 1 1/2 years to
complete, and had five people
on its team.


Pacman is the greatest
selling arcade game of all
time, and is arguably the
most well-known video char-
acter. It had its own
cartoon, lunch box, board
game, and hundreds of other
products. Pacman was also
the first game to have a
"character", and changed
the face video games for-
ever. 


Pacman was the first 
video game to be as equally 
popular to women as it was
with men.

Pac-Man patterns: available

(original pattern pages 
contributed by yours truly-

Idle trick: Need a breather? 
Just park yourself in the spot 
immediately and to the right 
of where you start, and make 
sure that no monsters are 
"looking" at you when you do 
it. The monsters will run all 
over the maze, but they'll 
never find you. Go to the 
bathroom in peace.


After the 255th level, Pac-Man 
locks up with an interesting 
split-screen effect. This 
lockup does not occur if, at 
the end of level 254, the 
number "255" appears at any 
point within your score.

#Pac Land
$info=pacland,pacland2,pacland

$data
$bio
Tips and Tricks:


Pushing Fire Hydrants, Cactus, 
or Tree Stumps the opposite 
direction you are going will 
give you surprises like a 
Helmet, Invincibility, or 
sometimes a warp! To push an 
item, jump over it, turn 
around, and run into it at 
full speed. Keep running, and 
it will be pushed to the left. 
Some objects can also be 
pushed to the right.

A good example of this is on 
the first set of trees you 
come to after the start. You 
will see a cherry floating 
above your head as you enter 
the woods. Keep running past 
it until you come to a tree 
stump and keep running as 
though you're trying to push 
the stump to the right. Wait 
until the cherry floats just 
past your head then 
continuously hit run and jump 
so that you collect the cherry
plus all the others that 
appear in sequence. Now jump 
over the next tree stump and 
"push" it backwards. You'll 
get a massive score bonus 
(100,000 ?) and get warped 
forward a few levels.

Another example: On the 4th 
level of every trip (with the 
Fairy Shoes) pushing back an 
item will bring out a bunch 
of balloons. One of them is 
worth 7650 and the rest are 
only 100.


Use the Helmet to block the 
little ghosts dropped from 
airplanes and Inky and you'll 
get 300 points for each one. 
Also, if you are in an area 
with airplanes and a Power 
Pellet is nearby, wait until 
a little ghost or 2 are 
dropped and grab the Power 
Pellet and eat little ghosts 
as they are falling (this is 
tough to do). Any ghost you 
eat after the 5th is worth 
7650 points!


Try to collect the "power 
pills" when as many ghosts as 
possible are on screen so 
that you can kill all four 
that move around plus the one 
that constantly "trails" you. 
If you manage to get all four 
plus the "trailing" one LAST, 
a small pacman with the letter 
"L" appears. Jump and catch it 
to get a bonus for the amount 
of time you have remaining, 
and your time reset to full.


You can receive bonus points 
by jumping at a particular 
place at the end of each
level. 
The points received are 
relevant to the vertical 
position of your character 
when the level finishes. This 
works at the end of every 
stage, not just where there 
is a church, e.g. the return 
journey to your "family". The
maximum score for being just 
short of landing is 7650. To 
achieve this, if you are near 
a church, jump when the center 
of your head is horizontally 
level with the rear "wall" of 
the church.

On Monday, June 30, 1986; Mr.
Mark Caesar and Mr. Robin
Hallingstad file a suit
against Atari
Games Corp. for $1 million
plus
profits alleging that the
company
stole the idea for a video
game
that was marketed by the name
of PAPERBOY. The boys had
submitted to Atari a detailed
proposal for a similar game in
July 1983. 

(Don Thomas, www.icwhen.com) 


An early ROM version of this
game had a bug which allowed
the player to ride the bike
further than the obstacle
course, causing the machine
to crash.


Tips and Tricks:


In the race at the end of the 
day, the end of it has a 
stadium with an audience, and 
a lawn with a fence on it. 
There's a bit of grass on the 
right side of the fence. If 
you steer your bike onto the 
grass, the bike will *not* 
stop! It keeps going. Do it 
once more, then finish the 
normal way. Your score will 
get really high. 

Here's another, more detailed 
view of the same technique:

You are able to score millions 
by going through the training 
course without hitting
anything
(with papers) and then riding
through the area between the
finish line and the fence.
This 
doesn't award the points right 
away. You still have to go on 
through the parking lot (which
then messes up the whole 
screen - lots of added shapes, 
and color blocks not really 
corresponding to anything). 
Then if you keep going (with 
your bike moving very slow 
toward the right side of 
screen) the game will loop 
you back to the training 
course again. This is where 
you get 1 million points (or 
enough to make the high score 
run into the standing number 
(i.e. 1-10). The training 
course is the same but this 
time the screen is really 
messed up. Only the main 
obstacles are shown (i.e. any 
moving objects), but the 
background is totally screwed. 
You only can get the machine
to
do two separate first runs 
(i.e. once through the 
training course for a million) 
or 1 single 10 million run 
(twice through), but after 
that it won't let you do it
again for the rest of that 
credit. This works on most 
Paperboy machines, but not 
all.


After a score of 10,000,000 or 
more is achieved, the initial 
in the top 10 ranking merges 
with the score to produce a 
truly impressive score
display. 
For example, if you had top 
score at 10,000,000, this 
would appear as "110,000,000"!

Tips and Tricks:


The highest point values in 
this game are for grabbing 
bonus items and finishing 
mazes. Go for bonus items as 
quickly as possible, because 
they vanish if not collected 
within a certain amount of 
time.


If threatened, don't hesitate 
to leave whatever maze you're 
working on and start another 
one. One of the nice things 
about this game is that you're 
working on four mazes at once, 
and they can be finished in 
any order. Don't feel 
obligated to finish one before 
starting another.


If the thing that unzips your 
trail enters the maze, it is 
generally best to leave and 
come back later, though taking 
a pitchfork will freeze him
for 
a while.

Easter Egg:
(IRECSA - G.G.I. Corp 
version only)

On the first level, with the
birds in a doughnut shape,
shoot the first two birds
from the left-hand side, be
as quick as you can. Then
move your ship as far to
the left as you can and
wait for about 10-15
seconds. Three birds will
fly around then go back to
the formation, which
should then all move.
Three more birds will fly
around with one going off
the left hand side of the
screen, come under and
hit your ship. A beeping
noise is heard and you
should have over 100,000
points and 5 lives. If it
doesn't work first time,
keep trying. 

(Forgot who sent this in.
Email me!)


Tips and Tricks:


During the game three birds 
will attack all in a line. Let 
those birds fly all the way to 
the bottom and start to fly 
back up. As they are flying
up, 
shoot all three in a row real 
quick (2 or 3 seconds) and you 
will get 200,000 points 
instead of 200.

Tips and Tricks:


In the third round (the one 
with the nonmoving ship in the 
middle of the screen), shoot 
the "engine flare" out as its 
door opens to advance the 
bonus multiplier. Each 
extinguished flare doubles the 
bonus. It's hard to shoot out 
all five, as the last door is 
only open for a split second. 
Make sure you don't kill all 
fliers until all possible 
flares have been extinguished!

In the later rounds, this 
bonus can give you 9600+ 
points if fully used. (It 
seems like it went up to 12000 
points or so in the later 
rounds, but it's been a long 
time.) 


For easy points, in the second 
round (the one with the flying 
"birds"), kill all but one of 
the "birds" and shoot it in 
the edge of its wing. It will 
hover for a moment and then 
drop suddenly. Repeat when it 
appears at the top again. 
Eventually the bird will drop 
too fast to continue this, but 
in the meantime, each hit 
gives you 20 points, and it's 
possible to rack up 1000+ 
points before it starts 
dropping too quickly. Super-
advanced players can do this 
with two birds at once.

Tips and Tricks:


This guide, written by Robert 
Guerra, originally appeared in 
the August / September 1983 
issue of Video Games Player 
magazine.


"Beat It! Popeye [arcade]"


"With Popeye, Nintendo has 
combined the cute characters, 
simple storyline, and good-
natured violence of a Saturday 
morning cartoon with smooth 
animation and exciting game 
play, to create a challenging 
contest. The object is to help 
Popeye win Olive Oyl's love by 
catching hearts, musical notes
and H.E.L.P. letters which she 
tosses from the top of the 
screen. Just to make things 
interesting, Popeye is 
harassed by his old nemesis, 
Brutus. 
Other dangers in this triple-
screen game include bottle-
throwing Sea Hags, a deadly 
buzzard, and small white 
skulls. One thing Popeye has 
going for him, however, is his 
trusty can of spinach. You're 
allotted one can per screen, 
and once eaten, it gives 
Popeye about ten seconds of: 
"muskles." During this time, 
he can knock Brutus for a 
loop, and most point values 
are doubled.
You control Popeye with a 
four-direction joystick and a 
punch button. On each of the 
game's screens, you are 
required to move Popeye up 
and down stairs and ladders 
in order to catch the slowly 
falling objects. Most gamers
should find this considerably 
easier than climbing the 
ladders in Donkey Kong, where 
exact positioning directly 
above or below the ladders is 
crucial. In addition to 
knocking Brutus off the
screen,
the punch button is used to 
defend Popeye against flying 
bottles, and to K.O. buzzards 
on the third screen.


Scoring


When Popeye catches an object, 
its point value is determined 
by which of the screen's four 
levels he's on. Hearts, notes, 
and letters caught at the top 
of a screen are worth 500 
points, 300 on the third
level,
100 on the second level, and 
50 points on the lowest level, 
When Popeye is under the 
influence of spinach, all 
these values are doubled. You 
can also acquire points by 
breaking bottles (100), 
punching the buzzard(l000), 
crowning Brutus with a bucket 
(2000), or by sending Brutus 
flying off into the water 
(3000). Be sure to eat your 
spinach before attempting this 
one. 


Screen One
   

To complete this screen, 
Popeye must catch twenty-four 
hearts. You can keep track of 
the number caught by checking 
the side of Popeye's house in 
the top left corner of the 
screen. In the top right 
corner is Olive's house, which 
displays the number of lives 
left and the round you're in. 
When the game begins, Popeye 
will be on the left portion 
of the highest level. Brutus 
will be on the level below, on 
the right side of the screen. 
Wait in this position until 
Brutus crosses over to the 
left. When he's almost 
directly below Popeye, move 
left. This will "wrap" you 
around to the right side of 
the screen. (This is the only 
level where you can wrap). At 
this point, Brutus will 
descend the stairs to level 
two, where he will move to the
center and stop. Quickly move 
to the left edge of the 
platform and punch the speed 
bag. This will slide it across 
into the bucket in the center 
of the screen, knocking it 
down two levels, and onto 
Brutus's head to start the 
game off with 2000 points.
While Brutus is trying to get 
the bucket off his head, you 
can catch the hearts that
Olive 
Oyl has been throwing, by 
jumping down to level three. 
(Unlike cousin Mario, Popeye 
can't lose a life by falling 
from one level to the next.) 
After catching the first 
heart, be ready to punch the 
bottles whichm will be thrown 
by the Sea Hag emerging from 
the right. To break all of the 
bottles, face right and punch 
like crazy. The bottles are 
deadly.
Continue catching hearts on 
the third level while 
occasionally running upstairs 
to avoid Brutus. He'll never 
follow you up to the fourth 
level, but if directly below, 
he'll jump up and try to knock 
Popeye to his death.
Once hearts begin flowing 
down below level three, 
you'll have to go down after 
them. This is a good time to 
head for the spinach, which 
is by the stairs on the left 
side of the second or third 
levels. Time your arrival 
carefully, because the can 
alternates between the two 
levels every five seconds. 
When you reach the spinach 
(use the punch button) 
Popeye will turn red and 
Brutus will take off.
If both Popeye and Brutus are 
on level three, Brutus will go 
down to level two. Simply head 
him off by taking the ladder 
in the center of the screen. 
If you eat the spinach on 
level two, go up the stairs 
to level three and try the
same
tactic. When you punch Brutus, 
you'll be awarded 3000 points 
and the screen will shake. 
While Brutus is out of 
commission, clean up the
hearts 
at the lowest level of that 
screen, working your way up 
to the higher, more valuable 
levels.
If a heart should reach the 
bottom before Popeye catches 
it, you'll have eight seconds 
to get to it before it sinks 
into the sea. Never stop 
directly above or below 
Brutus. He's got a reach you 
wouldn't believe.


Screen Two                 


Popeye's detail is to catch 
sixteen red sixteenth-notes 
which Olive tosses from the 
top right side of the screen. 
As on screen one, Popeye will
begin on the left side of the 
screen on level four. Level 
three has a gap in the center 
which Brutus can cross. 
Popeye can't cross this gap 
without falling a level, but 
he can wrap on this level. 
Move Popeye down the ladder 
to level three. Brutus will be 
across the gap. Move Popeye 
back and forth quickly in one 
spot until Brutus crosses over 
to the left side. At this 
point, wrap to the right side 
of the screen and catch your 
first two notes. Since Brutus 
can't wrap around after you, 
he'll be forced to cross back 
over to the right side to get 
you. If you stop moving, 
Brutus will throw four bottles 
Popeye's way before crossing 
over. To prevent this, simply 
move back and forth quickly 
again. When Brutus crosses 
the gap again, wrap to the 
left. Continue with this 
tactic until a note slips by 
the third level. As in round 
one, this is a great time for 
spinach. This time the can 
alternates between the 
stairways on the right of the 
second and first levels. Be 
sure to get it on level two. 
After you reach the spinach, 
head immediately up the stairs 
to level three. Wrap through 
to the left side of the 
screen and keep going. You'll 
either catch Brutus before the 
gap, or he'll cross over to 
the right side while Popeye 
falls to the second level. 
Don't worry. Continue to the 
right and catch Brutus coming 
down the stairs. Use the same 
procedure for cleaning up the 
remaining notes as you did for 
the hearts in round one. One 
difference in round two is 
Brutus's ability to jump from 
one level to the level below. 
Another is Wimpy's springboard 
in the lower left of the 
screen. Popeye can escape from 
level two by simply running 
off the left side and jumping 
onto the spring board. When 
Wimpy lands, he'll send 
Popeye flying to safety. Never 
use the springboard to escape 
bottles coming at Popeye from 
the right side. It will 
catapult him right into the 
line of fire. Brutus can use 
the springboard too.


Screen Three


In addition to Brutus and the 
Hags, now you have the pesky 
Buzzard to contend with. While 
avoiding these dangers, Popeye 
must catch the letters H, E, 
L, and P which float from 
Olive's mouth as she screams 
from the crow's nest of the 
ship you're now on. There's no 
way to wrap on this screen, 
and every level except the 
first has a gap near the 
center. About the only things 
Popeye has going for him are 
his spinach (kept on the right
again), and a small sliding 
platform bridging the gap on 
level four. Popeye is on the 
left of level four. 
Immediately turn him left and 
punch out the buzzard for 1000
points. Then run onto the 
sliding platform to avoid 
Brutus. When he closes in, or 
a lot of letters start getting 
by, it's spinach time. Because 
of the structure of the
screen, 
you'll probably have to head 
for the top of the screen and 
then drop down on Brutus 
through a gap. If you know you 
won't be able to catch him, 
make a beeline for the 
letters.
The remainder of the round
will 
seem to last forever, 
especially when you realize 
that Brutus can now jump down 
two levels. Get the ol' seadog 
through this one all right,
and 
he finally gets the girl.
Watch 
for a Parker Brothers home 
video game of Popeye on sale 
in July."
 

Minimum Score Potential: 
45,000


Here's an interesting display 
glitch: On the musical note 
level, you can stand at the 
point on the edge where you 
"wraparound" and if you punch
a bottle in the right spot, 
it'll erase part of the "THRU" 
sign. This can be done on both 
sides.

#Punchout

Tips and Tricks:


Here's the system for getting
by everyone in one round of
Punch Out.


Warning: This system works on
9 out of ten Punch Out
machines. I have seen some
where the first level is
unusually hard and the latter
couple of techniques don't
work.


Glass Joe: So easy that you'd
have to be trying not to win.
But to be 100% sure.. Keep
guard up till his eyes glow
for a big punch, dodge, and
hammer him with rights and
lefts to the face. Repeat till
down.


Piston Hurricane: Concentrate
blows, especially lefts, to
the abdomen. When he backs up
and charges in, hit him with a
blow to the stomach as soon as
he charges into you, he'll go
down for the count after the
2nd or third time.


Bald Bull: Fairly simple:
Right, dodge, left left.
Right, dodge left left. Look
out for his upper cuts though
(get out of the way! duh) and
upon his bull-charge you have
two options. A hit to the
stomach when he is right under
you puts him down for the
count, but if your reflexes
aren't optimum, you are better
off at dodging and continuing
the fight. Right to the face
(or 2 lefts), dodge, right. NO
BODY BLOWS TO BALD BULL except
on the bull charge.


Kid Quick: Soooo easy: Right,
dodge, right right dodge right
right dodge right right dodge
right right dodge right right.
(these all being blows to the
head). VERY EASY as long as
you don't lose your rhythm. If
ya do get messed up you can
usually recover with a dodge
and starting again. No blows
to the stomach. This is
basically what you'll be doing
against Mr. Sandman.


Pizza Pasta: Basically you're
waiting for him to screw up.
Use the kid quick system till
he backs off (with the Come
on! Come on!) and DODGE his
hook. Then pummel him with
rights and lefts to the head(
ONLY the head), and he won't
be
fighting back. Repeat till
he's dead. If he pins you up
against the ropes with shots
to the stomach at some point,
just get your guard down there
and sneak in some lefts and
you should break free.


Mr. Sandman, The Champion: Kid
Quick system exactly. Every
now and then however he fires
a very quick left or right to
the head. When he hits you
with one, dodge the opposite
way of the hit quickly or
you'll be going down. 


If you look carefully you can
see Donkey Kong sitting in the
crowd behind the corner of the
ring.

Hardware planned by "Lovely"

japanese TV movies]
"Lonely" Kazuhiro

Character designed by
"Italiano"
Taeko "Donchi" Naoko

Music composed by Cheabow 


A little game which had not a
huge success, but nevertheless
was a "cult game" for many
players thanks to the
brilliant
gameplay, hard-to-find secret
bonuses and anime-like plot.
The inspiration for the five
ESPers design comes from
several japanese cartoons of
the '70s where the physical
aspect of main characters
was strongly stereotyped to
suit their psychological
profile/fighting ability.


Tips and Tricks:


Here is some information about
secret bonuses in Psychic 5:


There is a secret bonus in
every round. To get them, you
must hit the right [?]
(question mark box) when your
score fits a
certain qualification.


The first level "secret" is
near the first phone. You
should jump on the wall
between the two bowls, then
jump up and to
the left. You'll land near a
[?]. If you are in the right
place, a walking clock should
appear within 2/3 seconds. You
can get
a secret bonus from this box
if you hit it when the
thousands digit of your score
is zero. (e.g.: 00000, 10500,
20900). The
first secret is worth 10000
pts.


The second level "secret" is
near the first phone (yes,
like the first one). There are
2 [?]'s on the lower-left
corner of your
screen (when you are near the
phone); the upper one is a
"normal" [?], but you have to
destroy it in order to reach
the
other one. You can get the
secret bonus by hitting it
when the thousands digit of
your score is 1. This is worth
50000 pts.


The third one is near a phone,
again, and near the fishbowl
too. When you can reach the
upper-right corner of the
screen, and 2 umbrellas are
floating above you, THAT is
the right phone. There is also
an extra bonus somewhere near
that. You should use the short
boy or the little girl to
reach the secret bonus - it's
at the end of the "small
corridor" where
the other 2 guys (the tall one
and the fat one) can't enter.
To get it you should hit the
[?] when the thousands digit
is 2.
This should be worth 100000
pts.


I can't remember where the
other "secrets" are. I think
you can get them when the
thousands digit of your score
is the
same as the number of the
round minus 1. (e.g.: 6 for
the 7th, 4 for the 5th...) I'm
not really sure, but I *seem*
to remember
it was something like that.
[Can anyone provide more info?
--Roger]


The "ALL GOLD" bonus. Very
simple to explain, but hard to
do: When you break a bowl, the
item you find in it is the
same as the previous bowl, if
you don't use your hammer
after you hit the first and
before the second. If you do,
instead,
the item "shifts", and you
find the "next" in the order.
If you go on hammering, the
"rotation" can bring the first
item back
again. The first level has 4
items, so if you "shoot"
0/4/8/12/16... times after
breaking the first bowl, you
find the same item
in the second one. This is
true unless you already
"finished" an item, otherwise
you should "shoot"
0/3/6/9/12... times to
find the item twice.

Inspired by artwork by M.C.
Escher who was an artist that
Jeff admired. Ron Waxman
came up with the idea of
Q*Bert changing the color of
the cubes. Q*Bert's name
originated by the combination
of cube and Hubert, but the
"Cube-Bert" was changed to
"Q-Bert" to make it more
unique. The concept game
was called "Snots and Boogers"
and then "@!#?@!" (which
many of the programmers and
Gottlieb VPs said would be
impossible to get anyone to
say)
before the final version was
called just "Q*Bert". Slick
and
Sam were a play on the phrase
"spick and span" with Sam
being
named after co-worker Sam
Russo. Rick Tighe came up with
the idea of adding the pinball
hardware which generated the
very mechanical KA-CHUNK
when Q*Bert falls off the
pyramid.


Tips and Tricks:


Some general tips for Q*bert:

Good results can be obtained
by working your way down one
end of the level at the start,
moving across the bottom to
the other side, catching a
disk to the top, and then
filling in the middle squares.

A big part of the game is
waiting to see where creatures
are going to jump. You need to
make sure you always time a
jump at the same time the
creatures jump to you can
always have a clear path to a
new square.


After level 9, the levels
repeat themselves.

One of the few American Taito
designs, Qix initially did
big numbers, but quickly
died when players discovered
the machine was "unbeatable."
Having a googolplex of
possible combinations, there
was no singular pattern to
the game, and players lost
interest.


Some tips from "Alienation":


Where we've played it was 
very popular because we found
a way to play it forever and 
with nice hi-scores, as 
follows:


1. first, go up and make 3 
rectangular "doors" at the top 
where the "spiders" appears,
more or less - like this:


------------------------------
|  |  |________________|  |  |
|  |______________________|  |
|____________________________|


This will make new spiders to 
loop in this doors forever.


2. Then isolate the "qix" in 
half a screen (up or down) by 
dividing the screen.


----------------
|              |
|   *-> quix   |
|_____________ |
|              |
|              |
|______________|


3. then make on the other side 
little constructions like this:


 _
| |
|_|_
  | |
  | |
  |_|_
    | |
    |_|


At the points common to each 
block you can then pass 
directly to he other side, 
while the spiders have to go 
around. The blocks can be 
shaped and tall as the player 
whiches, but keep them thin.

If you keep doing this, after 
a while the level will end 
closing with 99% !!!!!!!!!!! 
And with the color you were 
using to make the last
block. (it seems the qix is 
closed in the block you just 
made).

This is probably a bug in the 
program...

Some times it takes a long 
time to close but this works 
almost every time.

or, as the spiders never come 
out, (apart from the first 
two) you can just keep playing 
and (as I did often) just make 
some drawings!!!

After some levels, the qix 
get's very fast and nasty, so 
it becomes very difficult to 
repeat this procedure forever.

This game ends with a
congratulatory screen and 
a free T-shirt offer!  After
entering your initials and
your birthday, you are given a
special code and instructions
to send this info along with
your name, address, shirt
size, etc. to Atari Games. I
doubt they still honor this
offer today though!! =o)


Tips and Tricks:


If you crash your car into one
of the turrets at the side of
the road, you'll get 8-10x the
current value of a turret.
When your
score multiplier is up to 10,
this is 16-20,000 points!
Early on, keep your score
multiplier high and always
crash into at least
two of these babies every
board, and finishing the game
(or doing very well at it) is
not tough. After a while it
gets hard to
crash into two turrets every
board and still finish the
board on time.


Tip for strategies on level 49
and 50: Since level 50 is the
last level, and the game gives
you a complete recharge at the
end of 49, accuracy doesn't
count any more. Just keep
firing as fast as possible.
						  

Run into a "live" roadside
tower (e.g. one that you
haven't shot). It will run up
your score like 20k points.
(Actually, the
points vary; I haven't tried
to reverse engineer the
algorithm).

#RoboCop
$info=robocop,robocopp
$icon=robocop
$data
$bio
Tips and Tricks:


The following cheat for
RoboCop can earn
(theoretically) infinite
scores. There exists a level
in the game (the Junkyard, I
think), where there is an
elevator. If I remember
correctly, it's just after you
get the Cobra gun. Anyway, you
get on the
elevator and ride to the top.
When the elevator reaches the
top, DON'T MOVE! Your score
will suddenly start to
increase,
and will continue to do so
until you step off the
elevator.


Bad guys come onto the screen
when you pass a certain pixel.
Move back and kill them off.
Don't charge through the
game. Learn the bad guy
patterns (they are the same
from game to game


Here are some
cheats/strategies by level:


Level 1: The motorbike which
damages you before you draw
your gun can be beaten by
jumping just before it
comes on the screen. A shop
window has a small menu type
poster in it; jump around
about there. When you land,
punch the bike (it flashes
green and doesn't damage you).
Punch it when it returns to
kill it.


When fighting the ED209, time
your jumps to when it fires at
you (hence jumping over its
shots). When it moves to
the left third of the screen,
stand close to it. The weapons
arm will now point at a
steeper angle (more into the
ground). Now move away
slightly and jump away when
ED209 fires. Its shots will go
into the ground and not trap
you at the left edge of the
screen.


Another approach:

To defeat the ED-209 almost
instantaneously on the first
stage do this: Make sure you
still have the 3-Way gun (not
necessary but makes it quicker
and easier) then as soon as
you clear the area of enemies
the music will change
and the ED-209 will growl.
Simply walk (QUICKLY!) to the
right side of the screen
(Before ED-209 enters) and
fire like
a madman diagonally up and
right. If done correctly, the
ED-209 will come out already
defeated and run away
without so much as scratching
you.


Level 2: To get extra health,
shoot the fat guy using a girl
as a shield. He moves forward
to shoot at you - shoot him
then.

Target practice: Getting all
of the targets (100% hit)
gives *extra* capacity for
your energy bar.

Bug: Missing one target
sometimes still gives 100%,
but don't rely on it!)


Level 3: Go over the top of
the car crushers, and pick up
the baby food. Try and save
the Cobra assault cannon for
the end of the level - this
makes it really easy ! If you
shoot just under the cab of
the final enemy, you can kill
the
guy throwing grenades at you.


Level 3 (Alternate): Get the
cobra cannon, clean all the
enemies at the elevator, the
raise the elevator until the
cobra cannon is slightly
higher than ground level
(about 1/4 inch or less), fire
ONCE to the right and watch
your
score soar! Don't move or your
score will stop. Also, this
only works on the bootleg
board - the original did not
do
this, probably due to a bug.
(At the far right, just
outside of the screen, are
some boxes and the machine
thinks you
hit them but doesn't destroy
them.)


Level 4: Shoot the metal
crushers with the Cobra
cannon, or punch the fire
button like crazy if you get
trapped. The
final bad guy is a crane which
swings a steel ball on an
extendible chain. Don't shoot
the wooden box!! Stand on
it and shoot the cab of the
crane. Also try to save the
Cobra cannon (by punching bad
guys instead of shooting
them) and use it on the crane.


Level 5: Don't charge through
this level, especially on the
conveyor belt. Mind the first
guy armed with a flame
thrower - you can shoot him
before he shoots at you.


The military ED209 at the end
of the level can be beaten by
crouching under the OCP logo
when it charges. Jump
and shoot the weapon arm when
it retreats.


Level 6: Need to move through
this level fairly quickly
(time is a little tight). The
walking coffee tables can be
shot
from the level below, and
careful diagonal shooting can
destroy laser emplacements one
level up. Concentrate on
laser turrets which are
diagonally away from you -
their fire is hardest to
dodge. The last baby food on
the level
gives *all* your energy back.
Try and keep the laser shots
until the end of the level.
When you reach the top level,
move as far to the right as
possible and shoot the
military ED209 as much as
possible before it wakes up.
There is a
fairly safe(ish) position just
at the end of the military
ED209's forward walk (like the
end of level 5, but no OCP
marker). Kill the military
ED209 first. Tactics for the
other ED209 are similar to
level 1.


Level 7: Use diagonal shooting
to destroy laser turrets one
level up. (see also level 6
comment).

The baby food stored in the
box gives all your energy
back. When you reach the
single lift which goes up
multiple
floors, the best way to avoid
being trapped on it by laser
fire is to *jump* onto the
next level just before the
lift
reaches it. Timing between the
laser shots is critical.

When this lift reaches the
top, stop just short of the
floor (you should be able to
see/hear the light curtains
and laser
turrets) and then go back down
as far as you can. The laser
turrets and curtains sometimes
disappear.

The final ED209 can be
destroyed by standing at the
far left of the screen and
jumping up and down. Missiles
launched at you can be
destroyed by shooting or
punching. When the ED209 gets
too close, use the tactic of
level
one.

When ED209 is destroyed, kill
Dick Jones (in the same way as
a gunman holding a hostage is
killed). The president
is not killed by your gun
shots (!)

Designed and programmed
by Eugene Jarvis
and Larry DeMar (Vidkidz)


The design of Robotron was
influenced by Berzerk and the
Commodore PET game Chase.
It's original concept name was
"Robot Wars: 1984."


The prototype of the game was
built on a Defender platform
with a Stargate board and two
Atari 2600 joysticks attached
to a pail. Jarvis came up 
with the control design after
breaking his hand in an auto-
mobile accident. 


Williams is sued by Walt
Disney Productions for
copyright and patent
infringement regarding
Williams use of "tron" in
Robotron. Williams wins the
suit and Walt Disney releases
Tron on time.


Tips and Tricks:


Robotron Name Trick :


1. Fire up while moving right
and press Player 1 button
2. Fire down while moving up
and press Player 2 button
3. Move down while firing up

Trick must be done during game
play. The designer's names
will appear and stay on the
screen until the right
joystick is released from the
up position. Your game is
over(!) once you've done this
trick.


Get points and extra men :


This will get you lots of
points and extra men but at a
VERY slow pace. This is good
if you are going for that 200
million game and want to let
someone hold the game for you
while you take a break or a
nap. On any 5th stage ( the
ones with the brain guys )
shoot everything but 1 or 2
brains. Try and get them to
follow you to the top right
side of the screen. While
touching the right side of the
screen move all the way to the
bottom. Keep shooting up. The
Brains can't move all the way
to the right so you can't hit
them but there snake shot will
move to the right and you will
hit that. The brains will just
sit there and walk right not
down. So you can stay there
for ever and shoot the snake
shots. But you only get 25
points (I think) per shot.
This is also good if you want
to get a 9,999,975 score, if
you are close just get to that
screen and reach the top.
Watch out for the stray shot
that goes to the left, you may
have to move left quick to
kill it.


On the tank levels: If you
need a quick break during the
game, leave one tank. Let it
fire about 20 shots - do not
shoot. At this point it will
stop firing, and you can rest
until you're ready to go on.
This should work during all
tank levels.

#Rolling Thunder
$info=rthunder,rthunderb

$data

Tips and Tricks:


First of all, something that
some people don't know is the
fact that you can visit the
ammo rooms MORE THAN ONCE! The
trick is, after having stocked
up on your bullets from a
particular room (for example,
a MachineGunBullets room), go
forward past the door
approximately the distance of
two jumps, then turn back,
visit the room again, and find
more
ammo. (The reason this works
is because the game is divided
into invisible "sections".
Once you cross a section
boundary, the game forgets
everything from the previous
section.) This is especially
useful on levels 2 and 7,
where,
when combined with another
trick which will be detailed
after this one, one is able to
get MG Bullets up to the 900s
(I
think it resets to zero at
1000). Anyway, there's this
section near the beginning of
levels 2 and 7 where there are
two
platforms next to each other
and above you, the first of
which has a MG Bullets door.
Having killed everyone up to
that
point, kill the guards on the
platforms, fill up with
bullets, then - you just
exited the MG ammo door on the
left side of the
left platform - walk right,
and then jump (while walking)
such that you fall through the
gap between the two platforms
(while still drifting to the
right), then either walk or
jump one more jump-distance to
the right, walk back left,
jump up
onto the right platform, jump
from there onto the left
platform, get more MG bullets,
and repeat about 7 or 8 times
(or less,
if you're not quite sure you
can do the rest of the level
with such limited remaining
time). The thing with the jump
down
through the platform-gap is
that since you're drifting to
the right as you're falling,
it's quicker than jumping
straight down
from the platform, then
walking to the right. But
getting a whole buncha MG
bullets is really useful,
especially on level 7,
what with the seriously
time-limited level 8 being
next, and the fact that level
10 is so much easier with the
MG ammo.
There's a trick to levels 5
and 10 also, but let me first
finish up with 2 and 7.


The other trick on levels 2
and 7 is on the second half of
the level (i.e. past the
stacked boxes, and the gap),
and has to do
with the stairs. If the stairs
always bothered you as being
really slow to traverse, you
can, via a programming glitch,
skip
most of them! What you do is
go down the first set of
stairs until you're on the
left side of the screen (I
think after the
boxes and the gap you just
have to go down a flight to
the right edge, then down some
more to the left edge). Then,
stand on top of the landing
that's just before you reach
the floor. Inch towards the
left edge of it until you're
standing on
the left edge. And then, walk
left, falling off the landing,
then as soon as your feet
leave the landing, go right.
You'll fall
right through the floor
(skipping the stairs), landing
on the same landing one floor
down. Repeat until you reach
the
bottom. With practice, it'll
come really smoothly and
instinctively. Once you get
this down really well, time
how long it
takes you to get from the
platform MG ammo room at the
beginning of the level to the
end of the level using this
majorly-time-saving trick, so
you can figure out when you
should stop getting more ammo
so you can safely finish the
rest
of the level on time. One note
about this particular trick is
that on level 7, the first (I
think) landing, you probably
don't
want to do this trick, because
one of those white guys (that
take four shots to kill) will
appear almost on top of you
when
you land. But otherwise, it
works exactly the same.


And lastly, the most
impressive glitch I know of in
Rolling Thunder, and the one
that never ceases to cause
people to say:
"What??? How did you DO
that???" In levels 5 and 10,
once you get to a certain
point in the level (around
halfway
through), you come up against
two boxes stacked on top of
each other (i.e. you can't
jump over it), and a platform
above
you (on which you jump and
continue to the right). At
this point, jump up onto the
platform, then position
yourself at the
very right edge of the railing
on the platform (you can only
jump up/down where railing is
present) which should
correspond to the very left
edge of the boxes, then (I
forget if you have to be
facing right for this to work,
but I don't think
so) jump down. This will put
you at the very left edge of
the boxes; then, making sure
not to move the joystick to
the left,
walk towards the right, hit
the jump button, and watch
yourself get sorta caught
between the bottom and top
boxes, then
jump right again, clearing the
top box and landing on the
ground. Now comes the neat
part. Don't fire at anyone,
and
don't panic, but simply go to
the right and watch yourself
WALK THROUGH EVERYBODY! Neat,
huh? You can simply walk
past everyone until you get to
the last guy (the guy in the
cloak). Then, if you have
properly stocked up on MG
bullets
earlier on this (or another)
level, simply hold down the
fire button and watch him
collapse an inch in front of
your face.


One last note about using this
is that on level 10, in that
last area before the final
arena, there's the
"stairs-like" hurdles,
and on each of these steps,
one of those annoying white
guys will appear. You have to
be careful not to be in too
much of
a hurry, or they will follow
you into the arena, where they
can and will hurt you, or keep
you busy enough that the guy
in
the cloak will. So make sure
you have a little extra time
to let those guys disappear
off the screen (after you've
made all
of them appear) before going
after the guy in the cloak in
the arena.

This is totally useless, but
fun to do anyway: at the end
of each level there is this
force field, which drags you
through the
door. Just before you get
sucked in, turn your back to
the exit and make low jumps
(jump button only) while
pushing the
joystick towards the
exit...That results in jumping
a bit backwards every time.
When the force field catches
you, you'll do
a cool Michael Jackson'esque
exit!

Tips and Tricks:


At the end of each level, at
THE VERY INSTANT the game
takes control and guides you
into the temple, pull
diagonally back and down on
the joystick. Do it right and
you'll get 10,000 points. To
my knowledge this works for
every level. My record is six
in a row. It's hard to time it
right, but it works!


A little after halfway through
stage thirteen (13) there is a
hidden bonus which can only be
gotten WITHOUT the extra which
fires straight up. You MUST
have the standard
semi-circular attack.

When in the right spot, jump
on the backs of enemies for
extra height and fire upwards
in a semi-circular arc.
Nothing will seem to happen
although it will make a sound
like you are hitting
something. After about 20
hits, a flag will drop which
is worth 1,000,000 points.

If the "invincibility" bonus
is gotten when having the 4
other bonuses, you get normal
invincibility (30 seconds)
-plus- 170,000 points.


A classical way of getting the
armor bonuses to appear is
just to wait...! Don't finish
a level without having gotten
at least 1 armor bonus.
Sometimes you can get 2 armor
bonuses in one level.

This is just a flaw with the
graphics. When standing beside
a rock, crouch and move away
from it, the player will
"hide" himself inside the rock
and will be unreachable by
most enemies for a short time.

This is not a cheat, but many
people don't realize it.
Shooting the question mark
repeatedly will turn it into a
shield. The trick is to
recognize it before you pick
it up, stop, crouch and shoot.


I'm not sure if this really
qualifies as a hint or cheat,
but it's quite fun and can
prove quite useful at times:

This only works if you do NOT
have the power-up which kills
creatures when you jump on
them.

On the screens with the
dragons which fly overhead and
occasionally swoop down at
you, it is possible to "hitch
a lift" and ride on their
backs. Wait until a dragon
approaches from the left and
swoops down at you. When it is
at its lowest point, simply
jump onto its back. You'll
find that you will continually
"bounce" on the dragons back,
and if you nudge the joystick
in time with the dragon's
movement you can stay on it
until the end of the level. At
this point the dragon will
disappear and you'll be safely
dropped to the ground.
Obviously, this method means
that you miss all the bonuses
in a level, but it can be
useful to skip over levels
with many tricky jumps etc.

Tips and Tricks

Scramble

by Tom Hirschfeld (1981)

               

CONTROLS

a. Four-directional joystick

b. LASER button

c. BOMB button


SCORING

a. Rocket: 50 points on the
ground, 80 points in the air
b. UFO: 100 points
c. Fuel tank; 150 points
d. Mystery base: 100, 200 or
300 points
e. Base: 800 points
f. 10 points every second
g. Bonus jet at 10,000 points


DANGERS

a. If the jet collides with
anything, it is destroyed.
b. If the jet runs out of
fuel, it is destroyed.


OBSERVATIONS

a. The jet can have only two
bombs on the screen at once
but can fire lasers in bursts
of four that need not detonate
or vanish before the next
burst can be fired.
Bombs fall in a diagonal
trajectory, and lasers fire
straight ahead to the right.

b. The jet can move up, down,
or forward, but never back.
When the player moves the
joystick to the right, the jet
accelerates in relation to the
landscape, which
always moves from right to
left at a uniform pace.

When the player moves the
joystick to the left, the jet
stops in relation to the
landscape until movement of
the landscape brings it
against the left edge of the
screen,
forcing it forward in relation
to the landscape.

Even when the joystick is all
the way to the right or left,
the jet can maneuver
vertically.

c. Whenever a jet is
destroyed, the next one
appears with a new fuel supply
at the beginning of the same
sector. Fuel consumption is a
function of time, independent
of the jet's speed.

d. Fuel tanks, when hit, give
the player both points and
fuel. The values of mystery
bases are determined randomly.

e. The player must pass
through five sectors to reach
the base. The sectors increase
in difficulty and come in the
same order every round.

f. Sector One presents little
challenge. The jet flies over
a hilly terrain littered with
rockets, fuel tanks and
mystery bases. Every plateau,
wide or narrow, has as many
objects as can fit. The only
real danger to the jet is that
the rockets take off
perpendicular to the planet
whenever they reach the middle
of the bottom edge, moving
sideways with the rest of the
landscape. If the player does
not react in time, his jet is
doomed.

g. In Sector Two, the only
difference is the swarm of
flitting UFOs that block the
jet's path, a maximum of three
or four on the screen at a
time. They do not shoot
and can be destroyed by laser
or bombs, but collision with
them is death.

h. In Sector Three, steering
is more important than firing.
Hordes of indestructible
fireballs hurtle from right to
left across the screen,
traveling fast enough to make
dodging them extremely risky
even for the best players. The
low hills at bottom, however,
provide cover for the jet. The
trick is to destroy the fuel
tanks and mystery
bases in the valleys and to
dart from valley to valley
without hitting the fireballs
that zoom every now and then
just over the hilltops.

i. Once the player makes it
through the fireballs, he
enters a series of tall
buildings of varying heights
over which he must fly in a
relatively narrow airspace.
Targets of
all kinds perch on rooftops,
and rockets nestle in silos up
to two inches deep. The jet
must steer through even the
narrowest passages cautiously,
in case a rocket
takes off right under it.

j. Sector Five requires the
most precise maneuvers of all.
Horizontal passages, just wide
enough to accommodate the jet,
connect large caverns in which
the player
must fly all the way from top
to bottom or back with very
little horizontal room. To
make matters worse, both the
passages and the caverns can
have rows of fuel
tanks along the floor. If the
jet tries to pass through
these areas without shooting
the fuel tanks in its path, it
will crash.

k. At last, the base. The jet
must make its way through a
maze just as treacherous as
the last, except this time
with more than just survival
as its goal. At the bottom
of every canyon over which the
jet flies lies the base, a
large octagon with flashing
lights. The base must be
destroyed by bomb or laser;
until a base is destroyed, the
jet flies over canyon after
canyon, using up fuel. When
the player does manage to
destroy the base, the jet
starts over in Sector One.

The difficulty in destroying
the base lies in the fact that
the jet appears to be flying
too high to reach it by laser,
and the canyons are too narrow
for the use of bombs.
Many players do not realize,
however, that the jet is
dispensable once the base is
destroyed. In other words,
once the jet has come close
enough to the base to
demolish it with a bomb or
laser, it can crash against a
wall and still be reusable in
the next round.

l. With the beginning of each
round, another little flag
appears at bottom right. Every
round is the same as the first
in every detail, with
identical terrain and target
deployment, except that up
until the fourth flag, the
fuel is consumed somewhat
faster each round.


STRATEGIES

a. Always watch what passes
below you as you fly,
especially in Sectors One
through Four.

b. Ignore the 10 points added
to your score every second:
you want to finish each round
quickly, because running out
of fuel is bad news.

Try also to hit as many fuel
tanks as you can, even in
preference to mystery bases.
One hundred and fifty points
plus fuel is more desirable
than an average mystery
score of 200 points.

c. When you fuel gets low, the
rule is to ignore everything
but speed survival, and
getting more fuel.

d. In Sector One, fly close to
the ground. Your object should
be scoring points rather than
precise maneuvering, so keep
in mind just a few simple
rules: 

1. Fly slowly only when you
must to destroy a rich cluster
of targets.

2. Release a couple of bombs
just as you top each mountain,
then descend quickly into the
valley.

3. Once there, shoot any
threatening rockets by slowing
down for a second and using
your laser. Descend to the
lowest plateau at the earliest
opportunity, shooting
lasers constantly to clear
your path of targets.

4. Rise with the terrain,
using your laser against
targets in the foothills, and
go all the way up only when
the next mountain forces you
to.

5. After the last mountain, be
prepared for the UFOs.

e. Through Sector Two, simply
fly relatively low at medium
speed, pressing LASER and BOMB
constantly. The laser shots
will take care of almost all
the UFOs in
your way. If one or two
survive until you reach them,
shift to full speed until you
pass them, dodging vertically
if necessary.

Try to time the release of
your bombs so that they hit
fuel tanks, compensating for
your middling speed.

f. Don't try to stay alive
among the fireballs. Staying
below them makes sense for two
reasons - you keep your jet,
and you even have a chance to
pick up some
points from the sparse targets
below.

As for making if from valley
to valley, just go where the
fireballs aren't. Fly quickly
through each valley, then stop
just before you leave shelter.
Wait there until a
fireball passes just over you;
then chances are that you will
have a second in which to duck
swiftly over and into the next
valley. You will find there is
definitely a
rhythm to it.

g. If you fly through the city
too fast, you might not be
able to react in time to a
juicy cluster of targets or to
a rocket rising in your path.
Fly at medium speed, lasering
and bombing for all you are
worth, especially at rockets
in front of you and fuel tanks
beneath you.

When you fly over silos too
deep for your bombs to
penetrate, accelerate for a
moment in case the rockets
suddenly take off toward your
underside.

Treat a low roof just as you
would a Sector One valley;
descend and laser the row of
targets into oblivion. Be
careful, though, when
reascending; the rises here
are
much more abrupt than Sector
One.

h. Without excellent vertical
control, you will never make
it through Sector Five.
Blasting away the fuel tanks
blocking your path is vital,
but requires much less of
your concentration than does
piloting the jet through such
a tortuous maze.

As soon as you emerge from a
passageway, stop. Then move up
or down, whichever you need,
as far as you can until the
screen catches up with you and
pushes
you forward. Keep the joystick
to the left; while the screen
propels you, you should have
time to find just the right
height for entering the next
passage.

Once you are in the next
passage, speed up right away,
giving yourself a head start
for the next cavern; you will
have to stop once again when
you enter it. The cycle
requires concentration even
once you know the rhythm.

Sometimes, you will enter a
cavern at top left and need to
leave it through a passage at
bottom right, but fuel tanks
will block the mouth of the
passage, cluttering
even the cavern floor. If you
are worried about crashing
into these tanks from above
before you have a chance to
laser them, just drop a couple
of bombs at the right
moment in your descent. The
tanks will stand in your way
no longer.

i. Once you know its secrets,
the base may actually be
slightly easier than Sector
Five. To destroy the enemy
octagon, all you have to do is
gun your engine before
you enter its canyon, then
pull sharply down and back,
and nose up to it. If you are
on its level, fire your laser;
if just above, drop a bomb.
You will destroy the base.

You will also crash your own
ship, but no matter: you will
start the next round with a
free replacement. Most players
are afraid of crashing, so
they fly too high for
their bombs to have any hope
of reaching the base.
Eventually, they crash or run
out of fuel.

j. By now, you have probably
realized the one step
essential to mastering
SCRAMBLE; memorization. Since
the pattern repeats itself
every round, being prepared
for upcoming opportunities and
dangers is what the game is
about.

Tips and Tricks:


There is a 30,000 point bonus
awarded at the end of each
stage accomplished without
using any shuriken or bullets
(only "chens").


Bosses 1 and 4 can be killed
by simply pressing jump and
immediately shooting after
that (sort of a jumpshoot!)


At the level just before the
falling Buddhas, you'll reach
a spot between ventilation
pipes, where lots of blue
ninjas show up. Instead of
using the ninja magic,
position yourself at the right
in this tight spot then jump
back till you reach the open
area, where you can take care
of the ninjas.


On stage 3-1 and 3-2 there are
enemies that use bazookas as a
weapon. If you bump into them
by walking into them, making
the "ouch" noise for 6 to 10
times, every enemy will not
shoot for the rest of the
stage! You can just walk into
any enemy that wields a gun.
Just be careful of the guys
that have swords - they will
still kill you.


In level 3-4 at the Buddhas,
run up to them and keep
shooting. Stand there shooting
and they will move closer to
you. Just
before they bump you back, use
your magic. As soon as you use
it, rapidly tap the right,
jump and fire buttons. The
Buddhas will continue to move
over the top of you. If done
correctly, once you return to
the original state, your
character
will continue to bounce back
and forth between the Buddhas.
Remember you should still be
tapping the joystick right and
the jump and fire buttons all
rapidly and simultaneously.
Keep this up until you exit
the Buddhas from the other
side,
and then wait until they clear
the screen and finish the boss
off.

and Michael Metz


Sinistar started out life as
Juggernaut, then Dark Star.


There was an office joke that
when the Sinistar said "Run
Coward", it sounded like
"Ron Howard", which is
where is received its
nickname: "Opie-Star"


Sinistar Easter Eggs:
Programming Credits and
Williams message


1. Set lives to 1 (This is
optional, it merely saves
time)

2. Insert one credit

3. Bump into a Planetoid
(rock)

4. Push the fire button seven
times

5. Avoid Planetoids and
Workers, don't fire at
anything and get shot by a
Warrior. If you set lives to
1, the game will now be over.
If not, lose all lives in
this manner until the game
ends.

6. Enter initials

7. Press the 2 Player button
3 times, then insert one coin
and start a new 1 Player game

8. Don't move or fire, just
push the Sinibomb button once.


There are now two messages
which can be displayed- for
the credits:


9. Insert 3 coins, then push
the Sinibomb button again.
The 'crossword' credits should
now be displayed

For the Williams Electronics
message:

10. Simply end the game by
getting shot without hitting
a Planetoid or firing, then
push the 1 Player button to
display the message.


Easter Egg 2: There is a bug
in the game that allows an
enemy shot still on screen to
kill you while you are
spinning in Sinistar's mouth,
thus killing you twice.
However, this bug can be
used to your advantage
because if you have no extra
lives left before you get
double killed your lives
count goes to -1 (which in
computer speak is a really
big number, so this "cheat"
allows you to get a major
power-up).

The game's original program 
was changed to make it more
difficult, due to management
decisions that it was too 
easy. According to the de-
signers, this was totally 
against their wishes, as it
spoiled a perfect balance of
gameplay and the game's
smooth animation sequences.
RJ Mical has the original 
program burned into a set of
roms in his possession, so
maybe someday....?


Some Sinistar machines came
in a Duramold cabinet. Only
three other games came in
this cabinet, and are highly
sought out collector's items.


There may have been a 
cocktail version of the game
produced. Here is an excerpt
from a thread from Noah 
Falstein, R.J.Mical:


Query: "Does anyone have 
credible evidence about the 
existence of a Sinistar 
Cocktail Model?"


RJ: "Noah - They made a cocktail unit,
didn't they?"  
 
  
Noah: "I'm sure I remember seeing 
a cocktail unit at Williams, but 
it might have been a prototype.  
My very spotty memory suggests 
that there were in fact a handful 
of cocktail units sold -- the 
numbers I remember hearing were 
about 3000 uprights, 2000 sit-
downs, and (I'm very vaguely 
remembering Ken Fedesna or some 
other management person talking 
here) less than 100 cocktails. 
But that could have been orders 
that they decided not to fill.  
Sorry I can't be more positive."  


There are a total of five 
revisions of this game.


There is an early pre-release
romset of this game available. 
See Sinistar (Prototype)
for details.

Format

$bio
This romset is allegedly from
a early release machine that
was displayed at the 1982
AMOA show in Las Vegas.
Two Sinistar programmers,
RJ Mical and Noah Falstein,
believe this to be so,
but it's not confirmed.


Here's some gameplay info and
differences courtesy of
Sinistar page and Doug Stoffa,
from whose machine these
images were dumped:


1.Sinistar scream cuts off
during quick re-triggers,
rather than one long
scream.


2.More crystals per planetoid.


3.Sinistar death sometimes
occurs offscreen.


4.Warp to next level in random
direction, not just upper
right.


5.Some parameters in operator
adjust screen not present,
such
as set attract mode message.


6.You don't spin out when
eaten
by the Sinistar.  You just
explode when you get too
close.


7.Once Sinistar is defeated,
you do not get locked into
your
location on the screen.  You
can move as if he were still
alive. The warping direction
is not random as initially
thought, but is in the
direction your ship is facing
when the battle computer
engages warp engines.


8.The set has some other weird
behavior which I will call
screen wrapping.  It involves
enemies passing through the
window of gameplay and then
re-appearing immediately.


9. The FIRE button advances
the letter entry for high
scores rather than the
joystick's move-right.


10.Instead of having the
word "SINISTAR" appear in
red in the center of the
screen in the standard font
this set has a big red word 
SINISTAR in the shape of the
word on the marquee appear
before all the standard font
SINISTARs pop up.  It drips
blood in a few places.

Tips and Tricks:


Here's a great cheat for Slap 
Fight. Insert a credit and 
select 1 player. When you 
begin the level, just sit 
there - don't kill anything. 
Let your player be destroyed. 
When you begin again, you'll 
have all weapons and 
powerups! 


If you don't fire at all, but 
dodge your way through the 
enemy shots as long as 
possible, you'll get a big 
bonus and start your next 
life just before the second 
big boss. You have to get as 
far as the ring shaped pool 
to get this.

#Smash T.V.
$info=smashtv
$icon=smashtv
$data
$bio
Tips and Tricks:


Don't try to conserve ammo. 
Your shots should be efficient 
and kill as much as possible, 
and you won't have time to 
think about conserving shots 
(especially in the latter 
stages). The pattern of moves 
you should follow at the end 
of each board to reach the 
easiest boards is:


Level 1: right, up; and then 
you have no choices.

Level 2: up, right; and then 
again, no choices.

Level 3: right, right, down; 
and then you have no choices.


Tips on big guys:


Mutoid man: Stay *above* him. 
The best hiding place is at 
the upper corners of the 
board. Then nothing can get 
you, except Mr. Shrapnel. Best
weapons are Shrieker grenades, 
then spread fire.


Scarface: There are two attack 
types you use against this 
guy. The first is when you 
have grenades/shrieker 
grenades and are invulnerable. 
Then you blast away at his 
face. Be sure to get all areas 
of his face. The second is 
when you have spread/missiles/
double. Then you travel 
around him in circles and 
knock out his perimeter 
shielding. If you don't get 
all his perimeter shielding 
he CANNOT die. This is why
most
people find him so hard. Then 
he is converted to a skull. 
When you have grenades/
shriekers, be sure to get ALL 
areas of the face! Otherwise
attack the top of his head, 
and in general keep him away 
from you.


Cobra: You should fire at all 
areas of the cobra body. Don't 
move above the cobra heads, 
because you will die. Best 
weapon: spread fire.


Game show host: Same as mutoid 
man but moves really fast. 
Play cautiously. Note that you 
can stay at the upper-right-
hand corner of the screen 
forever, picking up unlimited 
points on Mr. Shrapnel. This 
is slow, however.


The game is known to adjust 
its difficulty by the daily 
high score list. If the high 
scores are too high, making 
the game too hard, just turn 
the machine off and on again.


Now, the pleasure dome. This 
is hearsay, so don't get upset 
if this doesn't work. 
Sometimes, instead of saying 
"COLLECT POWERUPS!" on the 
second board, it'll say 
something else. When that 
happens, it means you can get 
to the pleasure dome that
game. 
When you get to key room #1 
(after the cobras) you can go 
down after the board is 
completed. Tough rooms follow. 
In the pleasure dome, you 
collect girls instead of 
gifts. It isn't possible to
get to the pleasure dome on 
some machines.


Felix Lee says this applies to 
Rom Version 8 and up. You can 
tell what version, he says, by 
the message in room #3 
("Collect TEN keys" instead of 
"Collect keys"). He also says 
that this is hearsay. He adds 
that if you discover "Secret 
Warp 3", you've just 
experienced the game's error-
recovery system at work.
[Can anyone provide more info 
on these? --Roger]


When playing with 2 people, if 
one player finishes the level 
near an exit, the other will 
"walk through the wall" to the
next room. This can be useful 
on some levels.


You can cheat the enemy men 
by running through them 
backwards (to do this, you 
have to be firing). This 
works especially well when you 
have extra speed.


Here's a list of fun things to 
do:

When fighting Mutoid Man or 
the Host, get a shield and 
stand behind the boss. If he 
backs up far enough, he will 
push you back out the wall 
area he came in. You can not 
be hit there, and if you 
position yourself right, you 
can fire from that position. 
This isn't really a cheat 
since you need special weapons 
to kill the boss. You can 
leave the area by simply
moving down.


If you have the sawblades and 
are moving right next to the 
exit and so is the other 
person, the sawblades will not 
have time to disappear and 
will be carried to the next 
wave. It's nice to see those 
sawblades cut up the camera 
men. Also, you can sometimes 
get another sawblade set for 
the other player because the 
software doesn't realize that 
you still have that set you 
should have lost. Dueling 
sawblades!


After killing a boss monster, 
if player one stands next to 
the exit and player two stands 
to the left of some mines, 
player two will be dragged 
across the mines at no extra 
charge. FEARLESS MINE WALKER! 
This can also work on any wave
ending, but you get more time 
to position player one and two 
on the end of a level.

Tips and Tricks:


1. On the first ten stages, 
you can easily rack of close 
to a million points. The trick 
is to defeat all of the 
enemies by pushing only one 
snowball. If properly done, 
seven or eight banners will 
come down from the top of the 
screen, and they are worth 
10,000 points each. If you can
do this eight or nine times, 
and you have collected the red 
(speed up) potion, you will 
easily get 700,000-1,000,000 
points by the time you get to 
the first boss.


To get the various coloured 
potions, try to kill all of 
the enemies of the same color 
group using as few snowballs 
as possible. The color of the 
enemy determines the color of
the potion. There are four 
potions:


1.red=speedup

2.blue=powerful shots

3.yellow=extended range

4. green=allows you to collect 
the letters S-N-O-W, which 
gives you an extra man.

The original sequel to
Asteroids, it was shelved
when Asteroids Deluxe was
green-lighted for production.
When Asteroids Deluxe tanked,
this game was taken off the
shelf and released to moderate
success.


Tips and Tricks:


When in non-linked mode, it is 
possible to get a full shield 
during the bonus round. The 
way is to run the shield down 
to nothing (speaker makes no 
shield sound), then bounce 
off white walls for > 5 times 
with the shield button down. 
Suddenly the shield will be at 
full strength again. Anyone 
who has played in this non-
linked mode knows the edge 
that a full shield gives.

The game that started the 
whole damn craze!! SI caused
a yen shortage in Japan. Many
regular produce and goods
stores in Japan removed
their products and converted
into SI parlors overnight,
complete with giant speakers 
broadcasting the 
"thump-thump-thump" of the 
marching invaders. A classic 
in every sense of the word.


Space Invaders was the first
arcade game to work it's way
out of seedy arcades and into
pizza parlors and ice cream
shops. 


The SI phenomenon stuns
conservative adults who are
certain the games sour the 
minds of their youngsters.
Residents of Mesquite,
Texas push the issue all the
way to the Supreme Court
in their efforts to ban the
illicit machines from their
Bible-belt community. 


Tips and Tricks:


Space Invaders has a hidden 
message. To see it, wait until 
the demo starts and then press 
at the same time the keys
left,
right, fire, 1player start and 
2player start. Press them 
repeatedly as fast as you can. 
After a few seconds a message 
appears under the high score.

This trick works in the 
original Space Invaders 
machine and Space Invaders 
Deluxe. 


To achieve higher scores, 
count the number of shots 
fired from your base. Begin 
counting shots as soon as 
each level begins. Fire 22 
shots and then wait for the 
UFO to cross the screen. Use 
shot number 23 to hit the UFO 
and you will receive 300 
points. After hitting the UFO, 
start counting your shots 
again. This time, count to 14 
and use the 15th shot to hit 
the UFO. Once again you will 
receive 300 points. Repeat 
counting using the 14 shot 
method until the screen is 
cleared of enemies. When the 
next level starts, repeat the 
procedure using 22 shots, 14 
shots, 14 shots, etc.  Make 
sure you count every shot, 
regardless of what it hits. If 
your base happens to be 
destroyed, continue counting 
where you left off. 

The UFO will not come out if 
there are less than 8 space 
invaders left.

The true sequel to the
original. Midway licensed
a different version for
US consumption (SI Deluxe).
Changes in gameplay include
invaders that march forward,
invaders that split to form
two when shot, another bonus
ship that flies by above the 
invaders, intermissions
between racks, and the famous
"rainbow bonus."


Tips and Tricks:


Here's a tip for Space
Invaders
Deluxe: On any wave, make sure 
that the last alien you kill 
is in the bottom two rows, 
and you'll get a special 
"fireworks" display and a 500-
point bonus. If the bottom 
leftmost invader is the last 
killed, the bonus increases 
to 1,000 points!

Hardware design and
game program for
Cinematronics by
Larry Rosenthal


Space Wars was the first
vector game. Many buttons, a
gigantic cabinet. The game
was originally brought to 
Midway, but Rosenthal balked
at their ridiculous royalty
offer. He sold the game and
hardware to Cinematronics,
and signed a contract for
50% of the royalties; unheard
of in those days. Rosenthal
later left Cinematronics,
taking all technical 
documents with him, and 
leaving poor Tim Skelly to
scrounge for information.
Luckily, he found a tech who
had helped Rosenthal when he
was pressed for time and 
obtained the opcodes and
technical info needed.
Cinematronics sued 
Rosenthal, but they
settled, with Larry's
company, Vectorbeam, being
bought by Cinematronics.
Looks like ol' Larry made

From KLOV (http://www.tc.umn.
edu/~johns594/arcade/klov/):

This driving game is very
intense. Your perspective is
somewhat overhead and
behind the hood of the car. A
very fast game. In fourth gear
you are moving extremely fast
and control is difficult,
making
for exciting and hectic
maneuvers. The oncoming
traffic is always the same car
composed of 3-dimensional
"wireframe" vector graphics --
very impressive and ahead of
their time -- similar to the
enemy tanks in Battlezone. The
stationary objects are not as
impressive and usually crudely
rendered.

The car was based on one
of the designer's own Nissan 
280z.The game was to have a
helicopter stage but the
designers ran out of 
resources. They also wanted
the James Bond theme to
play, but settled for the
Peter Gunn theme instead.


Trivia:


If you are lucky enough to 
play the arcade version of 
Spy Hunter, you can break
(yes, 
physically) the accelerator 
pedal by pulling it out toward 
you. This really can work to 
your advantage because it 
allows you to press your pedal 
down further than normal. This 
has the effect of allowing the 
car to drive at a 
substantially faster rate. 
I do not know if this works on 
the sit-down version of the 
game. You will be able to 
outrun anything in the game. 
Just remember to watch out for 
any cars or objects in front 
of you. Just remember to
return 
the pedal back to normal
before 
you leave.

The star constellation in the
background was actually the 
outline of a centerfold from 
a 1980 issue of OUI magazine.
When management found out 
after shipping about 5000
units, they flipped out and
almost stopped production.
They eventually came to their
senses and nothing was
changed.


The Atari 2600 game "Yar's
Revenge" originated from a
rough version of Star Castle
for that system which never
made it to production.


Tips and Tricks:


Star Castle

by Tom Hirschfeld (1981)

               


Controls


a. Left and right ROTATE 
buttons


b. THRUST button


c. FIRE button



SCORING


a. Outer ring: 10 points per 
side destroyed


b. Middle ring: 20 points per 
side destroyed


c. inner ring: 30 points per 
side destroyed


d. Bonus plus extra ship for 
each cannon destroyed



DANGERS


a. Small bombs from the castle 
walls destroy the player's
ship on impact.


b. Center cannon shoots lethal 
fireballs.



OBSERVATIONS


a. The player's ship can shoot 
in bursts of three and travel 
behind the screen. Whenever it 
strikes the outer boundaries 
of the castle, whether or not 
there are any walls there, it 
automatically rebounds in the 
opposite direction.


b. The three "energy-rings" of 
the castle are actually 
dodecagons. The twelve sides 
of each ring must be hit twice 
to be destroyed; after the 
first time, they glow to show 
they have been hit.

Two of the rings turn quickly 
in different directions, and 
the third turns slowly. 
Whenever the outer ring is 
completely destroyed, the 
middle and inner ones enlarge
and move out, and a new one 
forms around the cannon. Since 
the player's main goal is to 
destroy the cannon, he must 
shoot selectively.


c. The central cannon's barrel 
always follows the player's 
ship around the screen, slowly 
at first. Whenever gaps in all 
three rings pass before the 
barrel at once, it takes 
advantage of the opportunity 
by releasing a fireball. 
Because the barrel usually 
points to the player's ship, 
the ship is often in the path 
of the fireball.

When the cannon is hit, the 
player receives a bonus ship 
and credit for all the ring 
segments remaining in the 
castle.


d. Like the fireball, the 
bombs cannot pass behind the 
screen, as the player's ship 
and its missiles can.

There are never more than
three
bombs on the screen at once. 
They pass from the inner ring 
to the middle to the outer and 
then into space, where they 
track the player's ship. The 
ship can destroy them with 
missiles, but they bring no 
points.


e. As time passes, whether 
cannons are destroyed or not, 
everything speeds up. The 
bombs become faster than the 
spaceship, the rings revolve 
more quickly, and the cannon 
no longer merely turns to face 
the ship when the player 
emerges from behind the 
screen; it blinks into 
position.



STRATEGIES


a. Get used to using the edges 
of the screen. it will come 
in handy once you start using 
the patterns set forth below, 
and it's always a good habit 
in ASTEROIDS-type games.


b. After a certain point in 
the game, you must learn 
never to stay in one place 
for more than a second.


c. It's a shame that the game 
speeds up with time instead 
of with each cannon destroyed 
otherwise, you could play 
indefinitely simply by 
destroying the first 
castle's outer ring over and 
over. As it is, though, you 
must take as little time as 
possible to destroy each 
castle, ensuring a steady 
supply of bonus ships.


d. Except for shifting the 
slow ring to the middle later 
in the game (see Strategy i.) 
try not to let a castle grow 
new rings, it wastes time.


e. Similarly, shoot an 
approaching bomb only if it is 
alone and you do not wont to 
move. Otherwise, you are 
wasting your time, gaining no 
points, and taking the risk
of missing.


f. When you have only the 
inner ring between you and 
the cannon and you are close
enough, a triple burst will 
destroy it before it has a 
chance to retaliate.


g. When the game begins to 
speed up, try this simple 
pattern: go to the center of 
the left or right edge and 
face the edge of the screen. 
Your shots will cross behind
and hit the other side of the 
castle.


As soon as the bombs get too 
close for comfort, simply 
thrust about an inch forward 
and you will be on the other 
side of the screen, still 
firing at the castle. As the
bombs cross the screen towards 
you, turn around and repeat 
the procedure.


h. Once the game is at maximum 
speed, you will need a more 
sophisticated technique. Here 
it is:


Spend all your time in two 
opposite corners. You should 
dart back and forth behind the
screen developing a turn-
thrust-shoot rhythm and 
synchronizing it with the
outer ring so that you are 
always shooting at the same 
spot. Once you perfect this 
method, the cannon and bombs 
will never be fast enough to 
do more than almost destroy 
you.


i. For best effect, the corner 
pattern should be followed 
with the slow ring in the 
middle. You can shift it to 
this position by quickly 
destroying the outer wall 
twice before beginning your 
attack in earnest.

Tips and Tricks:


You can determine which 
direction the end of level 
boss will move before it even 
appears by looking at your 
score. If the hundreds digit 
is odd, the boss will move to 
the left. If it is even, it'll 
move right (the tens and units 
digits are always zero).


At some points in the game you 
will see two columns of green 
arrows down the center of the 
screen. Concentrate on either 
the left or right column of 
these arrows, and try to shoot 
16 in a row. You will be 
awarded an 80,000 bonus for 
doing this. The first time 
these appear, it is possible 
to get two such bonuses in a 
row (if there are not many 
enemies around!), and 
sometimes more if the level 
ends before the column has 
finished appearing. Later on 
there is a short column of 
only 16, so only one bonus is 
possible here.


On the violet continent, if 
you see a coelacanth fossil 
on the left side, go to the 
-right- side and shoot. 
Cleopatra appears - shoot her 
and you'll get a million-point 
bonus. The coelacanth may only 
appear on the third violet 
continent.


To get a 50,000 point bonus:


You've seen a big enemy that 
combines into parts. When you 
hear the tune it is about to 
appear, STOP SHOOTING. (You 
don't actually have to stop 
shooting altogether, but if 
you hit part of the enemy 
before the center part flashes 
white the bonus will not
work).
Position your ship so that you 
are just underneath the center 
part of the enemy and wait for 
it to flash white. Once this 
has happened, shoot the center 
part several times: the enemy 
will be destroyed and you will 
be awarded the 50,000 point 
special bonus.

The basic game engine for
Star Wars was converted 
from a 2-year old space
game project called
Warp-Speed, which was
designed to develop 3-D
image capabilities.
The controls were adapted
from the controls used for
Army Battlezone.


As Luke's Tie-Fighter 
zooms toward the Death 
Star, players can barely
make out the words, "May
The Force Be With You" on
the Death Star's face.


Star Wars was the first
Atari game to have speech.
All of the phrases were 
taken directly from the 
movie.


If the player hits Darth
Vader's Tie Fighter 30
times, the player is
awarded 255 extra shields.


Tips and Tricks:


If on the tie-fighter dogfight 
stage, Darth Vader's ship is 
shot more than 30 times the 
player is given 27 extra 
shields. If you're really 
lucky you'll get 255 extra 
shields, but this is quite 
rare.


On the Death Star run, use the 
force to increase scores 
tremendously. Don't start 
shooting until the message
"USE 
THE FORCE" disappears. This 
means dodging everything the 
Empire throws at you. You get 
a bonus for doing this. 5000
on 
the first level, which 
increases to as high as 100000 
on the higher levels.

and Larry DeMar


Stargate was the first game
designed by Vidkidz, the 
design firm founded by Jarvis
and DeMar when they decided 
to go independent. Williams
became desperate for a game
after the designers left, so
they took Vidkidz under
contract. Stargate took four
months to complete. All
Vidkidz games were designed
on a dual 8" floppy, 1 MHz
6809 Motorola Exorcisor 
system that cost $30,000(!)
in those days.


The name was changed to
Defender II right after the
game had stopped being
manufactured, because
Williams wanted to make
sure they could own the
trademark on the title.


Tips and Tricks:


An undocumented feature: you 
need to have killed everything 
off in the wave except for one 
lander. There must be at least 
one humanoid on the ground. 
Wait for the lander to pick up 
the humanoid. Shoot the lander 
and catch the humanoid *just*
before it hits the ground. The 
screen will flash like mad and 
you will be awarded 2000, 
presumably for catching the 
humanoid and depositing it on 
the ground in the tiny
interval 
before the wave ends. 


If you go in to the warp gate 
and press reverse and warp at 
the same time you will make 
the screen mess up. It will 
look like you are going super 
fast from left to right, kinda 
like a cardiograph at high 
speed. This will kill the game 
that you are playing.

$info=strkforc

Tips and Tricks:


To reach the ultimate bad guy 
without having to go through 
the entire enemy starship, you 
just play the LEFT player, and
get yourself killed at the far 
LEFT end of the starship (the 
very beginning). When you 
reincarnate, you'll be at the 
far RIGHT end of the board, 
past the wall (or IN the wall 
if you weren't far enough 
left). The boss will not
appear until you move to the 
left past where he should be 
(though things will start 
firing at you immediately). 
Kill the boss, get your free
credit, start again.


Strategy tip: Kill 
dreadnoughts with one timewarp 
and one cluster bomb. You 
always get the time warp back, 
plus other goodies.


Score hogging tip: Clear out 
all the planets but one, and 
then fly around from starbase 
to starbase waiting for
dreadnoughts to appear. Pick 
'em off using the above 
method. This gets boring after 
a while, of course...

#Super Basketball
$info=sbasketb
$icon=sbasketb
$data
$bio
Tips and Tricks:


Super Basketball's angle and 
timing rules:


Free Throws: 41-44 and 46-49% 
= 1 pt and 3 seconds, 45% = 2 
pts and 5 seconds.


Jump Shots: Varies by
location, 
45% sinks from anywhere ("nice 
shot"), 5 seconds.


Dunk Shots: Same as above, 
grants one extra second.


Lose 5 seconds for each 
turnover, unless game clock is 
already at :09 or below.


Speed and time are essential. 
The big points are scored on 
the after-game bonuses, and 
you need to score tons of 
points to beat the World 
Champs. Here's how:


The primary sweet spot on the 
floor is the baseline (right 
edge) on the right (bottom) 
side of the basket, anywhere 
inside 3 point range. You can 
win most games shooting only 
from here. Dribble there every 
chance you get and shoot while
running out of bounds -- the 
computer can't block the shot 
and any reasonably angled shot 
will go in.


The secondary sweet spot is 
the bottom left corner of the 
free throw line. Periodically 
one of your players will post
up in this spot -- a quick
pass 
to him results in an easy shot 
if it's taken immediately. The 
computer can sometimes stop 
the play, but it's such a fast 
striking shot that it can pay 
off big when time is running 
low.


Basic strategy is score fast, 
score often, you need the 
time. Pass north-south, not 
east-west and you can get 
around the defenders to the 
baseline. Take most of your 
shots from there as outlined 
above, and you should score 
fast enough to beat most
teams.


On bonus shot screens, just 
shoot like crazy. You can have
multiple balls onscreen at 
once, so don't bother aiming.


After about the 4th team, 
you're better off just 
avoiding passing altogether 
as they pick off the balls 
too often.


Move diagonally as much as 
possible rather than straight 
forward, and when under the 
hoop, you don't need to make 
a full jump to get it in easy
-
that just makes it easier to
be blocked.


When you're shooting free 
throws, hold down the shoot 
button until the angle 
indicator is between 85 and 
90 degrees. The ball will go 
straight up, bounce off the 
shooter's head, and bounce off 
the screen, awarding you a 
5,000 point bonus.


If you're moving without the 
ball (say after a shot, to go 
rebound) it seems that you 
can run faster if you 
"dribble" even though you
don't 
have a ball to do that with.

Tips and Tricks:


Ever wonder why the attract 
mode says "Go for 98%"? It's 
because if you cover at least 
98% of the playing surface, 
you're rewarded with a free 
credit. This is very possible 
if you get the "freeze" 
powerup.


This seems to happen only on 
the third level and after in 
MAME. If anyone has any more 
details on this, please let 
me know.

When finishing a level, try to 
trap the Qix in the area that 
gets filled in when you draw 
your last line. If you do this
successfully, the game will 
assume that you filled in 99% 
of the playfield and award you 
a 29,000-point bonus.


You can get bonuses for 
spelling out certain words in 
Super Qix. For the first word, 
"castle", it's a 60,000 point 
bonus for spelling the word 
entirely, and you get a free 
ride to the next level no 
matter what percent of space 
you've filled.


Here is the list of the words 
you have to complete to get
the 
PERFECT bonus :


01 : CASTLE

02 : THUNDER

03 : ROCKMAN

04 : DRAGON

05 : FANFARE

06 : PLANET

07 : GERDEN (might be GARDEN, 
depending on bootlegs)

09 : TOYBOX

10 : FOUNTAIN

11 : MERMAID

12 : CHIP

13 : FLOWER

14 : TENGU

15 : ROCKET

You get 10,000 points of bonus 
for each letter in the word.

#Tac-Scan
$info=tacscan
$icon=tacscan
$data
$bio
Tips and Tricks:


The most effective strategy 
for extending your playing 
time in Tac-Scan is to add as 
many extra ships as possible 
to your reserve (listed in 
upper-left corner of screen). 
Ships must be caught by the 
leading ship position which 
is further signified by a red 
colored underline in order to 
be added to your reserve. To 
begin capturing ships you must 
have at least one open 
position in your fleet; 
otherwise the game will not 
award ships (kill off two of 
your ships on the edges of 
your fleet at the very 
beginning of the game to 
achieve the highest amount of 
reserve ships during the first 
wave).

Wave one in Tac-Scan should 
always be played with a
minimum 
of two ships in your fleet, 
with additional ships added as 
the levels get faster and 
harder. The second and third 
wave can almost always be 
effectively played with only 
two ships, and it is very 
important not to waste 
reserve ships in these two 
waves (saving those ships 
for the more dangerous 
first wave).


Always keep changing
directions 
on both wave 1 and 2. It is 
very effective to destroy 
ships while turning on wave 1, 
and on wave 2 ships will have
a hard time hitting you if you 
don't stay in the same
position 
for very long.


The faster you fire, the 
shorter your shots will
travel. 
Allowing a short pause between 
shots will allow them to 
travel the distance of the 
screen.

much positive feedback.
Digitized belches were going

Tips and Tricks:

Targ

by Tom Hirschfeld (1981)
               


Controls


a. Four-directional joystick

b. FIRE button



SCORING 


a. Ramship:l0+ points

b. Smuggler: 100-900 points

c. Bonus at end of each screen

d. Extended play for beating 
day's high score


DANGERS


a. Collision with any ramship
or 
smuggler destroys the Wummel.


OBSERVATIONS


a. The screen is a grid of 
corridors through which the 
player's Wummel and its 
enemies, the Spectar 
smugglers and the Targ 
ramships, move.


b. The Wummel turns quickly to 
the right or left but must 
decelerate before reversing, 
it can have one shot on the 
screen at a time, shooting in 
the same direction it is
moving.


c. Ten Targ ramships appear at 
the beginning of each round. 
They all want to ram the 
Wummel, which tries to shoot 
them. Unfortunately, they 
are reluctant to be in front 
of him in any corridor, 
turning away as soon as they 
can. They do like chasing him, 
though.


d. As time passes within a 
round, the ramships become 
faster.


e. One Spectar smuggler at a 
time, having a random value, 
also pursues the Wummel. When 
one smuggler is destroyed, one 
of the blocks of the grid 
becomes hollow, soon releasing 
the next smuggler. At the end 
of each round, the Targ 
ramships' value is raised by 
10 points, and the player 
receives a bonus of 1,000 
points after the first round, 
2000 after the second and so 
forth. The villains do, 
however, gain more speed and 
cunning with each round.


STRATEGIES


a. if you need to reverse 
quickly, turn twice. Your 
first turn should be into a 
block or the side of the maze, 
and your sec- ond will produce 
an about-face.


b. Since the ramships will 
never want to be in front of 
you for more than a moment at 
most, you must almost always 
take them by surprise.


c. It is easier to ambush one 
at a time than several, so use 
guerrilla tactics unless you 
are trapped.


d. When you materialize at 
bottom right, go two or three 
columns to the left and rise, 
shooting.


e. When on enemy is about to 
cross you. path but you think 
it might ram you, slow down 
and get ready to shoot. Your 
ability to accelerate and 
decelerate is something the 
bad guys don't have.


f. When you are being pursued, 
turn away, turn again after 
one block, and immediately 
reverse, surprising your 
enemy when it reaches the 
second corner.


g. Whenever a smuggler is near 
you, find a way to shoot it. 
Try always to have one or two 
targets in mind: the sooner
you 
finish the round, the less
time 
your enemies will have to
speed 
up. Be ready for tougher 
enemies with each succeeding 
round.


h. TARG is one game in which 
strategy must become almost 
reflex as the action quickens.

Tips and Tricks:


In the sewer level, if you 
align your foot very close to 
the edge of the step without 
falling down, you can be 
invincible. You can still hit 
them with whatever type of 
attack you want, but they 
can't hit you.


You can theoretically get 
unlimited points. Use the 
yellow guy's boomerang. Lead 
one yellow guy in such a way 
that he gets stuck at an
object 
(fire hydrant or barrel) 
between you and him, aligned 
horizontally. He will try to 
move toward you, but he won't 
be able to move since the 
object is near him. Get close 
enough to him so that he 
starts throwing boomerangs. 
You can kill each one for 
(wow!) 1 point. I got 4000 
points on this game, which is 
pretty good considering most 
people make it to the end with 
only 350 or so.


In the sewer level, stand just 
below the ledge in the middle 
of the screen. Then jump 
straight up. You will land 
just on the edge of the upper 
level. Nothing can hurt you 
for the rest of that level, 
but you can kill anything that 
comes close enough to you. 
(You can't move up or down 
though, or you'll have to 
repeat this trick).


In the sewer level, you can 
keep from getting hit by 
walking right along the edge 
of the brick floor. This 
prevents enemies from
attacking
you from multiple directions. 
You still need to nail enemies 
directly in front of you or 
behind you. This is easy with 
Donatello.


Killing most bosses consist of 
3 strategies. They all consist 
of moving vertically towards 
the bosses.


1: Move vertically upwards, 
hit the boss, and move 
vertically downwards. Repeat
until dead. Works well on 
Bebop.


2: Wait for the boss to move 
vertically down towards you, 
wait for him, hit him, and 
move vertically upwards. 
Repeat until he's dead. Works 
best on Rocksteady. Best 
results occur when you hit and 
run at the same time.


3: Wait for the boss to move 
vertically towards you. Jump 
over him, move through him 
and attack as you do this, 
keep moving. Repeat. Works 
well on the big robots.


By the way, if you're in (or 
from) the UK, you might 
remember this game as 
"Teenage Mutant Hero 
Turtles".

Designed and programmed
by Dave Theurer                    


The first game to use Color-
Quadrascan and Skill-Step,
both features unique to Atari
vector games.


Tempest was originally
a 3-D Space Invaders clone 
called "Vortex", but was 
changed when the other 
engineers didn't come back to 
play the game. This was kind 
of a test for an Atari game;  
if the engineers kept coming 
back to play a new game, it 
was considered a hit. The 
first prototype of the game 
had the shape wireframe 
spinning and the gunner 
remaining stationary, but 
that caused motion sickness
after a period of time so it 
was changed around. The design
for Tempest came to Theurer
in a dream; of a hole in the
ground with monsters
crawling out of it and him
trying to stop them. 


Tempest sold 20,000 units
to distributors before it
was even released.


Tips and Tricks:


These are cheats that were 
apparently left in by somebody 
at Atari. They were removed in 
ROM 217 and 222 Software 
Revision 2. (NOTE: According
to
Dave Theurer, the game's 
designer, these "cheats" were
actually a sort of copy 
protection scheme. Due to 
some changes in the game's 
code before production, the
protection was triggered and
these "cheats" were made
available. See 
http://208.17.150.196/arcade/
for an explanation from the
designer himself.)

Get a score with the format 
XXYYZZ:

XX must be greater than 16,

YY between 29 and 60, and

ZZ is a code listed below.

Codes for ZZ are as follows:

00 - freeze screen

01 - access bookkeeping totals

05 - play during attract mode

06 - 40 credits

11 - 40 credits

12 - 40 credits

14 - credit sound without
actual credit

15 - credit sound without 
actual credit

16 - 40 credits

17 - 40 credits

18 - 40 credits 

41 - switch last 2 digits of 
score 

42 - increase score quickly 

46 - demonstration mode - 
start at any level, up to 
level 81

50 - player moves by itself

51 - player moves by itself 

60 - objects drift down 

66 - objects drift right 

67 - objects jump 

68 - objects drift up 

70 - objects drift up


After code "05" (play during 
attract mode) is activated, 
the following cheats become 
available:

Set the last two digits to 46: 
Random-colored level with 
wrong enemies

Set the last two digits to 48: 
255 extra lives

It is possible to get an extra
1000 points bonus when
shooting skeletons which
appear after killing
dinosaurs.
If you have the proper
back-firing weapon, fire at
the skeleton and a sprite
should appear flying to the
top. Shoot it to get the
bonus. Remember, you
cant get this bonus with

Easter Egg: 
There is a 10,000 points bonus
in the start of the game.
Count
your shots until arriving at
the
first railroad. If counting 48
shots, a little car should
enter
the screen on the right side.
Destroy it with the 49th shot
to get the bonus. There are
similar cars throughout the
game, but making them 
appear is a mystery.



Tips and Tricks:


Near the beginning there is a 
"school house" with a red drum 
on the top. If you hit the red 
drum enough times, you'll get
a 10,000 point bonus.


Blast everything. Civilian
cars 
and houses, etc., all give 50 
points each.


Be sure to blast the diamond 
shape that appears and 
disappears. If you hit it 
enough there is a decent 
suprise (such as a free man).
[Any more info? --Roger]


If you see the race car zip 
by, tag it with your guns for 
10,000 points.

Designed by Yoshiki Okamoto

Character by Hideki Ooyama

Sound by Mashahiro Inoue


Yoshiki was told to design
a driving game. When he 
learned of the game's 
concept, he balked at
making it, and started on
Time Pilot. As development
continued, Okamoto showed 
his boss design docs for 
the driving game, all the
while working on Time Pilot.
Although his boss told him
to do the driving game
instead, he tried to take
the credit for Time Pilot.
Okamoto decided not to
disgrace his boss and let
the episode go!!


Tips and Tricks:


Here's one way (although a 
boring one) to get a great 
Time Pilot score:


1. Finish the first stage as 
soon as possible


2. On the second stage, don't 
shoot anything!! Eventually, 
parachutes will start to 
appear. Collect the 
parachutes while avoiding the 
planes. Each parachute (after 
#4) will give you 5,000
points.
It's possible to roll the 
machine over (999,999+ points) 
while remaining on level 2 
using this strategy.

By the way, while using this
cheat you can also shoot the
1500 point bombers without 
causing the time bar to be 
shortened.

Tips and Tricks:


On the first level, head 
directly to the right. After a
couple of screens, you'll see 
an unusual "V" formation of 
silver ships that resemble 
craft in Time Pilot 1, heading 
up or down. This easy-to-kill
formation gives you 8,000 
points, a good start to the 
game.


The biplane from the original 
Time Pilot makes a cameo 
appearance in TP84. To find
it, 
fly right to the water and 
harbor area. Then turn 
vertically up the screen. When 
the biplane appears (over 
water), hit it with a missile, 
and you are rewarded with a 
free player! 


This game contains many
bonuses, 
hidden and otherwise. Here is
a 
semi-complete scoring table:

 
Green enemy: 100 pts


Silver enemy on ground 
w/missile: 200 pts


Silver enemy w/missile: 500 
pts


Missile carrier: 1,000 pts

(as did many Atari games :) 
in which there was a motorized
waterfall attached to the top
of the marquee. When this neat
gadget failed, it made a 
horrible grinding noise that
could be heard behind closed
oak doors!!


Very much an Atari Games
concept.
Makes you wonder what kinds of 
drugs these guys were on!!!


Tips and Tricks:


In only a minute or so, 
there's a way you can rack up 
over a million points:


On Class 1, after going 
towards the first gate, direct 
your innertube to the right 
side of the screen. A sign 
should say "This Way to Class 
2" and a whirlpool should 
appear next to it. Shoot the 
twigs in front of the
entrance, 
and paddle back up. You will 
now be at the start of Class 
2.

Right away, move to the right 
of the screen... the same sign 
will appear, only it'll warp 
you to Class 3. Shoot the 
iceberg in front, paddle back 
up, and end up on class 3.

The best part about the warps 
is that after each one, you 
get 600,000 points each! 
That's 1,200,000+ without 
barely doing anything! And you 
have 4 patches left in reserve 
thanks to your excess points!


Picking up a six-pack gives 
you unlimited cans, until you 
lose your life. A beach ball 
speeds you and your cans up.

Since the six-pack gives 
unlimited cans, you can take 
advantage of it by placing 
your character in a little 
crevice right next to a bad 
guy on shore and fire away. 
You're able to shoot very fast 
since you're very close. It is 
a very good way to rack up 
points and extra lives.


Always try to go through the 
gates you encounter in the 
river without touching the 
poles. This'll increase your 
score multiplier (up to 5X).


Be sure to shoot as many twigs 
and other obstacles as you can 
(get the six-pack for this), 
because there are hidden 
letters and extra lives in 
them. Catch the letters for 
extra points given at the end 
of the level.


To be able to turn *fast*, 
alternately press buttons on 
the corners, e.g.
......1.........2

.........3...4


Use 1-4-1, or 2-3-2, this'll 
greatly improve your playing.


Pick up letters whenever 
possible, and make sure your 
multiplier is high at the end 
of the board, for maximum 
points.


Whenever you see mines, if you 
can get to the left side of it 
and turn so that you face it, 
you can shoot as many times as
you like in rapid succession 
(hitting the mine rapidly), 
you can continue to cause 
explosions going up to the 
right wall. Most of the time, 
a prize of some sort will 
result along that path. 
Sometimes patches, sometimes 
beach balls, etc.


This is yet another game with 
a T-Shirt offer.

Tricks and Tips for Playing
TOP GUNNER:


The name of the game is
POWERUPS. Your success in
this game will depend soley
on your ability to obtain and
KEEP powerups.Your jeep is
equipped with two weapons: a
machine gun (always shoots up
in TG) and a rocket type
weapon that shoots the
direction you are facing and
can be'boosted' in various
ways and usually in steps or
levels of powerup. The
default level is short range
rocket. Will stop and destroy
many buildings and all
vehicles.


Here are the levels
of powerup you can obtain for
your rocket weapon: Short
Range Rocket (default) -
shoots a short range rocket.
Long Range Rocket - shoots a
long range rocket (almost the
entire length of the screen)
Horizontal Exploding Rocket
- same as above but the rocket
explodes in two directions
horizontally, taking out
anything the schrapnel hits.
Diagonal Exploding Rocket -
same as above but the rocket
explodes in 4 directions
diagonally, taking out
anything the schrapnel hits.


There are a couple of ways
of boosting your rocket
weapon. The assumed way is
to blow up the special
bunkers that have a single
gun turret and a single POW
-picking up the POW will
give you a nice points bonus
as well as a POWERUP to the
next level of rocket weapon.
These bunkers are available
every so often - butyou will
need a little something
extra to get farther in the
game. You need to get full
powerup quickly - and this
is how you do it. A
diversion in the game (not
required to actually finish
it) is to shoot open bunkers
and pick up POWs - this is
above and beyond the single
POW bunkers you can snag guys
from. Your jeep can handle a
total of 8 POWs. First trick
-NEVER fill your jeep to
capacity - always leave a
single slot open. If you fill
your jeep up and run across a
single 'power up' bunker, you
won't be able to pick the POW
up and get your powerup. Now,
just before you get to the
helicopter pad (to release the
POWs), you will almost ALWAYS
find a bunker with a single
powerup POW. Blow it up, get
the POW ,the powerup, and that
will fill your jeep to
capacity. YOU WANT YOUR JEEP
FULL BEFORE STOPPING AT THE
CHOPPER PAD. Clear the area of
enemies around the pad (you
don't want any suprise enemies
popping up and making you
move) then park and start
releasing the POWs. DO NOT
MOVE UNTIL THE LAST MAN IS
AWAY. Once all eight are out
of the jeep, you can get the
heck out of there (chances
are, you will being stalked
or about to be killed) You
will receive a great bonus
of points and FULL POWERUP on
your rocket weapon! Talk about
tilting the odds in your
favor! You can do this EACH
and EVERY time you are at a
helicopter pad! This will earn
you HUGE scores and keep your
weapon up to snuff.


Remember,
every time you die, you lose
ONE level of powerup - so
aside from the understood
incentive for staying alive,
you want to also maintain your
weapon. Best of all - YOU GET
A HUGE BONUS for picking up
the powerup POWs when you are
at full rocket weapon
strength. If you want to see
your score skyrocket, get full
powerup and start plucking
those powerup POWs up. Later
in the game, you will need to
strategically stop on the
helicopter pad to allow
yourself to shoot up and to a
left angle to shoot down
bomber planes that will
DEFINATELY start showing up.
If you can kill them the
second they appear on the
screen, none of their bombs
will hurt you. If you miss
lining up the jeep right, or
you miss the plane, you will
HAVE to move before the last
guy gets out of the jeep or
die. It takes some practice
(you can't "reposition" the
jeep after the first man gets
out or you lose the bonus)
but you'll get to be a pro in
no time. Enemies are not
random in this game, so you
can learn where tanks and
enemy jeep vehicles reside
quite quickly. While it sounds
like a 'duh' tip, keep the
enemy count low - especially
enemy soldiers on foot. While
they are little more than an
annoyance at the beginning of
the game, they QUICKLY become
formidable enemies and keeping
the number of them 'on screen'
to a minimum is a requirement.
The enemy subs can be killed
before they are all the way
out of the water as well as
while they are going back in
(i.e. when they aren't
firing). Learn their location
and plant rockets in the water
before they have a chance to
fire on you. In a two player
game, have the player NOT
offloading POWs to the
helicopter 'stand guard'
against the bomber planes (and
other enemies for that
matter). Then swap off and let
the other one offload. Enemies
are still 'active' hidden
partially off screen (but they
don't move or fire). Use this
to kill enemies before they
take a stance against you (the
big tanks especially). Most
vehicles can be killed with
enough shots from your machine
gun. If you don't feel you can
reposition yourself in time to
line up your rocket, pound
away with bullets and hope you
kill him first.

Tips and Tricks:


When you get to the javelin 
throw, run fast and then hold 
the angle button down, making 
the javelin soar high into 
the air. If it gets high 
enough, it'll hit a bird, 
which will fall and give you 
1000 points. 


Another hidden bonus: On the 
high jump level, fail the
first 
two jumps on purpose (knock
the 
bar off). On the 3rd attempt, 
clear the bar and a mole pops 
his head up through the ground 
and you get 1000 bonus points.


Some tips for each event:


100m Dash: When playing in 2-
player mode, a tie gives each 
player 1000 bonus points.


Long Jump: Jumping from the 
exact center of the line gives 
a speed boost of 100. Jumping 
while touching any other part 
of the line gives a speed
boost of 50.


Javelin Throw: 42 degrees is 
the best angle.


110m Hurdles: As in the 100m 
dash, a tie between two 
players gives a 1000-point 
bonus.


Here's a two-player hurdles 
cheat (works only on some 
machines): Have one person win 
the race normally. The other
player should take his time. 
After 40 seconds, the clock 
stops running down. Use a 
watch to ensure a 100+ second 
finish time. The + is how many 
seconds you get credited for.


Hammer Throw: Perfect throw 
will have 1500 speed, 45 
degree angle. 99.99 meter 
throw most of the time.


High Jump: Note that hitting 
the buttons, even after you 
have jumped, really helps. Be 
sure to tap the jump button to 
ease yourself over the top, 
not hold the button down.
Also, 
If you foul the first two
jumps 
and nail the third, you get a 
1000-pt. bonus.

#Triple Punch
$info=triplep
$icon=triplep
$data
$bio
Tips and Tricks:


Begin by filling in the box in 
the lower left-hand corner. 
Once you've done that, fill in 
the two boxes (vertically) to 
its right, then the three to 
their right, and so on until 
you've effectively wrapped 
around the playfield and are 
back at the first box you 
filled in. Just repeat this 
motion until all of the boxes 
are full.


Also remember that real points 
are to be gained not by
filling 
in two boxes at once, but by 
punching out an enemy while
the 
ambulance is still on-screen 
taking away another enemy. 
Doing this gives you 600
points 
as compared to the usual 300, 
or 150-200 for filling two 
boxes simultaneously.

#Trog
$info=trog,trog3
$icon=trog
$data
$bio
Tips and Tricks:


Watch the corner of the screen 
opposite from where you start. 
At the beginning of each wave 
except #1, one of your eggs
will sparkle for a second. Get 
this egg last, and without 
dying. If you do, a pit with
white squares in it will open 
up somewhere on the board.
Fall 
down this pit rather than
going 
home, and you will warp ahead
3 
levels and get a bonus of 
300,000 pts. (Well, actually, 
everyone gets the bonus pts.)

Every player has his own warp 
egg. Only one player has to 
get the egg last without dying 
to activate the warp. On the
levels with the striped eggs, 
the color of the sparkle 
distinguishes the warp eggs.

The warp will take you forward 
3 or 2 levels, often 3, but 
sometimes 2. It's
deterministic; 
island X will always warp to
island Y, so it's possible to 
figure an optimal warp path.

Walt Disney Productions
charges Williams Electronics
for copyright and patent
infringement regarding
Williams
use of "tron" in Robotron.
Williams wins the suit and
Disney goes on to hire
Bally/Midway to create video
games based on their movie. 


Tron was originally slated
to be a color vector game.
It was designed using an 
early script of the movie.
Basically, the team took
various challenges Flynn
had to go through and made
them into four separate 
games-within-a-game. Three
of the four scenes were 
either changed or removed
from the final cut of the
movie, but it still made 
one hell of an awesome 
game.

General Tips:


TANKS: hide behind corners and 
use them for cover when you 
shoot. Also, use the 
transporter in the center as 
cover. You can shoot clear 
through the transporter and
out 
the other side and zap the 
computer. Don't use the 
transporter except for a 
desperation tactic. It will 
more than likely dump you
right 
in the computer's gunsight(s).


SPIDERS: Fire in a constant 
spread and just hose 'em down 
from side to side. Gradually 
move in a constant arc up to 
the entrance. Stay just 
outside the entrance and hose 
the spiders above and below 
until time runs out. Enjoy the 
music.


MCP CONE: Move up so you're 
just underneath the rotating 
cone and on the right side. 
Shoot the blocks nearest to 
you.  This gives you another 
shot more quickly than
shooting 
blocks farther away. When you 
get a gap, move up and fire 
away due left. Above all,
don't 
hang around and get caught : 
if the going gets tough, move
on up and into the cone. Don't 
forget to twirl the knob as
you 
rise. (You'll see if you do
it)


LIGHT CYCLES: Use a question 
mark type shape for the first 
board. The Computer will run 
right into it. For the harder 
boards, try to trap them
either 
near the center tracks or 
against the wall. This is, by 
far, the hardest thing to do.

The first few boards are
unique, 
but the events of the game 
eventually repeat, two with
one 
order and the other two with 
another. I believe that the 
Light Cycles and Tanks have 
order 6, the Grid Bugs and 
Cones order 5. For the Light 
Cycles you can develop 
patterns, for the Tanks you 
can do the same (the basis for 
all of my patterns involved 
immediately going up, to the 
right, and hiding halfway in 
and out of the teleporter). 
The Grid Bugs and Cones also 
have somewhat looser patterns, 
and for some of these boards 
you have to spin the
controller 
*before* the board actually 
starts in order to have the 
gun positioned properly to 
shoot a bug/cone section and 
move (otherwise it is instant 
death).

If you shoot ALL the bugs, the 
level ends, and drags you up 
and through the tower no
matter 
where you are on the board.


This is an interesting bug. On 
the MCP Cone levels, if you go 
all the way to the right or 
the left and keep moving, you 
can move the whole playfield 
to the side. This doesn't seem 
to have any other affect, but 
it is kinda fun to see. 


Here's an odd Tron bug:


On the Recognizer Tank levels, 
make your way to one of the 
little alcoves in either the 
top right, or bottom left 
corners. The tanks cannot 
shoot, and will not go down an 
alcove, so therefore cannot 
kill you. Then, wait 
approximately 9 to 10 minutes 
without moving your tank. You 
can fire, but do not kill all 
the recognizers.

After the time (9-10 mins),
the 
sound system will go berserk, 
starting with a very high 
pitch tone, which falls to a 
low tone that vibrates the 
cabinet.

The sound also goes berserk if 
you enter the tower at 0099 
units on the bug screen. (This 
is reported to be 
unreproducible in MAME.)

Fabio Rossi, in his
'Dizionario Dei Videogame',
claims that the game was
originally to be called
'Tutankhamon'. However,
when programmers decided
to change the monitor position
from horizontal to vertical,
they had to cut the -ON suffix
from "Tutankhamon" to make
the title fit the screen
width.
Rossi reports this anecdote to
stress the lack of marketing
strategies in the early years
of VGs, when a game's name
could be determined by simple
technical considerations.

Tips and Tricks:


Venture

by Tom Hirschfeld (1981)

               


CONTROLS

a. Eight-directional joystick

b. Fire button



SCORING

a. Hall Monster: Low score

b. Dungeon Monster: medium 
score 

c. Dungeon treasure: high 
score

d. Extra bow after clearing 
Level Two



DANGERS


a. Touching any hall monster 
or dungeon monster, or being
crushed or otherwise done in, 
causes immediate death to 
Winky, the heroic archer 
controlled by the player.



OBSERVATIONS


a. As in several other maze 
games, the joystick directs 
motion and shooting; whenever 
the player shifts his bow to a 
new direction, he begins to 
move that way as well.


b. Hall monsters wander
outside 
the dungeons, starting slowly. 
Shooting one will not destroy 
it, so the only way to escape 
them as they home in is to 
evade them.


c. To keep a treasure, Winky 
must leave the dungeon with 
it. If he is killed before he 
can, the treasure reverts to 
its original place and all
dead monsters in the dungeon 
are revived. Except for the 
points Winky earned during his 
first time in it is as though 
he held never been there.

Once he does clear the
dungeon, 
It becomes solid on the large 
map, and he cannot go back in. 
Once all the dungeons of a 
level have been looted, Winky 
climbs down to the next level.


d. Whenever Winky is killed 
and reborn, he takes a new bow 
and tramps five steps down a 
staircase to the bottom of 
whatever level he is at, 
slightly left of center. If he
has looted the level at all, 
those chambers are still solid 
in the overhead view. Hall 
monsters then begin to 
materialize and start tracking 
him within two seconds.


e. After Winky has been in one 
dungeon for a maximum of ten 
seconds, a hall monster begins 
to materialize just outside. 
Once it has grown to full
size, 
a process of about two
seconds, 
it makes a beeline for Winky, 
passing straight through 
whatever walls or monsters lie 
in its path.

If Winky leaves when he sees a 
hall monster outside, the 
monster will rarely be there 
when he gets out.


f. Whenever Winky leaves a 
dungeon and then reenters it, 
whatever monsters he has 
killed inside are alive again. 
If he left to flee a has 
monster, furthermore, the
monster will begin to re 
materialize right away. The 
longer Winky takes going in 
and out, the more hall
monsters 
will be waiting for him
outside 
when he finally leaves.


g. Occasionally, a hall
monster 
is waiting just outside a 
dungeon door,and Winky doesn't 
have a chance.


h. Each dungeon monster,dead 
or alive, is deadly to touch. 
Corpses disintegrate slowly, 
and even the last dot of color 
will kill Winky if he touches 
it.


i.Shooting a disintegrating 
corpse does not hasten its 
disappearance: rather,it 
reconstitutes the body,as 
though the monster has been 
freshly killed.

Dungeon monsters often seem to 
sense when Winky is aiming at 
them, and they move out of his 
line of fire. To shoot them, 
he must move, aim, and fire 
quickly.

It is often possible to obtain 
and keep a treasure just by 
dodging the monsters, thus 
saving the time it would take 
to kill them.


j.With the completion of each 
level, his total score is 
increased by the number of 
points Winky earned while 
there multiplied by a one-
digit number displayed just
under the title over the map 
of the level. If he gained 
1,000 points in the first 
level, for example, they 
might be multiplied by 7, 
making his overall score 
8,000.

The more time Winky takes to 
finish the level, the smaller 
the bonus multiplier becomes.


k. There are too many 
dungeons to give a detailed 
description of each one, but 
here are previews of the first
two levels. The most useful to
know.

l. Level One, top left (The
Wall Room): The easiest of the
dungeons. Four red walls
slowly move in and out:there
is a diamond in the center.
Winky can touch the
walls and survive, as long as
he doesn't let them crush him
against any of the dungeon
walls.

If he waits until the top or
bottom wall has come as far
from the center as it can, he
can scoot in,grab the diamond
and leave the way he came.
Shooting a hole in a
wall clears a more direct
path, but it earns him no
points and consumes valuable
time.

m. Level One, top right (The
Serpent Room): The three green
ú snakes are guarding a magic
apple.They always remain
horizontal and do not move
very fast or
dangerously so dodging or
shooting them is not
difficult. If Winky enters
through the door in the
right-hand wall, only two
snakes are wriggling between
him and the
apple. If he enters through
the other door, he must face
all three.

n. Level One, bottom left and
bottom right (The Goblin Room
and The Skeleton Room); The
three monsters in each of
these dungeons are not
particularly hard to
deal with, although killing
them takes more time than
simply escaping with the
treasures. Once the player
knows how they move, they
should not present much of a
challenge either way.

o. Level Two, top left (The
Two-Headed Room): This
Y-shaped dungeon seems empty
as Winky enters but,as soon as
he touches the treasure at the
bottom, four
deadly crabs appear two
blocking each exit. If Winky
shoots one, its corpse might
block his path to freedom when
the hall monster enters.

p. Level Two, top right (The
Troll Room): When Winky enters
this dungeon, walls stand
between him and the two angry
trolls who guard their
treasure. After about
three seconds, though, three
large gaps appear in the
barrier, permitting the trolls
to charge through. They are
the most evasive Level Two
monsters.

q. Level Two, center (The
Dragon Room): The four large
dragons in this room are
fairly easy marks, but once
they die, their corpses often
block Winky's path to the
treasure at the apex of the
triangle and back to his one
exit in its base. A hall
monster is bound to enter
before he can leave.

r. Level Two, bottom (The
Spider Room): The three red
spiders are fast and hard to
hit, but they as not the
dungeon's greatest threat:
once Winky has managed t0
obtain the chamber`s treasure,
a dancer statuette, all three
spiders, alive and dead,
vanish only to be replaced by
two faster, deadlier, yellow
spiders, one on each
side of poor Winky.

s. The next level features
such attractions as The Demon
Room, The Genie Room. The Bat
Room, and The Cyclops Room,
each challenging in its own
way. In later
levels:

1. The point values and
bonuses Increase.

2. The dungeons become more
difficult

3. The hall monsters move
faster.



STRATEGIES

a. If you wont to change aim
without moving, learn just to
tap the joystick, not to jam
it.

b. When pursued by hall
monsters outside the dungeons,
don`t waste time by shooting
them. Reverse direction,
switch from side to side, and
do whatever else you
must to escape.

c. Do your best not to shoot a
monster where its corpse might
block your path to or from the
treasure. If you do, you have
no choice but to wait until it
has
completely disintegrated;
under no circumstances should
you shoot it again.

d. Because you want to get out
of each dungeon quickly, you
should waste no time in
picking up the treasure. It
can and should be done in one
fluid motion. The
Instant you touch the loot,
you should start thinking
about getting out.

e. When a hall monster appears
outside a dungeon, leave. Even
if it is outside the room's
only exit, remember that it
won't be there when you get
outside-although
another might.

Once the half monster has
actually entered the dungeon,
the best policy is to flee in
the opposite direction. If
there is no exit there or a
corpse is blocking it, it is
still
possible in the first three
levels for a skillful Winky to
escape around the hall
monster. It's a risk but do it
if you have to.

f. When leaving a dungeon,
look out. You don't want to
run straight into a waiting
hall monster. The more time
you've spent in the level so
far,the more you should
worry.

g. The question of whether to
shoot dungeon monsters when
you don't absolutely have to
depends on two factors: speed
and accuracy. If you think you
can kill
several in a short time,do it.
Keep in mind the bonus at the
end of each level, since that
determines your final score.
Unless you are very fast,
there is no point in
risking the decrease of your
score by a seventh or a sixth
for a few hundred points.

h. Since you Start in the same
place on the level each time,
it makes sense to clear the
dungeons nearest you first. If
you can make a circuit of the
level without being
killed,the strategy will save
time. If you are killed and
have to start over,you will
have to take the same long
route you avoided before.

i. In The Wall Room, don't
bother shooting your way
through the red walls. It's a
risk that earns you no points
and takes more time than
simply slipping around them.
Since this dungeon Is the
easiest, it should probably be
saved for last, when you need
to finish quickly.

j. In The Serpent Room, send
arrows down on the two lower
snakes before you enter their
territory. Their length will
make them easy targets from
that angle.

If pressed for time enter and
exit the dungeon through the
door in the right wail,
avoiding a confrontation with
the third snake.

k. The Goblin and Skeleton
Rooms should be handled
according to your inclination.
You can easily evade the
monsters, but the points you
could gain with a few
parting shots should be
considered.

i. Save The Two-Headed Room
for the end of Level Two,
since it is a very quick job
once you have the secret. When
you don't have time to shoot
the crabs and
then to wait for them to
disintegrate from your path,
split-second timing alone will
get you out safely. The
instant you touch the
treasure,jam the joystick to
the upper
left. Each time, you will
barely make it past the crabs
and out the left head of the
room.

A more lucrative and
time-consuming method is to
stay at the bottom with your
treasure and wait for the
crabs to drift down from the
heads into the body in search
of you, as they invariably do.
If you shoot well, you can
kill them and still leave a
clear path out. If a hall
monster appears before you
finish though, say goodbye to
Winky.

m. As soon as you enter The
Troll Room, move about an inch
to the left of the entrance,
staying as low as possible:
aim to the upper right. As
soon as the walls
vanish, one goblin will come
thundering down since he
doesn't sense that you're
aiming at him. Diagonal shots
are your best chance against
any of the monsters,but
the trolls are particularly
tricky.

Shoot as soon as he leaves
cover, then move up and get
the treasure. The remaining
troll will not be had to evade
If you are fast.

Whenever you do aim vertically
or horizontally,the trolls
will not give you a chance to
hit them, holding you in
stalemate until the hall
monster shows up. What you
must do ( if you don't want to
shoot diagonally) is aim in
some other direction until
your target has committed
himself to attack. Then
quickly shift your aim and
fire
before he has a chance to
dodge.

n. You must kill almost
everything in The Dragon Room;
there is no room to maneuver
around the dragons while they
are all alive and moving. Even
if you are a
skillful archer, you must take
special care to shoot so that
you still have a clear path to
and from the treasure. If you
have to wait for the dragons
to disintegrate
before you can reach it, you
might as well forget about it. 

o. The red denizens of The
Spider Room win always stay
near the treasure in the
center; they shift around it
to follow you. Shoot one for
best results: it takes almost
no time and you can easily
snatch the treasure from only
two defenders.

The instant you do, look out
for the two yellow spiders.
They will close in on you
rapidly,and your only chance
is to duck under one and
escape while you still have
time. Once you reach the door,
a couple of arrows shot at
your pursuers won`t hurt.

p. With each new level, be
prepared for greater and
greater challenges. Try to
view each dungeon creatively
to find the best strategy.

VENTURE is one game in which
it is not only important but
vital to watch more
experienced players, observing
the game`s many unusual
problems and the different
ways of handling them. Good
luck!

Tips and Tricks:


About the Game Play


The game of Warlords is
amazingly simple. Easy to
learn, yet hard to
master.


The game is basically a
suped-up version of PONG with
a twist. There are
four castles. One in each
corner of the screen. Players
(Warlords) have
little crowns in the center of
their castles and the computer
players have
little black evil looking
Black Knights. Surrounding
your castle on your
two vulnerable sides is your
castle's wall. This is about
an inch thick and
has the standard castle wall
look to it with buttresses.
Each castle's
courtyard is a different
colour as is it's wall.
Besides your castles walls
you have one more item for
your defense. Your shield.
It's a little shield
shaped thing with a yellow +
and it's background colour is
the same as your
courtyard. The only other
graphic item (Excluding the
Dragon) is the
fireball. Your weapon and your
nemesis. You use this fireball
to blast
chunks of wall out of your
opponents to create a hole
that you can send
your enemy to a blazing death.
The winner is the one left
standing at the
end of a round. You control
your shield with a rotating
control knob. Your
shield moves with it from left
to right and back. The control
knob does,
however, only move so far to
the left and right before it
stops. The
control is read on the
position of the control and
not how far it has
traveled. Therefore you can
move the knob so fast as to
have your shield
vanish and pop into your new
spot making for some very
fast, timed moves.


There are 3 modes of play for
the Cocktail version of
Warlords.


One player Game


The one player game involves
the player playing against the
three
computer controlled opponents
called Black Knights. In this
mode of
play you select your castle
out of the four available and
press your start
button. (It will remain lit) A
countdown will start (from 9
to 0) waiting
for other players to join in.
During the countdown a dragon
will appear and
walk around opening it's mouth
and making a fire breathing
sound.


When the countdown (with a
drum like sound as it ticks)
expires the game
begins. The dragon will walk
to the center of the screen
and stop. It will
turn it's head a few times and
seemingly randomly spit out a
fireball at
one of the castles. (With the
fireball sound) The dragon
vanishes as the
fireball flies towards one of
the castles. If you were quick
and or
prepared for such an attack
you can position your shield
to block the shot.
The fireball bounces off
either your shield or your
castle's wall (taking a
little bite out of it in the
process). You can grab onto
the fireball with
your shield by being directly
under the fireball when it
comes at you while
holding down the start button.
This will cause the fireball
to spin very
quickly on your shield
spitting out little bits of
fire as it goes around.
If you hold onto this for too
long it will start damaging
your castle's
walls! You can then redirect
the fireball's trajectory by
moving your
control knob and then
releasing your start button.
This causes the fireball
to blast from your shield at a
high rate of speed and if it
impacts into a
castle's wall it takes a HUGE
chunk out of it. About 4x the
standard chunk.
If your opponent manages to
block your blast it will
careen off
their shield at an angle and
will continue at it's high
rate of destructive
speed until it impacts with a
wall. (Even yours!) A player
or computer
controlled Black Knight dies
when their wall has been eaten
though and a
fireball enters the courtyard.
There is a blinding flash as
the castle
explodes (With a great
explosion sound. 8^) ) and a
second fireball flies
from the destruction. There
can be up to four fireballs in
play at one
time. This makes for a wild
and hairy game! Besides extra
fireballs being
released into play on the
death of a castle you can also
get extra
fireballs by being too slow in
destruction. If the game feels
you are too
good, it will bring extra
fireballs into the game. They
will appear in the
center of the screen and
slowly drift toward a castle.


If you survive the round (you
are the one left standing) you
go onto the
next level, with much smarter
computer opponents. (They seem
to get
exponentially harder on each
successive level) You also get
a brand new
castle with new walls.


Scoring is based on the
following format. (one & two
player games)
125 = Damaging a castle wall
(even yours I believe)

1000 = Destroying any Warlord
(any Human player)

2500 = Destroying any Black
Knight (any Computer player)

5000 x level = Surviving
player gains 5000 points x
current level


The game is over when the
human player has been
destroyed. If the player
has beaten the current high
score the player can enter in
their initials
with their score.
They are listed as the high
score for 1 player mode.



Two player Game


The two player game is exactly
the same as the one player
game
except:


In two player mode two human
players select any castle
position. The
counter ticks down and play
begins. Except in this mode it
is recommended
that the two human players
play as a team both taking out
the Black
Knights. Once the computer
controlled players have been
destroyed, however,
it's a free for all for the
end of level points. (See the
one player
scoring list) The surviving
warlords (providing they were
not killed during
the round by the computer or
human players) fight it out
for the 5000xlevel
+ 1000 Warlord bonus. Once
there is only one human left,
you both start out
on the next level (with much
harder opponents) with all new
castles and
walls. The game is over when
both human players have died.
If the players
combined score is greater then

Tips and Tricks:


This game has hidden coins
that appear when you jump in
certain spots. The demo screen
shows a couple of these. Some
of
them will give you 60 gold or
more every time.


On the screen after you kill
the vampire and get the broad
sword, there are some
platforms that contain a shoe
shop and a
cure shop. There are stairs
leading down to the cure shop,
and there's a little
mushroom-type guy. Wait for
him to go down the
stairs, and then stand so that
you're almost off the topmost
stair. He'll come back up and
hit you, making you fall off
the stairs.
Hold the joystick to the left
so that when you land you walk
into the bottom step. This
will drop a 60+ coin.


On the stage just after you
kill the red knight, you'll
see some little jellyfish-type
things on platforms over the
water. At the first
jellyfish you come to, wait
for him to drop into the
water, and then stand at the
very edge of the platform
(halfway off) and let
him hit you. You'll take a
small amount of damage, but
you'll get a large amount of
cash.


Jump for coins all over the
place - you never know what
you'll find!

#WWF Superstars

Tips and Tricks:


An excellent WWF Superstars
strategy guide by Andre
Vieira:


Character Selection- most
people like to select Randy
Savage and the Big Boss Man
(size and speed). My
preference leaned
more towards Hulk Hogan and
Randy Savage. The good
characters to me were Jim
Duggan, the Boss Man, Savage
and Hogan
because of their special moves
and high kicks. 


A good tip/strategy when
starting is to rush the
opposing tag team with a
flying kick to knock them BOTH
down. If this was timed
right, especially on the
earlier levels, you could wear
down both players before the
first computer opponent could
wrestle you
one-on-one. Here's how it
works. The ring announcer is
introducing the wrestlers.
Your wrestler closest to the
center of the ring
(lower wrestler) charges their
lower wrestler, knocking him
down. The computer's upper
wrestler that starts the match
will come
down beside him, also getting
knocked down in the process.
You go after the opponent who
is NOT the legal man in the
ring,
and throw him into the other
wrestler. If all goes well,
you can knock down each
opponent in turn, or both
simultaneously until
you get knocked down or the
third man in the ring leaves.


My pattern for victory would
be to grab my opponent,
bodyslam him, pick him up,
throw him to the ropes and
clothesline him.
He will get up, but be out of
breath. At that point, I would
get behind him and deliver a
suplex/atomic drop. Wait until
he is out
of breath and give another
suplex/atomic drop, then when
he gets up a third time,
clothesline him. He will then
try to tag his
partner, but I try to
intercept him and throw him
towards my side of the ring
and give him a flying
dropkick. After that, I pin
him
and let my partner deal with
his partner.


You should always try to pin
the computer opponent near
your side of the ring so that
when his partner rushes to
help, you can
flip him out of the ring using
your partner. It also cuts
down the computer's chances of
breaking up the pin. A neat
bug that
happened VERY rarely was to
have both computer opponents
down on health after beating
them silly (using the opening
trick
outlined above) then throwing
the legal man out of the ring.
If the computer has been
pounded sufficiently, you can
pin the
computer's partner while the
legal man lies motionless
outside the ring. You won't
get the three count for the
pin, but your
partner will enter the ring
and you can start him running
until he is halfway across and
make him jump into a flying
bodyslam
onto the prone opponent
outside the ring. The clock
goes until 20, at which point
the computer is counted out.
That gives your
second guy time for one or two
more bodyslams since after he
lands the first one, he
automatically travels back to
his corner.


If both your players are
running low on health, a good
strategy is to leave the ring,
hoping to lure the computer
opponent
outside. That way, you have a
chance to knock his energy
down a bit and possibly count
him out of the ring. If he
does not
come out for you, move towards
your side of the ring near the
turnbuckle. The computer will
follow you there, and if you
move
a bit towards the right a bit,
the computer will be close to
the ropes but facing you
still. Eventually your partner
will come down
and grab him while he is still
facing you. You can come back
into the ring and beat him up
a bit, giving you time to tag
up or
exit the ring to lure him
again.


In the championship match
against Andre the Giant and
Ted Dibiasi, I like to use the
rushing tactic outlined above.
If the Giant
is slated to start the match,
you may have time to throw
Dibiasi out of the ring, and
throw the Giant into the ropes
for an
eventual back drop or drop
kick. If Dibiasi starts the
match, you may have the chance
to knock down Dibiasi, whip
Andre into
the ropes, pick up Dibiasi and
throw him into Andre's path,
concluding with giving Andre a
drop kick. At that point, the
computer
opponents are ready to kill
you so exiting the ring is a
good idea. To beat them, I
like to concentrate on Andre.
The sequence is
fairly simple. First, wait
until Andre comes close to you
and tries to slap you down. If
you avoid his attack, you can
immediately
grab him, and whip him into
the ropes (Button B) at which
point you can either give him
a sunset flip or a flying
dropkick. When
he is down, you can pick him
up and repeat as necessary.
Just remember not to grab him
until he tries to swat you. If
he is
sufficiently softened up, you
can pick him up and deliver a
bodyslam. You will also be
able to give him a clothesline
(or in
Randy Savage's case, a flying
clothesline). At that point,
he will try to tag in Ted
Dibiasi. For the Million
Dollar Man, I exit the
ring, using the second
strategy outlined above and
hoping that I can beat him up
sufficiently for either the
count-out or for him
to tag Andre back in. Since
the time runs fairly quickly
in these matches, I go for the
count-out although technically
the
championship does not change
hands on a disqualification.
But then again, it's only a
video game as opposed to
"professional
wrestling" 


When you are playing two
players against the computer,
there are many ways to be
wrestling without having to be
the legal
man in the ring. This is
especially useful if both you
and your partner are low on
health. At the beginning of
any match which
your partner starts (this
alternates every match), he
just has to kick you once
before you reach your corner
and VOILA! instant
double-team action! Of course
your moves are limited to
punches, kicks, body slams and
sunset flips. With another
player who
knows this secret, the game
becomes a laugh riot! You
could theoretically keep both
players in the ring for most
of the match.
Another thing to do is when
your partner and his computer
opponent exit the ring, try to
enter the ring before the
computer
opponent does. His partner
will not come after you, and
if your partner does not come
in, you can throw the computer
guy out
of the ring or lay down an
extra-rich layer of whoopass
on him while your partner
waits. Just remember to keep
moving or you
will automatically go back to
your corner. I remember when I
used to go to the billiards
hall where this game was and I
would
play with this other guy who
was even better than I was. We
would have the strategies down
to a science as we mow down
opponents left and right. He
would kick me to stay in the
ring, then I would grab the
computer opponent and throw
him towards
my partner, who would flip him
out of the ring. I would run
and jump out of the ring,
landing on him and my partner
would do
the same immediately after me.
The computer's partner would
come over and I would rush
back into the ring, waiting
for the
computer. If he came back in,
I would throw him back out and
splash him outside the ring
again. If we were low on
energy
(indicated by the music
change) we would lure the
computer outside and go for
the count-out.


There are some final pointers
in playing WWF Superstars,
such as keeping track of how
much space you have between
your
player and the ropes, lest you
try a suplex too close to the
ropes. That also relates to
moves off the top rope, making
sure your
opponent is not too close to
the ropes or too far away.
Doing a drop kick off the top
turnbuckle makes you face
different
directions depending on which
turnbuckle you launch from.

Tips and Tricks:


Keep firing! At the very
least, keep your finger held
on your fire button and you
will send off a steady stream
of slow
shots, even with no air
attacks present. This is a
useful guide as to whether or
not you can fit between the
tumbling walls,
and if you're concentrating on
bombing, the glassy sound of
you actually hitting an
air-based enemy will alert you
that
another air attack has
arrived.


Watch the edges of your
bomb-sight (the floating
cross-hairs) closely - they
always blink red when you're
over a target.
Two targets located next to
each other can be destroyed
with one shot placed firmly
between them, as can a
grouping of
four ground targets - very
useful for getting rid of
those clumps of shot- spewing
hexes (actually octagons!) in
the later
stages.


There are many hidden rocket
silos, which need to be bombed
in order for the rockets to
show themselves. Once the
rockets appear, they can be
bombed again for extra points.
Although there doesn't appear
to be any reasoning behind
their location, they are
nonetheless always located in
the same place, and your bomb-
sight will always alert you
when
you move over one. To find
them, sweep over seemingly
innocuous areas of green
field, sandy desert and strips
of grey -
your sights should soon pick
them out.


The first one is quite early
on (about 30 seconds into the
game or so), in the right-hand
corner of a field before you
move
over trees and into the first
lot of ground-based targets.
Another can be found just
after a horizontal road that
runs the
whole length of the screen,
dead center in the green
strip. Also check to the right
of the moving target on the
pier after
flying over the ocean for the
first time.


A definite one is after the
first set of tumbling walls,
above and to the left of the
large grey pyramid. 1 can be
found in the
run-up to the first mother
ship - when tackling the
ground targets, look where the
two vertical roads are joined
by a
thinner horizontal strip - one
is hidden in the top-left
crook. Four are located in a
diagonal line before the
second mother
ship, and after you pass over
the bird in the desert the
second time there are 8 in two
long rows of 4!!


There are several "Special"
flags that give you an extra
ship. The Specials are not
detected by your sights - but
if you
imagine them to be submarines
moving at slow speed through
horizontal strips of water,
you're sure to find several.

The first Special is in the
first cross screen river after
three tanks that don't move.
It's usually in the lower part
of the river
on the far left or far right.
Its position moves around so
you need to bomb the whole
river.

During the first set of
tumbling walls, you'll pass
over a half-desert,
half-forest area. Look for a
small lake shaped like a
kidney with a thin stream
running to the right - bomb in
a straight line across the
stream repeatedly (including
into the
lake) and you'll find one
Special. Pick it up for a
bonus ship.

When the gray "walls" start
spinning toward you, wait
until you see the large gray
house in the mid-left part of
the screen.
Immediately fly to the
left-most part of the screen
and wait for your bomb sight
to start blinking, then bomb
away! A tower
will grow from the sand. Bomb
it, and you get a free ship.


Hint on second mothership:
Just before the escort you are
swarmed by ships and 1
anti-aircraft gun, there are 4
missile
silos in a small clearing.
They are laid out in a
diagonal going up from left to
right. If you leave them alone
you will have
an easier time getting to the
second mothership.

Hit the second mothership as
it is coming down!! Don't let
it start moving with you!!


An interesting story by
Dungeon Dave:


One memorable game I played
(on the arcade machine, with
only 3 lives to start with!)
was when I achieved a score of
more than 400,000 - but
although this was a long game,
it was no longer to some
others I had played around the
same
time but with scores in the
200,000 mark. Quite late into
the game, I was faced with
four clumps of 4 shot-spewers
on
either side of the screen, and
after bombing the first clump
with one shot I was rewarded
with the victory tunes of an
extra life. Bombing the clump
on the other side also rang
the same tunes, and the same
thing happened with the other
two clumps - I had suddenly
gained 4 extra lives and my
score had jumped from 150K to
post-400K. To this day, I
still
believe it to be a bug.

I interviewed Ed and asked
him about Xybots:


Xybots was another game that
seemed inspired by computer
games. Any sticky technical
problems designing the "3d"
interface?


Actually there were several
sticky issues. We had no 3D
hardware. We had no bit map
hardware (ala Robotron) either
This game was done on a
hardware that had 8x8 stamps
for the background. The
monsters and shots were done
with motion objects which had
been around since 1977. So the
trick was to build a maze just
using these 8x8 stamps.

(Ed Logg of Atari Games, as 
told to Brian Deuel)

massive bonus points at the

$data
$bio 
Tips and Tricks:


Don't pass if the line of the
pass will take the ball
anywhere near a free-running
defender. 

At the kickoff, you should aim
to get to at least the
opponents' 40 yard line, if
not further. Use your rear
defenders on the
run up the field!

When making a play, look
carefully at the your
opponent's deployment. Are
they all over the right hand
side? Then wait till your
runner is over the left, get
the ball back to the
quarterback and pass straight
to the running back. Then leg
it straight up the left hand
side. When doing this, on
either side, keep as close to
the edge of the pitch as
possible. If you're going to
get tackled, quickly dodge off
the field to end the play.

You can also send the running
back up the field, and run
around with the quarterback
until there's a pass
available. In the arcade, I
used to send the running back
way up the right to the very
top of the screen, and then
run back and left with the
quarterback as quickly as
possible, doing a huge
crossfield throw at the last
second. The opponents would
get sort of "caught in the
scroll" as the ball when
diagonally across and most
times the running back would
be away with no one anywhere
near him.

You can also run the
quarterback straight through
the pack - this is only
sensible when you're at the 5
yard line or so.

Down the ball as soon as you
make 10 yards if you have any
time left. This is because you
can make 10 yards in 15
seconds and get 10 seconds
back for a net loss of 5
seconds. It takes 30 seconds
to make 20 yards and doing it
in 1 play will get a net loss
of 20 seconds (30 - 10), but
doing it in 2 will only lose
10 seconds because you get 2
10 second bonuses
(30 - 10 - 10). Once the clock
runs out in mid-play just go
as far as you can and hope
it's enough to get more time.

Learn the defense formations.
Once you find the correct pass
route for a particular
formation it will work
consistently.

If you see a hard formation
and you are short on time,
your best move may be throwing
an interception and hoping for
an easier formation. This
works best when you have 7 to
10 seconds left and don't
think you can make ten yards
or get downed before time runs
out. Don't try it with less
than 7 seconds though. 6:xx
probably won't be enough time. 

Run to the right during "first
contact" after the kickoff.
There is an extra computer guy
waiting on the left side. The
best way to use the top
blockers is to let the middle
blocker connect, move straight
right until the top right
blocker connects, then head up
again.

You can do a forward pass
after a lateral. This will cut
through a few formations that
are hard passing from the
quarterback position. If you
time it well a diagonal pass
left (right running back to a
left receiver) can miss an
active middle defender.
If you run the ball, use the
receiver to block for you. The
game doesn't have "pass
interference" calls so you
have to be careful not to do
this by accident.

Tips and Tricks:


To kill the robot at the end
of every second level, fly at
2 1/2 units (in other words,
with two blocks of your
altimeter filled in and one at
halfway). Shoot 6 shots at the
robot's missile, and you will
kill it quickly. If you miss,
either dodge the missile, or
keep firing and you can still
blow up the missile. However,
you get less points for
hitting the missile while it's
in the air.


Flying at an altitude of 1 1/2
will allow you to hit ground
targets while making their
shots go harmlessly under you.


Shoot airplanes on the ground:
it will reduce the number you
need to kill in the space
scene. If you shoot all the
airplanes in space you will
get a bonus.


On the levels in outer space,
start up the highest point on
the upper left and start
shooting immediately. You
should be able to hit the
satellite right away. If you
miss, keep moving to the left
and keep firing. This works
for the second satellite also.


This is important in later
levels because it is possible
to run out of fuel in space:
if you hit the satellite, you
will get some back.


There are only two levels that
repeat. The first air fortress
level never gets much harder:
use the same pattern for it.
On the other levels, only the
gaps become narrower.


Always keep firing! This way
you can see if you will make
it through the gaps, and you
can adjust your height as
needed.


The white canopy only
indicates that the enemy plane
is at the highest altitude.
At any altitude, when an enemy
is in your line of fire you
will hear a tone and a white X
appears in front of your
plane. This makes it much
easier to grab the 1,000 point
bonus for destroying 20 enemy
planes, as well as to avoid
their shots.


On later levels you will lose
fuel quickly. Make sure you
hit as many fuel tanks as
possible. If you run out of
fuel you will lose a ship

An obscure trick: On the

some points. Jump off the
ledge then onto it again:
you'll get twice as many
points. And again, for four
times as many. The bonus keeps
doubling until 300K per land.
The best level to try this on

so few coconuts are thrown
