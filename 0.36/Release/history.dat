Get pumped up to compete in the following events :

* 100m Dash : Race against the other athletes as well as the clock. This is just a warm-up compared to the events to come.

* Long Jump : Player dashes to the line, leaps, and propels his body as far as he is able. The player controls the speed and angle of the jump.

* 400m Relay (Qualifying Heat) : Speed and timing are crucial in this event. Player must coordinate the baton hand-off perfectly for the best qualifying time.

* Skeet Shooting : Player can aim left and right at the clay pigeons and must prove that he is a sure shot. A chance for bonus points is given for excellent marksmanship.

* 110m Hurdles : Player sprints down the track, timing his jumps perfectly to clear all of the hurdles and reach the finish line in time.

* Archery : This is a trial of the player's proficiency in using a bow and arrow. The player can decide the direction and force of the wind, which will help in demonstrating his skill as a sharpshooter.

* Javelin Throw : The player darts to the line and throws the javelin with all his might. The player controls the height of the javelin.

* High Jump : Another test of speed and strength as the player runs to the line and hurls his body over the bar. The player can control his angle above the bar.

* 400m Relay - The Final Race : The final test of physical training as the player faces the challenging relay again.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Power-up : after the middle of each stage there´s a helicopter (a plane on 1st stage) that drops a power-up item. So, don´t destroy it till it releases the power-up. Be careful with the helicopter scrap after destroying it, it can kill you.


* 1up player : at the 2nd and 4th stage there is a chance to pick up a 1up item : a group of blocks appears floating on the upper part of the screen, you have to shoot the blue one. You have to hit it with one shot, if you don´t the blue block will turn to red.


* Moai statues : be careful with the Moai Statues at the 6th stage (last stage). Always check if its eyes turn red, if it starts blinking it will shoot.

005 (c) 1981 Sega.


You play secret agent 005, your mission is to take a briefcase filled with secret documents to a waiting helicopter. But, enemy agents are everywhere, trying to thwart your every move, luckily you are armed with cannisters of gas.


- TECHNICAL -


This game came in a generic Sega wood grain panel cabinet (sticker sideart was optional). These were technically all dedicated cabinets, although the lack of any painted art makes the machines easy to switch and still retain originality (a lot of early Sega titles came in this same cabinet). The game boards themselves were Sega G80 System compatible (as were several other Sega titles before "Zaxxon"), and will work in any G80 cabinet. The monitor is mounted vertically, as were most early Sega titles. The monitor bezel sported the standard game instructions and the marquee showed a '005' logo and a shining flashlight (the logo is in a font that reminds me of high school football numbers).


Cabinet dimensions :

Upright : 71,25in. high x 26in. deep x 25in. wide. Weight : 330 lb

- TRIVIA -


Released during December 1981.


005 (pronounced 'double O five'), is based around a pseudo 'James Bond' theme. Instead of secret 'agent 007' you get to play secret 'agent 005' (which allowed Sega to save money by not licensing the 'James Bond' character for this game).


005 is very rare today, as most of them were converted to "Monster Bash" when it came out.

10-Yard Fight (c) 1983 Irem.


An American football game. Each level starts on the kick-off with the player carrying the ball as far up the field as possible before being tackled. Then, as the quarterback, you can either run or pass the ball to a receiver. An intercepted pass earns a penalty of 20 yards. Running out of bounds stops the clock. Extra points after touchdowns can either be kicked or run into the end zone.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Don't pass if the line of the pass will take the ball anywhere near a free-running defender.


* At the kickoff, you should aim to get to at least the opponents' 40 yard line, if not further. Use your rear defenders on the run up the field!


* When making a play, look carefully at the your opponent's deployment. Are they all over the right hand side? Then wait till your runner is over the left, get the ball back to the quarterback and pass straight to the running back. Then leg it straight up the left hand side. When doing this, on either side, keep as close to the edge of the pitch as possible. If you're going to get tackled, quickly dodge off the field to end the play.


* You can also send the running back up the field, and run around with the quarterback until there's a pass available. In the arcade, I used to send the running back way up the right to the very top of the screen, and then run back and left with the quarterback as quickly as possible, doing a huge cross-field throw at the last second. The opponents would get sort of 'caught in the scroll' as the ball went diagonally across and most times the running back would be away with no one anywhere near him.


* You can also run the quarterback straight through the pack - this is only sensible when you're at the 5 yard line or so.


* Down the ball as soon as you make 10 yards if you have any time left. This is because you can make 10 yards in 15 seconds and get 10 seconds back for a net loss of 5 seconds. It takes 30 seconds to make 20 yards and doing it in 1 play will get a net loss of 20 seconds (30 - 10), but doing it in 2 will only lose 10 seconds because you get 2 10 second bonuses (30 - 10 - 10). Once the clock runs out in mid-play just go as far as you can and hope it's enough to get more time.


* Learn the defense formations. Once you find the correct pass route for a particular formation it will work consistently.


* If you see a hard formation and you are short on time, your best move may be throwing an interception and hoping for an easier formation. This works best when you have 7 to 10 seconds left and don't think you can make ten yards or get downed before time runs out. Don't try it with less than 7 seconds though. 6 :xx probably won't be enough time.


* Run to the right during 'first contact' after the kickoff. There is an extra computer guy waiting on the left side. The best way to use the top blockers is to let the middle blocker connect, move straight right until the top right blocker connects, then head up again.


* You can do a forward pass after a lateral. This will cut through a few formations that are hard passing from the quarterback position. If you time it well a diagonal pass left (right running back to a left receiver) can miss an active middle defender.


* If you run the ball, use the receiver to block for you. The game doesn't have 'pass interference' calls so you have to be careful not to do this by accident.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint : Your airplane doesn't lose energy when it collides with cliff-walls, buildings etc. Instead it will rotate a bit after such collisions. That means you can tumble up and down these obstacles (keep on colliding), and if you keep shooting, your shots will go in all directions. This way you can clear up a lot of enemies when you are under pressure (while rolling you are invincible).

- SCORING -


Small planes are 30, 50, 70, 100, 150, or 200 points each.


The small red planes that fly formations of 5 or 10 are 100 points each.  Shooting all the planes in the 5 plane formation awards 500 bonus points.   Shooting all the planes in the 10 plane formation awards 1,000 bonus points. In both cases, when the last plane of a formation is destroyed, a powerup marker appears and is worth 1,000 points when picked up.


Occasionally a small airplane comes slowly out of the lower left or lower right hand side of the screen and flies towards the top. When hit, it turns into a special figure which awards 5,000 points when picked up.


Medium size planes are 1,000 or 1,500 points each.


Large bomber planes start at 2,000 points each. The score for each consecutive bomber destroyed without the player dying is 500 points more than the previous one, up to a maximum of 9,000 points. When the player-s ship is destroyed, the score for the bombers is reset back to 2,000 points.


There are four boss planes. They appear at the end of stages 26, 18, 10, and 02 :  

The stage 26 boss plane is worth 20,000 points.

The stage 18 boss plane is worth 30,000 points.

The stage 10 boss plane is worth 40,000 points.

The stage 02 boss plane is worth 50,000 points.


For all enemy planes that require more than one hit to kill, each hit on them gives 100 points.


At the end of each stage a bonus is awarded for shooting down percentage and for unused loops :

100% = Special bonus 50,000 points (the game displays 10,000 points bonus but 50,000 points are actually awarded)

95-99% = 20,000 points

90-94% = 10,000 points

85-89% = 5,000 points

80-84% = 4,000 points

70-79% = 3,000 points

60-69% = 2,000 points

50-59% = 1,000 points

Under 50% = 0 points

Unused loops are 1,000 points each.


Finishing the final stage awards 10,000,000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* On stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04, a V-formation of red planes will come straight down from the top. If all 5 of the planes are destroyed, a Black/Red POW appears, giving the player an extra airplane when picked up.


* On stages with the wingmang powerups, use them to kill off the large bombers easily by crashing a wingman into them. You will get a second chance to get them back later on.


* On the stages with the boss planes, save all your loops; shoot at it quickly, loop down to avoid the shots, shoot at it again and THEN loop. You should be able to kill it this way.


* Most of the time it is easier to keep only one wingman rather than both; that way it's easier to maneuver around enemies. If you miss the red airplanes that give you the wingman powerup, kill off your plane (assuming you have some remaining) and the game will place you back before them.


* An interesting bug : If you win an extra plane from points when killing a boss plane, no extra planes will be awarded on the basis of points. Extra planes can still be obtained by getting the Black/Red POW, but no point-based bonuses will be awarded for the rest of the game.


* The end of stage bonus for 100% shooting down is actually 50,000 points, even though the game displays a 'special' bonus of only 10,000 points.


When the player loses all of his ships, the game offers to continue for another credit. If this option is chosen, the game continues where it left off but the score is reset to zero.


* There are 6 kinds of powerups : Quad fire, destroy all enemies on screen, 2 wingmen, make enemies stop shooting temporarily, extra loop, and extra life. Note that the destroy all enemies powerup does not destroy the small slow plane that has the 5,000 bonus item pickup.


Quad fire powerups are found on stages 32, 28, 24, 20, 16, 12, 08, and 04.

Destroy all enemies powerups are found on stages 31, 21, 19, 18, 11, 07, 03, and 01.

Wingman powerups are found on stages 30, 26, 22, 18, 14, 10, 06, and 02.

Extra life powerups are found on stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04.

Stop shooting powerups are found on stages 27 and 15. 

Extra loop powerups are found on stages 23, 18, 17, 13, 09, and 05.


* % and point up stages are 29, 25, 21, 17, 13, 09, 05, 01. During these stages none of the enemies fire on the player except the large bomber planes.


* If the player earns enough bonus planes so that 10 ships or more are in the reserve, the 10 remaining ships indicators are replaced by the Greek letter sigma (&#931;).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Choose Your Weapon : Hold these buttons at the beginning of each stage to activate the weapon... 

Stage 1 for a Small Shot Gun, press 1P side Down and 2P side A. 

Stage 2 for a Big Shot Gun, press 1P side A and 2P side B. 

Stage 3 for a Laser, press 1P side Upright+A+B and 2P side Down+B. 

Stage 4 for a Big Shot Gun, press 1P side Downleft+B and 2P side Leftup. 

Stage 5 for a 3-way, press 1P side A and 2P side Up. 

Stage 6 for an Auto, press 1P side Left and 2P side Right+B. 

Stage 7 for a Shell, press 1P side Upleft and 2P side Down. 

Stage 8 for a 3-way, press 1P side Left+A+B and 2P side A+B.

Stage 12 for a 3-way, press 1P side Right+A+B and 2P side Upright+A+B. 

Stage 13 for a Auto, press 1P side Up and 2P side Down. 

Stage 14 for a Laser, press 1P side Upleft+A+B and 2P side Right+A+B. 

Stage 15 for a Shell, press 1P side Downright+A and 2P side Downleft+A. 

Stage 16 for an Auto, press 1P side Right+A and 2P side Upright+A. 


* Full Ammunition Load : A little known trick in the game is to hold down the fire button at the very end of a board immediately after beating the boss. By holding down the button until the plane takes off in the subsequent board, the game gives you a full ammunition load (65 Seconds)! This trick only works every third board or so and it may even change your selected weapon. 


* The ''100% accuracy'' bonus refers NOT to how many planes you down during the round, but rather how many of the guns on the enemy aircraft carriers you get. For this reason, it's best to ignore the planes and concentrate on the ships - that's where the big points are. 


* It's possible to shoot one of the ships just before your plane dives in to battle the fleet, and that you can capture the flames that erupt from it. This gives a 10,000 point bonus. 


* At some points in the background there are ''shootable'' patches which will yield a bonus when shot enough. They can be recognized by the sparks which will occur when your bullets hit them. One such bonus is on level one : it is on the lowest part of the second cloud bank to the left after the last large plane of the level appears. It appears as a cow. There is also another shootable area which appears after the first ship in the first level, in the water above it. 

1) The cow bonus is worth 20,000 points, and on the first level, it's followed by a strange object that looks like a dragonfly moving right to left across the screen. Shooting the dragonfly yields an additional 10,000 point bonus. 

2) The cow and dragonfly bonuses also appear on other rounds; the cow can sometimes be seen on the deck of a carrier! 

3) There's a bonus shaped like a spinning cat (!). When collected, it upgrades your weapon to a laser. 


* The 'star' bonus gives you 5,000 points when caught. It may also increase the capacity of your fuel gauge by eight units (mine went from 64 to 72 units). The white star also gives you the max seconds of weapon (if you get it with no weapon, the next time you get one you'll get 64 seconds instead of 20). 


* (This has been reported on level 2, but may exist on other levels as well) : Sometimes an astronaut will emerge from the side of the final (boss) ship and walk off the screen. Shoot it for 100,000 points! This happens most often when the command tower is shot repeatedly before the ship is destroyed. 


* If you get the ''propeller'' power-up (it looks like a propeller over a circle), your energy level will be fully replenished. 


* Still another bonus is shaped like an pine cone or acorn. When you fly over a certain spot, the pine cone shows up and is worth 2,000 points. 


* When the boss ship explodes, the control center breaks into 4 pieces. The pieces are worth 10,000 points each if shot. 


* If you shoot a POW enough to cycle it through about 4 or 5 times, it will turn into a fueltank :) that helps a GREAT deal on the last few stages, especially a stage or 2 where they DON'T give you a full tank at the end of the cloud stage before you go to the water!

Released in November 1995.


This game is an official licensed product of the NHLPA (National Hockey League Players Association). It features the voice of the legendary NHL announcer Pat Foley. Over 100 real players, each player's skill level reflects his real NHL ability. This is the only NHL game that has had the rights to have both of hockey's greatest, Wayne Gretzky & Gordie Howe (hidden player) in the same game.


During the match, you can see in the background an advert for Kellogg's Corn Pops.


The flyer of this game has a photograph of the Chicago Blackhawks goaltender Eddie 'The Eagle' Belfour on it. The text refers to a '140mph' slapshot -- The individual who wrote this seems to have forgotten to do the metric conversion from kilometers per hour. He/she should have written 140 km/h (or 90 mph) as that's more realistic.

- TRIVIA -


Developed by Pallas.


Released in September 1991.


Notable downfalls :

* There is no infield fly rule in this game, which can be used to the advantage of a defender if there are base runners. Double plays and even triple plays are common because of this.

* A base runner cannot begin to steal bases until the pitcher has released the ball. In most baseball video games and in real life, a runner can begin to steal the next base at any time. However, stealing a base beforehand can only be done if you continuously press the steal button right after the screen cuts-back after the batter hit a foul ball, and the pitcher will not even notice you running.

* The 3rd baseman, 2nd baseman, and 1st baseman will not leave the base to retrieve a ball. They will instead stand on the base and wait for another fielder to get the ball, which can sometimes mean they will stand there while the ball rolls inches away from them. The only exception would be if the shortstop covers third or second base for the fielder; then they remain in the stationary position.

* Since the game has semi-automatic fielding, you cannot change which defensive player you want to run after the ball, which means sometimes the pitcher will end up chasing a ball well into the outfield.

* If a ball is hit far enough into the stands, it can sometimes become stuck, allowing the batter to garnish an in the park home run. Because of the reduced home run zone, faster players can often round the bases by hitting the ball up into the fair-zone stands.

* The computer players will always attempt to hit the ball straight, as if trying to hit a home run, no matter what the strength of the batter. This can sometimes give an unfair advantage to you, since they do not try to pull the ball just barely fair in order to get a hit. This has its downfall, in that some powerful players will hit home runs easily.

* You cannot play against a team from the other league.

* If you manage to score more than 100 runs, your score will turn back to zero, as there are only two spaces for your runs. Consequently, if you score 101 runs, and your opponent scores two runs, you will lose the game 01-02.

* You cannot change players positions in the field or line up without replacing them.

* If another player is in your line of path to throw the ball, they will catch the ball after you throw it. This means that if the shortstop retrieves a ground ball just behind 3rd base, then the throw will get cut-off by the 3rd baseman and then the pitcher before the ball gets to 1st base. The pitcher will almost always get in the way, and this can present a problem when trying to pull a double play between third and first or second and home.

Released in March 1993. 3 Count Bout was developed by UPL for SNK and this is the last game made by this manufacturer.


This game is known in Japan as "Fire Suplex".


3 Count Bout is the only 'true' wrestling game for the SNK MVS Neo-Geo hardware but not the first. This honor goes to "King of The Monsters" (with giant monsters anyway!) :)


Blues Hablam and Blubber Man are actually the same guy with the same ring attire, only Hablam sports a mask. The same occurs for Gochack Bigbomb and Big Bomberdir with Bigbomb wearing the mask.


The character Master Barnes enters the ring wearing Shoulder Spikes similar to the ones worn by legendary wrestling tag-team The Road Warriors.

600 (c) 1981 Konami.


600 is your standard maze game (one of dozens released in the wake of "Pac-Man", with a few twists. The game begins by showing your turtle entering a building (a very early 'cut scene'), you are then presented with the first maze. Each maze has several boxes (with question marks on them), scattered around. You must open these boxes one at a time by walking on to them. Each box contains either an enemy race car (who will pursue you), or a 'KidTurtle'. The 'KidTurtles' are what you are looking for here. When you find one it will climb onto your back, and you have to take it back to the turtle house which will be located in one of the corners. After you rescue a few turtles the game becomes more difficult because of the amount of baddies that you will have released. However, you have some energy you can use to lay land mines. You can drop these in the path of a baddie, and cause him to freeze temporarily (you can safely walk over frozen baddies). A new game screen starts after you rescue all the 'KidTurtles'. After 8 levels you get to watch a small ending sequence, and then the game starts over with increased difficulty.

- TRIVIA -


This title is similar in concept to "Frogger", but closely resembles the much later "Super Pac-Man" in gameplay. Konami originally wrote this game (which they mysteriously titled "600"), but it was licensed to Stern for US and European distribution (released in 12/1981 as "Turtles"), and only a limited number of games were made bearing the "600" name. Konami also licensed this title to Sega as well, which they released under the name "Turpin".


- UPDATES -


Differences between "Turtles" and "600" :

1) In Turtles you're playing against other bugs/turtles. In 600 you're up against race cars.

2) In Turtles you grab each KidTurtle and bring him home. In 600 you must grab up all KidTurtles before the exit appears.

3) Whereas in Turtles you must grab up bombs from the center when they appear, in 600 you're given a certain amount of energy, which each bomb uses.

4) The wall graphics are a bit more blocky in "600" Also, the cut scenes in between racks in '600' only show one ladder, with the turtle climbing alone.


- SCORING -


Race Car runs into mine : 50 points.

Uncover a Race Car : 80 points.

Uncover a KidTurtle : 100 points.

Bring KidTurtles Home : 150 points.

720° (c) 1986 Atari Games.


720° is a 1- or 2-player (alternating) skateboard themed game with both competitive and street-style skating action. The player portrays the skater who performs skate maneuvers for points and competes in skate parks for medals. The action takes place in a Skate City where all surfaces are skateable. Players can choose where they want to skate in the city, and which skate parks they want to enter, making each new game a different experience.


At the start of each game, players can select one of two play modes. A training game is available for beginning players. In this game, there are numerous playing hints and messages, and the add-a-coin feature is disabled. Experienced players can start off by skating to a higher platform. Fewer game hints are given in this mode, and the add-a-coin feature is offered.


Game play starts with the player in the middle of Skate City. Using a new rotary control and a jump and a Kick button, players maneuver around the city trying to score points by performing skillful skate moves. At various score thresholds, skate park tickets are rewarded. These tickets allow entry into one of the skate parks, where players compete against the clock for gold, silver or bronze medals.


The player's main objective is to compete in as many skate parks as possible. In the city streets, players have a limited amount of time to win entry tickets and make their way to a skate park. In addition, there are numerous city hazards which must be avoided such as BMX riders, cars, Frisbee throwers, and other gangs. To guide the player in the city, players find map areas in streets which momentarily display the layout of the city and the location of the skate parks.


In 720° there are ten class levels which determine the degree of difficulty in the skate parks and the timer in the streets. Players select the class level in which they want to compete. For instance, at the start of each game, there are four unique skate parks which are located in the outskirts of the city. Each park is a different class ranging from class 1 difficulty, which is the easiest, to class 4 difficulty, the hardest.


In 720° players can compete in over 20 different skate parks. Each one requires unique skill moves to qualify for a medal. There are variations of a half-pipe ramp, a downhill; a slalom and a jump park. Each skate park has a distinct music score of its own, creating a different mood for players.


In the skate parks, cash prizes arc awarded to players that qualify for a medal. After each skate park competition, the game continues back in the city for more street-style skating. Players can use their cash winnings to buy equipment from various skate shops which are located throughout the city. Skating equipment helps players perform better moves. Boards give faster speed. Helmets allow more risk-taking for successful maneuvers. Pads give faster recovery from falls. Shoes provide more height on jumps and quicker starts. As a reference for locating skate shops and park entrances, players find map areas throughout the city by skating over a map. A layout of the city is momentarily displayed when players skate over a map.


In 720° a game ends only when players run out of time in the city. When the timer is running low, a SKATE OR DIE message appears along with a warning in speech. When the timer runs out, killer-bees appear as a final warning. If the player is killed by the bees before entering a skate park, the game is over. Using the add-a-coin feature, players can continue where they left off. 720° has an operator option to select maximum number of add-a-coins allowed. By using the add-a-coin, players can keep any special skate equipment they have acquired in the previous game, as well as all accumulated cash, tickets, points, and medals.

The cabinet for this game was unique at this time. The speakers for the game are mounted atop the cabinet in a structure resembling a boom box, in line with the game's skate-kid theme. The display is larger than that for a typical arcade game and of a very high resolution (similar to that used for "Paperboy"). The main control is also unique. This joystick moves in a circular fashion, instead of in compass directions like standard joysticks.

720° is notable in that it is one of the first extreme sports video games. The game's name comes from the 'ultimate' skateboarding trick; turning a full 720° (2 complete circles) in the air after jumping off a ramp.


Ron Perelman holds the record for this game with 527,100 points on June 17, 1987.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Develop skill in using the rotary control in conjunction with the Jump button to do aerial moves, because they are worth more points. Press the Jump button after gaining speed, and then rotate the control in a 360-degree motion. In this game, it is possible to do much more than just a 360-degree turn!


* When attempting certain aerial or rotational moves, it is important to be properly aligned on landing, otherwise the skater bails, or falls down.


* To qualify for medals in the higher classes of skate parks, it is best to try to buy some skate equipment first to allow players to perform harder moves.


* Daring players should try to wait out the timer in the streets, performing skate moves and acquiring points until the timer is about to expire.


* In the ramp park, a good trick is to constantly push the kick button and do skid-outs at the top of each side of the half-pipe. To do this, get to the lip of the ramp, hold the stick parallel with the lip, and stop pressing kick. This will cause you to grind and skid down the ramp. You will be awarded big points at the lip and at the base of the ramp. This procedure may be repeated over and over for some incredible (effortless) high scores.


* Don't forget to visit the skate shops. Do not underestimate what a new board and shoes do for you. Buying new equipment allows you to move faster, jump farther, recover faster, and pull off more tricks.


* In the ramp section, levels 8, 9, and 10 : holding down the kick and jump buttons simultaneously on the lip of the ramp will boost your air. This trick only works when you're going the correct speed (usually your third or fourth jump), and only once (as far as I can tell) per ramp session per level.


* The entire game should focus around the Sessions skate park (the blue park in the right quadrant of the play-field). Making multiple passes through this park will greatly increase your scores. Remember to keep jumping and spinning. A good game should leave you feeling completely exhausted!

APB - All Points Bulletin (c) 1987 Atari Games.


Players take on the role of policeman 'Officer Bob' as he takes to his patrol car and drives the streets in pursuit of lawbreakers. The object of the game is to meet (or preferably exceed) the daily quota of 'busts', as he tries to catch a variety of law-breakers.


Along the way, players must refuel their patrol car (by driving through filling stations) as well as meeting targets within a set time limit. Any accidental collisions or running over of pedestrians will result in the player earning 'de-merits', while a 'perfect day' will earn bonuses, with further bonuses awarded for each arrest made that exceeds the daily quota. Picking up donuts extends the time limit for a day.

APB was Dave Theurer's last game at Atari Games. He went on to work on the 'DeBabelizer' for Macromedia with other Atari alumni. Other games by Dave include "Missile Command", "Tempest" and "I, Robot".


The game enjoyed moderate success in the marketplace, as most Atari games did. It's high-resolution graphics and novel cabinet design, with the flashing lights atop, added to it's initial appeal.

Aero Fighters 3 (c) 1995 Video System.


The 3rd game in this excellent series adheres to the solid shoot-em-up template set down by its predecessors. The player takes on the role of a Jet Fighter aircraft pilot whose mission is to combat world terrorism. The object of the game is to fly from country to country and destroy all opposition around the world, before flying into outer space to combat the menace responsible for the terrorism. Each pilot has his own storyline that ties in with the game.


One enemy shot destroys the player's plane and releases a special power-up that the plane may have been carrying. If the player's final ship is destroyed, all power-ups and extra bombs are released and can be collected if the player chooses the 'continue' option, or if a second player is still active. However, on the final mission in Outer Space, the player is forced to start again at the beginning of the space mission, unless 2 players are active.


Aero Fighters now features an array of 10 selectable pilots :

* American Vought F4U Corsair piloted by Robo-Keaton. 

* American Northrop P-61 Black Widow piloted by the Blazers. 

* Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero-Sen piloted by Hien. 

* Japanese Aichi M6A1 Seiran piloted by Mao Mao. 

* Soviet Il-2 Stormovik piloted by Chaika and Pooshka. 

* Soviet Polikarpov I-16 piloted by Spanky. 

* German Dornier Do-335 Pfeil piloted by Malcolm ('Pfeil' is german for 'Arrow') 

* German Junkers Ju-87 Stuka piloted by Kowful and River. 

* British Westland Whirlwind piloted by Alex and Pictus. 

* British Fairy Swordfish piloted by Cindy and Ellen. 


There are also 2 secret planes (see the TIPS AND TRICKS section for details) :

* The Aka Usagi (Red Rabbit) piloted by Kotomi. 

* The Diabloon piloted by The Man.

Aggressors of Dark Kombat (c) 1994 SNK.


1-on-1 fighter featuring 8 selectable characters.


The game's major innovation is the ability to walk into the background, in a similar manner to side-scrolling beat 'em ups such as "Streets of Rage" or "Final Fight" because of this, unlike many other 2-D fighting games, the game uses one action button to jump, it also does not use the 'D' button, (Which many of SNK's other fighters did), only 2 action buttons are used for attacking (punch and kick), instead grappling and grabbing opponents (Pressing the A & B buttons simultaneously) is the focus of the gameplay, opponents can counter being grabbed, as well as break free. Also featured is weapon play, again similar to beat 'em ups, weapons can be picked up and thrown, or used in special & standard attacks. Weapons are thrown in by background crowd members who will step forward to toss them into the ring. Another (strange) innovation of the game is that characters start to sweat -graphicly- after a while.


Characters have unusually high health for the genre, with multiple, different coloured, health bars in one bar similar to a method of health bars used for boss characters in games of the time, in addition to this, each character has a 'Crazy Meter' at the bottom of the screen, which is built up as characters attack, this gives the character a special, often very bizarre, attack that will kill the opponent outright, known as the Gan Gan Attack in Japan, and the Crazy Attack in the US.


Battles are joined by irreverent, sometimes humorous pre-fight banter from characters, the dialog differs depending on whom each opponent is, and a clashing of 2 small images of the characters eyes, which clash in the center of the screen.

- TRIVIA -


Developed by ADK.


(A)ggressors of (D)ark (K)ombat = ADK. The title is also a kind of pun on "Mortal Kombat".


Released in July 1994.


This game is known in Japan as "Tsuukai GANGAN Koushinkyoku" (translates from Japanese as 'Thrilling Intense March'). 'GANGAN' is also Japanese onomatopoiea for the sound of a large bell or a scolding voice.


Criticism : Aggressors of Dark Kombat is a somewhat unknown title compared to SNK's other fighting franchises such as "Fatal Fury", "Art of Fighting" and their signature fighting title "The King of Fighters" and was not found in great numbers in arcades, nor did it's home console version sell well, and it is generally considered by reviewers and fans of the genre of the time, to be a mediocre title. Now, Aggressors of Dark Kombat is considered a cult game, recommended for all those gamers who wants a different game of those mentioned before.


The game features 8 selectable characters, these characters are not named anywhere in-game, unusual for the genre, which usually gives the character's name in the menu, and almost always places it at some point around the character's health bar. 7 of the characters are new and also appears Kotaro Fuuma from "World Heroes".

* Joe Kusanagi - His nickname is 'Red Panther of Honmoku' and is the protagonist of this story. Joe is the most powerful and famous brawler of the Eastern zone of Japan (know as Kanto). Bored of doesn't find good opponents in his zone, he heard rumors about strong guys in the Western zone, so he travels there to confirm the rumor. Joe is the balanced character in the game, with many combo moves and various techniques. Apart of this game, he appears as a cameo in one of Kisarah's attacks in Neo Geo Battle Coliseum.

* Kisarah Westfield - Her nickname is 'Naive Tomboy'. An English school girl who is known as a femme fatale in Japanese schools. But Kisarah falls in love with Joe Kusanagi and now chases him to obligate Joe to be her boyfriend. She is the only female in this game, the most famous character, and one of the most versatile characters from this game. Kisarah appears as a selectable character in "Neo Geo Battle Coliseum" and as a SNK character card in "SNK vs. Capcom - Card Fighters DS".

* Goh Kidokoro - His nickname is 'Strong Spirit from Naniwa'. Goh is the most famous brawler in Western zone of Japan (known as Kansai) and he has his own gang. Goh got the news about the arrival of 'Red Panther from Honmoku' and now is waiting to fight against this new menace for his goal of nationwide conquest. Goh is the grappler from this game, with many powerful grabs and various powers.

* Kotaro Fuuma - His nickname is 'Angry Hurricane'. His story in the game is simply that he got lost during one of his travels through time and landed in 1994 Japan, where the game takes place, becoming involved in the ensuing fights. Like the rest of characters in AODK, Fuuma doesn't have powers (only his EnRyuuHa signature move from WH series makes the transition with him), but in return, he gains many combo moves and a teleport.

* Leonhalt Domador - His nickname is 'Black Bull'. A German brawler who escapes from his native country as a refugee. He comes to Japan to convert in the most strong fighter of all, no matter what for. Leonhalt is the tallest, slowest and the most powerful fighter from this game. Also he's the rival for Sheen Genus.

* Sheen Genus - His nickname is 'Rising Tiger'. A Canadian amateur wrestler who wants with his group to make his own professional Wrestling Federation, and now is searching strong prople to join to him. Sheen is the wrestler of the game and is the rival of Leonhalt Domador. Recently appears in "SNK vs. Capcom - Card Fighters DS" as an Action card.

* Lee Hae Gwan - His nickname is 'White Fang'. A Chinese martial artist who lives in Japan and works for a school. Now he searches for revenge against the brawler who makes disasters in his school: Leonhalt Domador. Lee is one of the fastest characters in the game, who has a good arsenal of kicks and various martial tricks.

* Bobby Nelson - His nickname is 'Brown Bullet'. An African-American boy who is a basketball player and wanted to be known and famous. To achieve his objetive, Bobby is travelling for the world, waiting to be discovered. Bobby is the fastest and smallest character in this game, and the only one who always have a weapon within (in this case, his basket ball). Recently appears in "SNK vs. Capcom - Card Fighters DS" as an Action card, along with Sean Matsuda from "Street Fighter III".


The game features written lyrics at the credits roll for each character, either it was not feasible to get vocal works for these songs, or it could be an attempt to invite gamers to have fun with these by attempting some sort of karaoke. The latter option seems highly probable due to the popularity of karaoke in Japan.


- UPDATES -


There are almost no differences between the Japanese release of this game & the International versions aside from the rather drastic name change, but it is worth taking notice that there is blood to be found when you use a critical hit on an opponent on the Japanese release only.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Some throws that either break bones or hit the opponent's crotch will stun opponents for quite a long time, allowing you to get an easy chance for a big combo.


* Beat the game 2 times in a row to see all the characters in a super deformed style at the end of the credits.


* Beat the game a second time to get a longer version of the karaoke song in the ending.

This game is known in US as "Haunted Castle".


Akumajou Dracula IS part of the "CastleVania" games series. However, as many games of this series, it is not part of the main storyline. The main character doesn't have any name, but it is believed to be Simon Belmont of the original "CastleVania".

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Combinding Credits : If you've ever played Akumajou Dracula, then you know that you are only allowed 3 continues throughout the game. And since you only get One Life per credit, it makes for a hard game. But if you have four credits in the game and hit the player one start button four times you will combined all four credits together giving you a huge life bar. Making this game a lot easier to play. Only trouble is, if you die, it will be game over because you will have used up all 3 of your continues making your Life Bar bigger.

Released in November 1986.


Ares no Tsubasa translates from Japanese as 'Wings of Ares'. Ares is the Greek god of war.


This game is known in US as "Legendary Wings".


The main character appears as a striker character (Michelle Heart) in "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes".


- UPDATES -


In "Legendary Wings" (US Set 1), the main characters are men whereas in Ares No Tsubasa they are women.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* On each level, a trio of statues arranged in a triangular pattern will appear about three-quarters of the way through. Bomb them until one of them reveals a passageway (you'll have to bomb them all; it's not the same one every time), and fly into it. You'll now be in a cave, free to fly along and collect treasure chests worth 200 points apiece. When you're in the cave, though, don't shoot - if you fire and hit a treasure chest it's destroyed, and some of the cavern walls release enemies when shot.

- TRIVIA -


Released in March 1990.


This game is based upon the movie of the same name (released in 1986).


An Aliens cabinet is seen in The Simpsons arcade game. However it's revealed that a Xenomorph which scares off a Space Mutant (a recurring movie franchise on the TV show) is reveals itself to be none other than Marge Simpson inside the Alien costume.


- UPDATES -


The US version is slightly different, it has the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.


The Japanese version is very unlike any other version to appear in other countries :

* Most obviously, both APC driving levels have been entirely deleted.

* As such, the subplot of rescuing Newt is gone. Therefore, Newt never appears in Stage 1.

* When you take on the 'Shrinky-Dink Alien Quartet', the first one to fully enlarge hops off-screen, leaving you to only battle the other three.

* Many of the aliens, zombies, and mid-bosses can be killed with fewer shots.

*Two new kinds of minor enemy appear in the game :

a) An adult alien bursts out of the background wall during the vent portion of what we consider Stage 5. It functions much like the Ground-Poppers and is destroyed just as easily, but with new animations and from a different angle. It is the only one of its type in the game.

b) The small form of the Shrinky-Dink Alien, as seen in the form of the second mid-boss in Stage 5, reappears in Stage 7. It stands alone on the catwalks with a ring of orange energy circling it and the catwalk in a kind of 'shield'. A few shots destroy it.

* Titles have been given to each level. They are as follows, transcribed as they appear in the game.

Level 1 - Living Quarters

Level 2 - Factory

Level 3 - Factory2

Level 4 - Queen Alien's DEN

Level 5 - Escape Route

Level 6 - Battle Ship SULACO

* Special weapons and bombs appear much more frequently in the game, dropping from the sky for the players to use at regular intervals.

* It is now possible to attain 1-ups in the game. If a player is still carrying a weapon from the last special weapon power-up, the next one to fall on-screen will contain a 1-up. It comes in the form of a red ribbon with a bow wrapped around the word '1up'.

* In addition to the other enemies in this section, ground-popping aliens now appear earlier, during the nest portion of what we know as Stage 3.

* In addition to the other enemies, flying aliens now appear during the first power loader segment, in Stage 3.

* Flying aliens are much more frequent throughout the outdoor portion of Stage 5 and Stage 7.

* Extra exploding barrels appear throughout the game.

* Numerous aliens have changed color. Adult aliens are now purple instead of maroon, face-huggers are now flesh-toned instead of green, etc.

* Many of the adult aliens in the elevator sequence of Stage 3 have been removed. They have been replaced with flying aliens that do NOT damage the cables. This makes this sequence much easier.

* The beams from the 3-Way gun have changed color from purple to orange.

* During the final battle, the queen does NOT breathe fire/acid at you. Instead, after flashing white, she sends out multiple images of herself as a projectile! These are wider and therefore are easier to be hit by.

* The queen charges at you constantly even if you are in the power loader. This makes the final battle much more difficult.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Here's A Way To Get Ridiculously High Scores In Alpine Ski : Go thru the downhill section with the points flags very slowly and avoid collecting positive points :

1) There's some point in the course (should be easy to find) where there's a negative points flag near trees that can be crashed into. This trick is best done here.

2) Collect negative points to roll your score back under zero. You will be granted massive time on the massive points you have. Unfortunately, time will be taken off at an incredible rate.

3) Run over the negative points flag as necessary to get rid of the points you win just by moving forward and crashing into the nearby trees.

4) Repeat Step 4 until you've run out of time. You now have a completely unbeatable high-score which (if it were 1981) people would beg you to tell them how you did it.

WARNING : ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY DON'T GO BACK ACROSS ZERO OR YOUR GAME WILL END IMMEDIATELY!!!

Altered Beast (c) 1988 Sega.


The goddess Athena has been abducted by the Lord of the Underworld. Her father, the great god Zeus, searched for a brave warrior strong enough to save her. He chose a brave warrior who died with honour & courage on the battlefield. Zeus raised the warrior from the grave and granted him the power to morph into a powerful, holy beast in order to do battle against the unspeakable horrors of the Underworld.


Altered Beast is a 1-player sideways scrolling beat-em-up. The game begins with the player controlling the human form of the resurrected warrior. During the levels the warrior will be attacked by a number of flashing animals. Destroying these creatures will result in an orb being dropped. If the player picks up an orb, he will begin his transformation from human into 'Beast'. Once 3 orbs have been collected, the transformation is complete. In beast form the player's character is much faster and stronger than in the human form, and also has the ability to throw fireballs at the enemy. At the end of each stage, after the boss fight, the player's special powers are taken from him and he once again reverts to human form.


The action in Altered Beast veers from being untypically slow-paced and sedate for a game of this nature, but the game's premise and graphical flair helped to seperate it from other rivals of the genre.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* General strategies level by level...


LEVEL 1 : you start off in a graveyard on this level. You will immediately be assaulted by zombies and headless skeletons. Watch out for the tall, granite blocks since they usually release one of these enemies.


BOSS 1 : a pretty easy boss. It takes about 15 hits to put him down. This boss will throw five to seven heads at your location. The best way to counter this threat is to stay in one place and go into the gaps between the heads. When the heads quit falling, hit the boss a couple of times and repeat the above process.


LEVEL 2 : you will be going through the swamps on this level.

1) A big hazard are the frogs. They will latch onto your characters head and drain their energy. Rapidly move the joystick left and right to shake them off.

2) To kill the snakes, you have to hit either their rattle or head. You will be warned of their location by a rattle either sticking out of the ground or the air above.


BOSS 2 : the boss transforms into a giant plant with eyes. He will launch ten eyes, which will slowly drift toward your character. You must destroy all of these eyes to get to the boss himself. In order to score hits, you must hit the central eye. You have to be quick since this boss will put up another wall of eyes to block your attacks. It takes about 20 hits to eradicate this plant.Just Stay in line with the main eye and keep fireing without moving. If eyes get near you use the kick button to send out a shock wave.


LEVEL 3 : you are now entering the caves. The biggest danger is all the crevices. Make sure you keep to the ledges and avoid falling or getting knocked off of them.

1) The Insect Warriors are pretty easy to take care of, although they can cause considerable problems if you are on a ledge.

2) To defeat the turtles, you must first get them out of their shell.

3) The demons and birds present the greatest hazard since they will knock you off the ledges.

4) A good tactic for all the enemies is to let them follow you. Then jump over a crevice and they will fall in.


BOSS 3 : This Boss is fairly easy with a little practice. Get Close to him and keep shooting your death breath. When the spinning ice and fire come out jump towards the boss right before they hit you. Then continue to fire death breath and repeat.


LEVEL 4 : you have entered what appears to be a city.

1) You have already dealt with most of these enemies. Just use the tactics you used from the first level to take care of them.

2) The flying demons present a moderate threat. They will dive down on your character when you are stopped. The best way to deal with them is to entice them to attack then hit them when they are rising up again.


BOOS 4 : another rough boss battle. This time he takes the form of a blue dragon's head. You must hit this boss from underneath to affect him. He moves in a slow circle so time your jumps accordingly. He spits out a solid stream of fireballs. You can duck under most of them. For the ones you can't, just jump toward the boss. In addition to fireballs, he also launches one or two small red dragons to further harass your character. These can be taken out with normal attacks. After 30 hits, you can send this boss packing.


LEVEL 5 : the final level, you will be located in some ruins. You will encounter some pretty vicious enemies on this level. They each have strengths to their credit.

1) The Goat Warriors are quick. They come in for a quick strike and retreat.

2) The Unicorn Warriors jump around and make difficult targets to get a bead on.

3) The Bull Warriors can level your character in a single blow if you aren't careful.

4) The Spiked Balls will continuously roll into your character until defeated.

All these enemies work in tandem to wear your character down quickly and they tend to appear in mixed groups so you will have to do a lot of hitting and running to survive them.

Note: Make sure you get the first 3 power ups or this will be a very hard level.


BOSS 5 : the final boss and appropriately the toughest boss. The boss appears as a large warrior in the shape of a rhino. He has two attacks : The first one is basically going toe-to-toe with your character and beating the stuffing out of him. The second is a charge. The charge will be proceeded by steam coming out of the rhino's nostrils.

1) You will have to constantly move around to avoid this bosses attacks. You can defuse the charge and send this boss backwards by hitting him as he is charging.

2) The boss starts out as a gray color. He will turn red after about 30 hits. He will then turn purple after another 30 hits. 30 more hits and you have accomplished your goal.

3) When he appears go to the extreme left of the screen. When he charges jump high and bound of his head to the right of him. Then run all the way right and jump angain when he charges bouncing off his head to the left. When you land use the rush attack and run to the left of the screen. If after you use the rush attack he punches you will have time throw 1 or 2 fire balls. This will take some practice but is very effective.


Congratulations, you are now a God.

Amazing Maze (c) 1976 Midway.


Each player (up to 2 people may play at a time, 2-player mode is more fun), controls a little geometric shape. Each player starts at opposite sides of the maze. The object is to get to the point where the other player started, before they get to where you started. You use a joystick to guide your 'character' through the maze. The game is time based, and you score a point for each maze you beat faster than your opponent (or the computer player if you are going solo). The factory setting is for a 90 second game, but this is operator adjustable. The graphics are done in monochrome white on black. With no detail on anything. The maze walls are only a pixel thick, while the characters themselves (simple shapes), are not much bigger. The mazes are not stylized in anyway. They look exactly like the kind of maze you would do with a paper and pen.


- TECHNICAL -


This game was released in an upright dedicated cabinet. The cabinet is white and tan with sideart covering the entire machine. Like many other early titles, there was no marquee at all. The name was merely on the monitor bezel (on the top in this case). The name confusion about this game comes from the fact that the monitor bezel says 'Amazing Maze', while the sideart says 'Maze' and the game itself says 'The Amazing Maze Game' on the title screen. The marquee, or monitor bezel title is generally considered to be the definitive one in the case where a game has conflicting titles like that. The control panel was simple, and featured a joystick for each player. But, player 1 had to use his left hand for the stick (like most games), but player 2 had to use their right hand, due to the control panel layout.


Cabinet dimensions : 26,5inch. (67cm) Wide x 64,5inch. (164cm) High x 24inch. (61cm) Deep.

Cabinet weight : 220 lbs.

- TRIVIA -


Released in October 1976. This is one of the first maze video game ever produced, and far more complex than you may be used to. This is no "Ms. Pac-Man". The mazes in this game are as complex as ones you might find in those little maze books you may have had as a child, none of that multiple path, wishy washy stuff like "Pac-Man" or "Lady Bug". These mazes have only one correct pathway through them.


The maze changes with every point made and never repeats itself. You can play the game for 24 hours or for 24 years and not see the same pattern.

$info=amidar,amidaru,amidars,amidaro,amidarb,
$bio

Amidar (c) 1981 Konami.


An abstract arcade game in which players must 'colour in' all of the rectangles on the screen. Each level has a number of patrolling enemies - or 'Amidars' - that must be avoided. Players are aided in their task with the inclusion of a JUMP button which, when used, causes all the on-screen enemies to jump; allowing the player time to escape from a close situation. There are only 3 'jumps' given per level, however.


On even-numbered levels, the player's character is a gorilla; on odd-numbered levels, it is a paint roller. The Amidar enemies are savages and pigs, respectively.


Filling the 4 corner boxes of the screen gives the player a short time in which to chase the Amidars and score extra points. In between levels, there is a chance to earn 5,000 bonus points. Here, a pig moves across the top of the screen. By pushing the jump button, the pig traces a path across the boxes towards the bottom of the screen. If the savage or pig reaches a bunch of bananas, a bonus is awarded.

A bootleg of this game is known as "Amigo".


Re-released by Konami on the "Scramble" hardware in 1982.

Japanese version : Worse attract mode and does not display the number of jumps left Also higher scoring (20 points per coconut/segment).


The "Scramble" hardware version has different character's names.


- SCORING -


Collecting a coconut or painting a segment : 10 points.

Filling in a box with the paintbrush : the score in the centre of the box - 100 to 700 points.

Killing the Amidars and Tracer after filling in the corner boxes : 100 points, 200 points, 400 points, 800 points, 1,600 points, etc. 3,200 is the maximum on later levels (only in the Japanese version).

Collecting the bonus banana on the interim level : 5,000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* The Tracer always follows the outside edge and is easy to avoid. Try to ensure it is within range when you complete the fourth corner box of the maze, making it easy to kill.


* The Amidars all have a set movement pattern, which is detailed by the 'Amidar movement' on the title screen. They only move in 4 ways :

a) up/right,

b) up/left,

c) down/right

d) down/left.

They will follow their current pattern of movement (a, b, c or d) until they reach the edge of the maze when they move round the edge of the last box they contact and continue with their new pattern. e.g. Up/right to the top right of the maze, round the last box and then down/left to the bottom left corner. Mastering their pattern of movement is the key to success!


* If all Amidars are close to the bottom of the screen on the coconuts level, they will take a while to make it to the top. Use this time to clear as much of the top area as you can.


* Remember you have 3 jumps available on each level so make use of them to get yourself out of a tight corner. 2 quick jumps if used in succession will easily give you enough time to get well clear of any danger.

Worm : 200 points.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Ants can be killed by moving directly into them, but watch out for your tongue above when you are in the lower part of the anthill. Ants can only be killed by the tip of your tongue, and if they hit the extended part you lose a life.


* Worms cannot be killed head-on, but cause no damage when they hit your extended tongue. You should move down below a worm or wait for it to pass, and then move in to eat it from behind.


* Spiders can only be killed by eating a Queen Ant. This will destroy all insects on the level, removing any imminent danger. Spiders move across the top tunnel of the screen until they reach the middle, and then walk down your tongue, until they reach the tip which causes you to lose a life.


* Try to save eating the Queen Ants for as long as possible, until absolutely necessary to save you from a life-threatening situation.


* Worms often appear at the same time as ants, and this will make killing them difficult. Also, you have to be careful the ants do not hit the tongue. You must move the the row below them and cut round behind them, as eat them both before the ant makes contact with the extended part of the tongue.

Arabian (c) 1983 Sun Electronics.


You'll have 1001 hours of fun with the ARABIAN upright game! You are the adventurous Arabian prince, and your goal is to rescue the princess from her palace. Use the joystick control and the KICK button to move through perilous passages. Sail the seas, crawl in caves, and fly magic carpets - you'll be challenged by 4 increasingly hard waves of play! Score points on the way for picking up the letters in A-R-A-B-I-A-N, and get a bonus if you pick them up in order!


Arabian is a 'video book' with a happy ending! The attract mode introduces the story, and animated storybook 'pages' let you experience the Arabian Prince's adventures. Use the 8-position joystick to jump, super-jump, walk, crawl, or climb in all directions. Tap either KICK button (are you right- or left-handed?) to kick your enemies out of the way.


The player controls a young Arabian Prince who must rescue his Princess from the castle tower where she is being held prisoner. Evil Genies in brass jugs, swooping Rocs, and purple ghostly creatures called Oscars will try to stop him along the way. The Prince scores points for kicking Oscars or Rocs, picking up lettered jugs, or spelling A-R-A-B-I-A-N. The Prince loses a life when he's hit by a smokeball, falls off a ledge, flying carpet or vine, or gets caught (touched) by a Genie, Oscar, or Roc.


The Prince must successfully complete 4 levels to rescue the Princess (4 levels or 'pages' equals 1 section). Each level is introduced with the turning of a page, which shows a distant view of the upcoming playfield. Each playfield has 7 lettered jugs that must be picked up before the player can advance to the next level, but he must avoid or KICK evil Genies, Oscars, and Rocs that will try to stop him.


Page 1. Page l turns, revealing a ship. The Prince must work his way to the crow's nest at the top of the mast before the vessel reaches the shore. As he climbs up the rigging, Rocs and Oscars dive at him in an attempt to knock him down. The Prince must KICK them out of the way to survive. While contending with these rascals, he must also try to collect all the jugs with letters on them. Beware! The jugs hold devilish Genies which can appear at any time and throw smokeballs at the Prince. Once a Genie has materialized, the Prince's kicking power cannot be used against him and he is unable to collect the jug so he should avoid the Genie. However, the Prince may collect the jug while the Genie is in smoke. When the Arabian has collected all the jugs and reaches the top of the ship, Page 2 introduces the second level of the story.


Page 2. Now the Arabian has arrived on shore. To reach the Princess he must complete a cave maze under the cliff. Low-hanging rocks and climbing vines force him to crawl and climb. The Prince must still dodge Rocs, Oscars, and the Genie's smokeballs. And he must still collect the brass jugs. When he reaches the top of the cave, he must try to collect the letter N jug.


Page 3. Now the Arabian Prince must scale the walls of the castle. As flying carpets whiz by, the Arabian must jump from one to the next, taking care he isn't knocked off his present perch by another carpet flying too closely He can duck to avoid them, but his timing has to be precise or he will take a tumble down to the ground. He must still dodge Rocs, Oscars, and the Genie's smokeballs. The player must beware - sometimes a pair will merge into one super Roc bird or super Oscar!


Page 4. The Prince has at last entered the castle. The Princess beckons him from high in the tower. To reach her, he must ride atop some flying carpets and pull himself up ropes - all the while collecting the brass jugs and kicking meddlesome Rocs and Oscars. When he reaches his loving and grateful Princess, the 2 fly happily into the sunset on a magic carpet.


Once the player has taken the Arabian through a section (all 4 levels), the next section begins. But the action gets faster, the Genies are angrier and fling more smokeballs, and there are more intelligent and challenging Rocs and Oscars. Even the brass jugs are rearranged so that it becomes more difficult for the player to spell A-R-A-B-I-A-N in order.

Killing 2 monsters with one kick : 600 points.

Killing 3 monsters with one kick : 1,600 points.

Killing 4 monsters with one kick : 3,600 points.

Kick Super-Roc or Super-Oscar :  1,000 points.

Kicking a mutant blob : 2,000 points.

Collecting a pot : 500 points.

Spelling ARABIAN : 2,000 points + 2,000 points x section number.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Hints for Game Play :

* The player can still complete a level even if he collects the jugs out of sequence. But if he collects jugs in sequence to spell A-R-A-B-I-A-N, he'll score many more bonus points.

* Kicking a Roc or Oscar into other Rocs or Oscars awards higher points.

* When a Genie begins to appear, the player should move to an area which allows him to avoid the smokeballs the Genie will throw!

* Try to kick off the monsters in pairs for more points. They don't have to be close together : one hitting another knocks the other off screen.

* Don't move through a crawlway when there is a blob regenerating on the other side. You move much slower when crawling, can't kick and chances are you won't make it through in time.

* You can kick monsters slightly above and in front of you if you kick when jumping.

* If you jump onto a ladder you land on it half way up and can then continue climbing, thereby getting you up quicker.

* You can't jump when there are vines above you as you cling to them.

Argus (c) 1986 NMK.


While it borrows heavily from the game which established the vertically scrolling shooter, "Xevious", Argus adds its own unique twists. The player's ship is always presented in the center of the screen, and as the player moves left and right, the ground actually scrolls in the opposite direction. The player can continue scrolling all the way in one direction and end up back where he or she started.


Other new concepts include walls of mazes that float in the air which may be optionally traveled through. Certain ground targets provide power-ups or special weapons, but they must be bombed 3 times in order to earn them. A boss sequence occurs at the end of each stage. The boss has one infrequently exposed weak spot that only takes one bomb to destroy, but the boss will leave after an alloted time if the player does not succeed. There is a landing sequence after the boss fight that must be successfully maneuvered for bonus points. And finally, the ship receives a new weapons at each stage (5 distinct combinations which cycle).


The arcade game features 16 levels, the last four of which repeat indefinitely.

Arkanoid (c) 1986 Taito.


After a sudden alien assault, the Arkanoid spaceship has been destroyed and the only survivor, the small 'Vaus' space vessel, has been mysteriously trapped in another dimension by an unknown enemy. The player is charged with helping the 'Vaus' overcome the security systems, as well as the many enemies that guard them, before finally finding and destroying 'DOH', the alien responsible for the attack.


Arkanoid is an update of the early ball and paddle video games - and specifically of Atari's 1978 classic, "Super Breakout" - in which the player takes control of a paddle at the bottom of the screen and must use it to deflect a ball into rows of bricks at the top of the screen, thus destroying them and, eventually, clearing the screen to progress to the next level. 


As well as impressive and colourful graphics, Arkanoid introduced a number of new elements to the classic bat 'n' ball gameplay. Certain bricks, when destroyed, would release a power-up - in the form of a falling capsule. the player had to catch the capsule to retrieve the power-up. Among the many enhancements the power-ups provided were an increased 'bat' size, multiple balls, 'sticky' ball (which would stick to the bat and could be released when the player chose) and even a laser, which allowed the player to shoot the bricks.

Licensed to Romstar for US distribution (December 1986).


Arkanoid has remained a popular game and is commonly cloned by aspiring game developers in freeware and shareware titles. Many companies have also regularly cloned the game in arcades.


Arkanoid's popularity led to it being featured in "Rainbow Islands - The Story of Bubble Bobble 2", which has a whole level (4 stages in all) dedicated to the game, including DOH as the level boss.


Nick Mollison holds the official record for this game on extremely hard settings with 1,156,930 points on September 7, 2008.

Zack Hample holds the official record for this game on normal settings with 1,658,110 points on March 13, 2000.


2 bootlegs of this game are known as "Block" and "Paddle 2". There is a hack made by Two-Bits score known as "Arkanoid Plus".

Bootlegs version don't use the M68705 @ 500 Khz :-)


The Japanese version supports cocktail mode whereas the others don't.


- SCORING -


Points are scored for destroying bricks and killings aliens.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Pill descriptions :

S - Slow : slows down the energy ball.

L - Laser : enables the vaus to fire laser beams.

C - Catch : catches the energy ball and shoots it when you want it.

B - Break : allow player to move to next playfield.

E - Expand : expands the vaus.

P - Player : gains an additional vaus.

D - Disrupt : splits the energy ball into three particles.


* The power pills are not quite random. There are essentially two types of games. One has lots of light blue multi-ball pills and the pink warp pills - this is a low scoring game. The high scoring game gives you more of the other pills.


* On each level, the ball will not speed up completely until it hits the back wall, so :

1) Try to remove bricks from the bottom up, or punch a hole through thicker areas of bricks rather than go straight through (e.g. take out the left side of level 2 rather than the single block at the right as you will catch far more pills).

2) If you have collected a lot of S pills and the ball has been in play for a bit of time, be prepared for a sudden speedup.


* Also, the D token speeds up the balls and is pretty useless on most levels (the one with the enclosed diamond is the only good example I can think of).


* As only one pill can fall at a time, multiple balls can reduce your potential score quite drastically. Every pill is worth 1000 points. For the first few levels, get every pill you can, but do not use the special powers. You will get a lot of extra ships and should get a gray P or two - thereby starting early with 6 or 7 ships.


* In the final level, where you face DOH himself, you should get 15 hits (1000 points per hit) on DOH/per man until you defeat DOH with the 16th hit on your last man to end the game.

Arm Wrestling (c) 1985 Nintendo.


An arm wrestling game in which the player takes on a number of different, distinctly cartoon-like opponents. The game's graphical styling is very similar to Nintendo's classic "Punch-out" series. Game-play requires that the player initially pushes the joystick to the left, but whenever the computer opponent starts to act, the player must push the joystick to the right to counter-attack, and press the button to increase power. If the counterattack is unsuccessful, moving the joystick back and forth several times will prevent the player from being pinned. The player's opponent must be pinned before the counter reaches one minute, or the match will be lost.

- SCORING -


* 50 points for each second of correctly pushing the joystick left to push your opponent.

* 100/300/400/600/700 points for each object you light up above your opponent's head on a counterattack.

* 50 points for each time you push left after getting a power up and freezing your opponent's action. This may become 100 on higher levels, but it never goes above 1000/2200 depending on the opponent.

* 400 points per second for winning each fight, in increments of 40 points.

* 50000 points for catching the money bag (after fights 2 and 5).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* As soon as the match begins, if your timing is right, pushing 'left' will catch the computer player off guard and score an automatic full 'power', this generally helps you to beat the computer player faster. Be careful not to foul twice, however, or your game is over.

Armor Attack (c) 1980 Cinematronics.


A wireframe, top-down shoot-em-up in which the player controls a small jeep and must destroy the many tanks and helicopters that populate the war-torn cityscape that represents the game's single play area. As with many games of the time ("Space Invaders", "Battlezone", etc.), Armor Attack's graphics were simple monochrome, with a colour overlay added to the cabinet to give the impression of multicolour graphics.


- TECHNICAL -


Armor Attack came in an upright white cabinet, with stick-on sideart featuring a tank scene and a yellow 'Armor Attack' logo. This was the same cabinet used for "Star Castle" and a number of other Cinematronics titles. The top of the cabinet is adorned with a rather plain marquee that has the Armor Attack logo in yellow on a black background; together with a few game instructions. The control panel had a picture of a green and yellow tank, and had the player controls which consisted of 10 pushbuttons, without a joystick to be seen anywhere (the game controls are almost exactly the same as "Asteroids" or "Star Castle", except that your jeep stops moving when the player stops pressing the move button). Most of the graphical time was spent on the monitor bezel and overlay, which showed a single scene of a ruined town.

As mentioned in the 'Description' section, all of the background graphics were created with the addition of a monitor bezel/plastic overlay; with the game itself only generating the jeeps, tanks, helicopters and the shots they fire. Armor Attack was one of two games Skelly created for Cinematronics that required overlay backgrounds, with 'Warrior' being the other. Skelly designed six vector games and programmed five of them during his tenure at Cinematronics.


According to some, the morse code sound effects in the background actually spell out a message : "Don't Register". This was reportedly a form of protest by Skelly against the fact that draft registration had recently been re-instated.


Paul Hall and Derek Davis hold the official record for this game on 'Doubles' settings with 2,257,850 points on April 2, 1982.

Tom Larkin holds the official record for this game on 'Single' settings with 2,009,000 points on September 25, 1982.

- TRIVIA -


Released in September 1992.


This game is known in Japan as "Ryuuko no Ken" (translates from Japanese as 'Dragon and Tiger Fist').


A bootleg of this game is known as "Fit of Fighting".


SNK's second fighting-game franchise. It was the first fighting game by SNK to feature the character designs of former SNK illustrator Shinkiro, who would go on to do the character designs for the later "Fatal Fury" and "The King of Fighters" games.


This is the first fighting game to feature the 'camera zoom' - where the camera zooms in when the fighters are close together and zooms out when the fighters move away from each other. This is also the first fighting game to utilize a 'spirit meter'. Every time a special move is executed the spirit meter is depleted accordingly. The more powerful the special move, the more it depletes. When it's empty special moves can't be done anymore, however, you can recharge the spirit meter by standing still and holding the A or B button leaving you totally defenseless.


The Haou Shokou Ken was referred to as the Haou Ken (or as the game put it, the 'Haow-Ken'). Its similarity to Ryu's (of "Street Fighter" fame) Hadou Ken forced the name change.


The character's fighting stance and their victory pose depends on how beaten up they are.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Play as Todoh, Jack, Lee, King, Micky and John : player 2 must join.


* Play as Mr. Big and Mr. Karate : reach them on 1P Game, then player 2 must join.


* Move Command Delay : its possible to input the commands for any special or super move but it is not necessary to press the corresponding attack button right away, this allows you to delay any move for as long as you want in order to surprise an opponent! This trick also enables you to perform slower versions of some special moves such as projectile attacks. Try it! :)

- TRIVIA -


Released in March 1994.


This game is known in Japan as "Ryuuko no Ken 2".


Geese Howard's guest appearance (see 'Tips And Tricks' section) tries to tie this game's story with the Fatal Fury games. Apparently, this game takes place a few years before the events occurred in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" since Geese looks quite young and uses a very different fighting style (instead of his trademark Aikido which he learned in Japan). Another fact is the special ending when you defeat Geese (you get to see when he gives the order to eliminate Jeff Bogard who happens to be Terry & Andy Bogard's father, before he heads to Japan to learn that country's martial art techniques). This fact also explains why Ryo Sakazaki is so damn powerful in his "Fatal Fury Special" appearance (after all, he was already a powerful & skilled fighter and has had more time than most of the Fatal Fury characters to brush up on his techniques!). Obviously, all these storyline details were ignored in the King of Fighters series for the sake of convenience (All the "Art of Fighting" characters should be way older than the Fatal Fury characters in that game!).


In Temjin's ending, Terry Bogard makes a guest appearance as a little boy!


- UPDATES -


The Japanese version features different voice actors for some characters (John Crawley, Robert Garcia & King).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Adjust the game difficulty setting up to level 8 in order to boost game's overall speed!


It may be downright cheap & silly, but if you successfully manage to throw an opponent and then hit him with a special move as he gets up, you will dizzy your opponent! This can be done over and over again with most characters... :/


Beat opponents with a special move at the end of the decisive round to see a special 'defeat' animation (some auto-combos & special moves that lift the opponent of the ground won't work though).


Defeat all opponents in two rounds only to fight a special battle against Fatal Fury's main villain & owner of Southtown : Geese Howard (Notice that it is possible to use continues & use different characters as long as you defeat your opponents in 'two rounds only'!). :)

Assault (c) 1988 Namco.


Your mission is to reclaim your homeland by destroying the enemy forces that have taken over. You have an Assault tank, the supreme mobile weapon. Your tank has artillery guns and grenades, can perform Rapid Rolls to dodge enemy shots, and uses Power Wheelies to launch grenades.


Your controls are two 4-position joysticks with triggers. These controls make Assault like no other tank game. You have a quick, highly responsive vehicle with fast movement in all directions. To avoid enemy shots, Rapid Roll your tank left or right by moving both joysticks to the same side. To launch grenades, put the tank in the Power Wheelie position by moving both joysticks to the outside, then pressing either trigger. Your grenades are triple the fire power of your tank's standard shots.


Your tank is always in the center of the screen no matter what direction you are going. With Assault's 360-degree scrolling playfield, the world rotates around you as you move. An arrow always points you towards the exit to the next level.


The lift zone gives you an advantage over the invaders and a spectacular view of the playfield. Each lift zone is a five-sided platform on the playfield that flashes red when you can use it. When you drive onto the lift zone, your tank jets straight up to get a bird-s eye view of the surrounding terrain and enemy lines. From this overhead position, you can reconnoiter enemy forces and bomb enemy outposts.


Fight your way through 11 different levels to seek out and destroy the invader's headquarters. To succeed, you must :

* Dodge enemy gunfire with the Rapid Roll maneuver.

* Assault enemy lines with long-range powerful grenades launched from Power Wheelies.

* Destroy all enemy tanks you encounter to prevent rear attacks.

* Bomb enemy outposts and reconnoiter enemy emplacements using the lift zones.

* Protect yourself against enemy artillery using buildings and trees.

* Blow up the large cannons on each level while you avoid enemy attacks.

* Follow the arrow to find the exit to the next level. Before you can exit, you must destroy the large cannons defending the enemy strongholds.


- TECHNICAL -


The Assault dedicated cabinet is a real favorite among arcade game collectors. This is probably due to its unique shape, and non-standard controls. The Assault cabinet was very narrow, the vertical open frame monitor barely fit between the sides of the thing, which were less than 18'' apart. A standard arcade cabinet is about 23'' wide if it is an older style one, or 30'' wide for one of the newer deluxe cabinet styles. So Assault was very narrow, probably the narrowest game ever made. The top half of the cabinet is decorated with sideart that is supposed to resemble the outside of a yellow tank, and these same graphics carry on over the monitor bezel and control panel as well.


Cabinet dimensions : 74,25'' (188,60cm) high x 25,50'' (64,77cm) wide x 34,50'' (87,63cm) deep.

Cabinet weight : 285 lbs (129,28 kg).

Asteroids (c) 1979 Atari.


Yet another legendary, genre defining game - in an era replete with genre defining classics - in which a single player takes control of a ship trapped in the middle of an asteroid field. A number of large, slow-moving asteroids drift randomly around the play area and must be shot by the player. When shot, the asteroids will break into a number of smaller pieces which must also be shot until eventually, all of the asteroids and fragments will be destroyed and the next wave begins.


Asteroids introduced real-world physics to video-games for the first time, with speed and inertia all adding to the player's problems. As well as the inertia of the player's ship - forcing the player to allow for the ship slowing down and speeding up whenever the Thrust button was utilized - shot asteroids would often send fragments flying in seemingly random directions, and at varying and unpredictable speeds.


As well as the ever-present asteroids, alien saucers also make a regular appearance. These move diagonally around the screen firing at the player's ship and must be quickly destroyed.


CAST OF CHARACTERS :

Spaceship - This is you, the player. You can rotate 360 degrees, fire bullets, thrust forward in any direction, and hyperspace to safety if you feel you are in danger.

Large Asteroid - These are the large rocks that fill the screen at the beginning of each stage. Hitting one with a bullet will break it apart in to 2 Medium Asteroids.

Medium Asteroid - Slightly smaller than Large Asteroids, but faster moving. Shooting one of these will result in two Small Asteroids.

Small Asteroid - These are the smallest and fastest rocks on the screen. If a bullet hits one of these, they will vaporize.

Large Saucer - Large flying saucers appear on the screen from time to time, randomly firing shots around the screen. They pose a minor threat.

Small Saucer - The smaller saucers are more deadly than the large variety. They are much more precise with their shots, and are more likely to kill you. Eliminate them quickly or get out of their range.


- TECHNICAL -


The Asteroids cabinet was identical in construction to the "Lunar Lander" cabinet. It was a black upright with side-art that featured a scene of a starship in a blue field of asteroids (with several red explosions thrown in for good measure). The marquee featured almost identical graphics to the side-art (with the addition of the familiar yellow 'Asteroids' logo). The control panel was a busy looking red, white, and blue affair that had no joysticks (only buttons). While the monitor bezel had kind of a nebula scene printed on it (this did not really seem to match the rest of the machine).


2 different sets of coin doors were made on this title, with early cabinets having a unique design that was soon abandoned in favor of the same one that Atari had been using on Lunar Lander. The cocktail version was a little uncommon, it was rather unremarkable in appearance. It seems that Atari put all the effort into the upright, and merely shipped a generic cocktail version as an afterthought.

Released in November 1979.

Licensed to Sega for Japan market.


Originally called 'Cosmos', Asteroids' original design brief was a simple copy of "Space Wars (Cinematronics)"; with asteroids littering the play-field purely for visual effect. 'Cosmos' was also once known as 'Planet Grab', in which the player had to claim a planet by touching it with their spaceship. 'Cosmos' allowed players to blow up the planets and duel with another ship, Space Wars-style. Only in Asteroids, which arrived 2 years later, did Atari engineer, Lyle Rains, introduce the concept of free-floating rocks.


On 17 June 1980, Atari's Asteroids and "Lunar Lander" were the first 2 video games to ever be registered in the Copyright Office.


The first 200 Asteroids machines were actually "Lunar Lander" cabinets; Asteroids was so successful that Atari cut Lunar Lander's production run and released the 200 aforementioned machines, complete with their original Lunar Lander cabinet art.


Asteroids remains Atari's bestselling arcade game of all time, with approximately 56,565 units produced (47,840 upright and 8,725 cocktail) in total.


* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters : working on Asteroids was so intense that Lyle Rains and Ed Logg often dreamt about their work. Lyle Rains : 'In the course of my work I have always found that there are times during the development process when the project gets to me in such a way that I'm eating, drinking, sleeping, and breathing the project. When I close my eyes the images of the screen are there and I dream about them at night. There is something just very intense when you live with a project like that day and night, for months at a time. When we were working on Asteroids, I would play Asteroids for a number of hours in the evening, then I'd go home and I'd close my eyes, and as I was drifting off to sleep I'd see the asteroids floating around the screen.'.


Ed Logg : 'I was shooting the asteroids all night long; I'd just play the game over and over and over in my head, just as if you were playing it in real life. To a certain extent, I play a lot of the games in my mind long before I ever write them because you have to get all the interactions down pat before you can start programming. I know what it's going to look like before I even get there.'.


* Popular from the Start : a good barometer of a game's future success was how popular it was within the labs at Atari. The software developers often had to chase people away from their Prototype machines when they arrived at their desks in the morning or returned from lunch. Lyle Rains : 'The development on the really good games gets bogged down, because people want to play them all the time. I was in the lab quite often playing Asteroids, as were many other people.'.


On the overall popularity of Asteroids, Steve Calfee said : 'A lot of people really liked it. Somehow, there's something about people, they like to clean spaces. With Asteroids it's easy to measure your accomplishment, you're breaking big rocks into little rocks and then the little rocks into nothing. It's sort of a metaphor for life.'.


Rich Adam recalled his own first encounter with Asteroids : 'I'll never forget going into the lab and seeing that game for the first time. It was like an adrenaline rush. I'm out flying this spaceship and it's the miraculous escape. I've got this situation where I've got tons of these boulders flying around the screen, I have almost nowhere to go. I get to blast my way out of it and cheat death one more time; that's a good fantasy, you've got all these things flying around and yet you're able to survive.'.


Howard Delman described what it was like creating the sounds for Asteroids : 'In those days there were no all-purpose sound chips like we have now, so I had to create a hardware circuit for each sound. I would string together electrical circuits that would produce an output wave-form that corresponded to the wave-form of the sound. When put through an amplifier and a loud-speaker, it would sound like whatever I was trying to create. The boom-boom-boom background sound was sort of meant to be like a heartbeat, and the idea was that as the game progressed, the sound speeded up, and the player's heart would speed up, too. You know, stress!'.


* The Great 25-Cent Escape : On the intensity of playing Asteroids, Ed Rotberg recalled : 'Asteroids was just so intense in the fact that you had a concept of all around fantasy. You had to keep your eyes constantly in motion around the screen because the danger could be coming from any direction, at anytime, and it was always so imminent. In Asteroids it was just you out there, trying to survive. It's an incredibly intense game. The tuning in terms of how fast the spaceship turns and how fast the bullets move and how far they go and how fast the asteroids can go, just all the tuning that Ed Logg put into that, is real artistry.'.


Asteroids is considered, artistically, to be a video-game masterpiece. Ed Logg opines : 'The simple fact that the spaceship in Asteroids continues to move after you cut thrust, providing a wee glimpse of the Newtonian mechanics of actual space flight, triggered the imaginations of many users'.


Rich Adam said : 'Asteroids fulfilled the fantasy of being out in space, with no gravity, and free floating. The spaceship had a very elegant grace. A lot of motion in the game had grace, even the way the boulders floated around.'.


And the game's epic quality was noted by Ed Rotberg : 'What Asteroids allows players to do is to put themselves in an incredible predicament, and then extricate themselves from it. You feel like a hero coming out of it.'.


There was a modified version of Asteroids that was given the nick-name "Turtleroids"; this was part of a long series of practical jokes against the vice-president of marketing for Atari who was feeling jaded in his feeling towards a game concept called 'Turtle Races'. One day, Ed switched the PROMs of the golden edition of Asteroids in the lobby of Atari so that the little and big UFOs were replaced by turtles, thus providing them with a constant reminder. Another practical joke involving Asteroids was a slight modification in the prototype of the game, because Owen Rubin (initials ORR on most Atari high score tables) kept filling up the high score tables when the programmers were not around. So, they modified the program to replace Owen's initials with Ed's own to keep him away.


In a monumental display of overconfidence on the part of the Atari programmers, Asteroids rolls over at only 99,999 points. Several players during days-long marathon games have scored over 100,000,000...


Asteroids keeps track of up to 255 extra men. If the player has too many, the game may slow down, probably due to the processor having to draw all the extra men on the screen.


Scott Safran holds the official record for this game with 41,336,440 points (!) on November 13, 1982.


An Italian bootleg released by Sidam is known as "Asterock". Another version is known as "Meteorites".


The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including ASTEROID.


Asteroids inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Hyperspace' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album.


An Asteroids unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1983 movie 'Terms of Endearment', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Night of the Comet', in the 1984 movie 'The Iceman', in the 1985 movie 'Remo Williams - The Adventure Begins' and in the 1983 movie 'The Adventures of Bob & Doug McKenzie - Strange Brew'.


An upright Asteroids unit appears in the 38 Speical music video 'Caught Up In You'.


- UPDATES -


The Rev.1 version had an invulnerability glitch, which allowed players to hide in the upper corners of the screen (in the score) and be invulnerable to collisions. Also, players could make their ship fly backwards by thrusting in one direction until reaching full speed, and then quickly turn around 180 degrees and continue thrusting.


The Rev.2 version says '1979 Atari' at the bottom of the title screen, instead of the 'Asteroids by Atari' that was displayed in Rev.1. Also, the invulnerability glitch of Rev.1 is corrected.


- SCORING -


Large Asteroids : 20 points.

Medium Asteroids : 50 points.

Small Asteroids : 100 points.

Large Saucer : 200 points.

Small Saucer : 1000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


When you start the game, your spaceship will be in the middle of the screen with 4 large asteroids heading toward your ship. After all the rocks are destroyed, the next round begins. The number of initial large asteroids depends on the round number :

Round 1 : 4

Round 2 : 6

Round 3 : 8

Round 4 : 10

Round 5 and up : 11


Your job is to blast those rocks. However, when you blast them, they break up into 2 medium rocks. Blasting a medium rock gives you 2 small rocks. Note : There is an exception to this rule. The game program only allows 26 asteroids on the screen at any one time. If the screen already contains 26 asteroids of any size, then when you shoot a large asteroid it breaks up into only one medium asteroid, and when you shoot a medium asteroid it breaks up into only one small asteroid. You can completely destroy a large asteroid with only 3 shots instead of 7 when the screen is filled up like this.


In addition, you have to contend with large and small saucers. On the first few screens, you can sit in the middle and blast rocks to your hearts content. There isn't that much danger since the large saucer doesn't track and only fires random shots. Keep in mind a couple of things when shooting :

1) You can have 4 shots on the screen at any one time. This is useful for when you are blasting rocks at close range. You can pretty much drill them to dust.

2) Your shots 'wrap around' the screen. This means any shot that goes past the edge of the screen will reappear on the opposite side traveling the same direction. The saucers also have 'wrap around' shots.


* After 10,000 points, the small saucer becomes a permanent part of the game. You can no longer sit in one place since the small saucer is able to track your ship and take you out with the first or second shot.


* Use hyperspace only in very desperate situations. Something like having 4 asteroids coming at you at once, and there is nowhere to escape would be a good reason. 8 times out of 10, hyperspace will either put your ship in danger or when you appear somewhere else, your ship will blow up.


* Although there is danger from the rocks and saucers, you can also be a danger to yourself. Use the thrust carefully or you will find yourself careening out of control on the screen. Some players get really good, however, moving around and shooting.


* For those desired high scores, you can use the hunting trick. It goes something like this :

1) After 10,000 points, the small saucers appear. They are worth 1000 points apiece. First, blast every rock until you have one small rocks left.

2) Go sit in the upper left or right corner of the game screen.

3) If the small saucer appears from the side you are on, then you can blast it before it gets off a shot. If it appears on the opposite side, use the shot 'wrap around' to take care of it. Some people have done this for hours on end and racked up scores in the millions. Of course, it takes a long time at 1000 points a pop.

4) Also keep in mind that the small saucer can wrap shots so you may have to move out of danger.

Asteroids Deluxe (c) 1981 Atari.


Atari's Asteroids Deluxe is a 1 or 2-player game with an X-Y or vector-generator monitor. The game depicts a 3rd-person view of a player's spaceship battling to destroy asteroids, flying saucers and enemy ships or 'death stars' (shaped like clusters of triangles). When hit, the asteroids and death stars will break into progressively smaller pieces.


Players can put up an octagon-shaped 'shield' to temporarily protect their spaceship. However, this shield wears out with use.


Large asteroids appear and drift in from the outer edges of the display. By pressing the ROTATE LEFT and ROTATE RIGHT pushbuttons on the control panel, the player may aim a spaceship toward any of the asteroids. The player uses the FIRE pushbutton to shoot at the asteroids and other objects.


When shot, each large asteroid divides into two medium-sized asteroids, and the game adds 20 points to the player's score. Medium-sized asteroids, when shot, divide into two small-sized asteroids, and the game awards 50 points to the player. When shot the smallest asteroid disappears and the game adds 100 points to the player's score.


In addition to asteroids, the players can score points for shooting the various enemy ships. When hit, the large ships ('death stars' shaped like hexagons) score 50 points and break into three diamond shapes. The medium-sized enemy or diamond, when hit, grants the player 100 points and breaks into two small triangular pieces. These small pieces disappear when the player hits them, and the score increases by 200 points.


At any time during game play, a flying saucer may appear from either side of the display. The game awards players 200 points for shooting a large saucer and 1000 points for a small saucer (the latter is a smaller target for players, though not any faster moving than the large one. It also shoots more accurately).


The player's objective in the game is to shoot and destroy as many asteroids, saucers, and enemy ships as possible before all his or her spaceships are destroyed. A ship is destroyed if an asteroid, saucer or enemy ship smashes into it, or if a flying saucer shoots it. To prevent losing a ship, the player may press the THRUST pushbutton to move out of the path of an oncoming object.


As an emergency maneuver, a player can press the SHIELDS pushbutton. An octagon will then appear around the player's ship as protection from all enemies. For challenge the shield power lasts only about 10 seconds, but the power is renewed with each ship. The amount of shielding power available is shown by the brightness of the octagon (dim means almost exhausted power).


CAST OF CHARACTERS :


Spaceship - This is you, the player. You can rotate 360 degrees, fire bullets, thrust forward in any direction, and use the shields if you feel you are in danger.


Large Asteroid - These are the large rocks that fill the screen at the beginning of each stage. Hitting one with a bullet will break it apart in to two Medium Asteroids.


Medium Asteroid - Slightly smaller than Large Asteroids, but faster moving, shooting one of these will result in two Small Asteroids.


Small Asteroid - These are the smallest and fastest rocks on the screen. If a bullet hits one of these, they will vaporize.


Hexagon - This addition to Asteroids appears when the stage is nearly free of rocks. It floats in one direction until it is shot.


Diamond - When the Hexagon is shot it breaks up in to 3 separate diamonds. These begin to track and slowly follow you.


Triangle - When a Diamond is shot it breaks up in to two separate triangles. These will move very quickly and zero in on you if you don't destroy them fast enough.


Large Saucer - Large flying saucers appear on the screen from time to time, randomly firing shots around the screen. Approximately one out of every 4 shots will be aimed directly at your ship. They will also target Hexagons if any are on the screen at the same time.


Small Saucer - The smaller saucers are more deadly than the large variety. They are much more precise with their shots, and are more likely to kill you. Eliminate them quickly or get out of their range.


- TECHNICAL -


This particular machine was released in 3 different formats; an upright, a cabaret, and a cocktail. With the upright being the most common, and the cabaret being the least common. All three versions were nearly pin compatible with an original "Asteroids" board-set, only a few wires had to be swapped.

* The upright was a rather interesting looking design that actually bulged out toward the player from the control panel on up. Atari went all out with the side-art on this one, it completely covers the sides from the floor to the top of the machine (it is a scene of a ship in an asteroid field, similar to the one on "Asteroids", but more detailed). The control panel layout is a little more subdued than the red, white, and blue monstrosity on the original "Asteroids". Just a dark surface, a few instructions, and some buttons (this title did not use a joystick, although it plays well with one).

* The cocktail version was almost identical in appearance to the original "Asteroids" cocktail (and just about every other Atari cocktail). It was black and woodgrain, with only a minimum of ornamentation behind the glass.

* The cabaret version (a cabaret is a mini upright that is less than 5 feet tall), is an ugly little creature, with woodgrain sides and a black front. The nameplate is down low on the machine near the coin mechs (which makes the game hard to identify at first).


* Upright dimensions : 71in. (180,34cm) high x 26,75in. (67,95cm) wide x 25,25in. (64,14cm) deep. Weight : 313 lbs (140,85 kg). Monitor : 19in. QuadraScan.

* Cabaret dimensions : 54,25in. (137,79cm) high x 20,44in. (51,91cm) wide x 23,75in. (60,32cm) deep. Weight : 193 lbs (86,85 kg). Monitor : 15in. QuadraScan.

* Cocktail dimensions : adujstable from 21,5in. to 27in. high x 32in. (80,5cm) wide x 24in. (60cm) deep. Weight : 164 lbs (73,8 kg). Monitor : 15in. Quadrascan.

- TRIVIA -


Released in March 1981.


The original "Asteroids" proved to be wildly popular, but there was one problem. The game was simply too easy for expert players (many people could play for hours on a single quarter). So Atari decided to make a more difficult sequel, Asteroids Deluxe. They succeeded a little too well, and had to scale the difficulty back after their initial version proved to be too difficult for the average player. This game was created out of modified "Asteroids" code. At the same time this game was being produced, "Space Duel" was in the works, but was shelved as Asteroids Deluxe was green-lighted for production. Despite its similarities to the hugely popular original, Asteroids Deluxe was a commercial flop and Atari later released "Space Duel" to moderate success.


Asteroids Deluxe features modified game-play intentionally designed to challenge players who had mastered the original Asteroids : 

1) The addition of new ships. When hit, the large ships ('death stars' shaped like hexagons) break into 3 diamond shapes. The medium-sized enemy or diamond, when hit, breaks into two small triangular pieces. These small pieces disappear when the player hits them. The diamond and triangular ships pursue the player's ship until killed.

2) The small and large UFO's have been improved :

a) Their shots now 'wrap-around' the screen. This means that a shot fired off the right or left side will re-enter the screen on the left or right side.

b) The accuracy of the large UFO's shots have been improved. Now every one out of four shots are aimed at the player's spaceship. If there are no other targets, all shots go toward the player's spaceship.

3) The players' ship was redesigned to include two side fins and a narrower body, keeping the overall ship dimensions identical to the original game. The ship has the same maximum velocity as in Asteroids, but can accelerate twice as fast.

4) The high score now 'rolls over' at 999,999 points instead of 99,999 points.

5) A graphic overlay has been added to give the game more of a feeling of depth. It also makes it slightly harder to see the vector graphics.

6) The hyperspace button has been replaced by a shield. The shield lasts 10-12 seconds per spaceship and cannot be recharged.

7) Firing is now automatic, holding down the fire button will release a maximum of four shots (on screen) at a time.


Although the attract screen claims a 1980 copyright, the game was officially introduced in March of 1981. The front glass on the upright was originally square with the cabinet - this produced an unpleasant 'glare' on the screen. Atari later released a 'glare reduction kit' which provided an angled glass frontage to be fitted onto the cabinet thereby reducing the glare. Once applied, the kit enclosed the speaker which resulted in deeper base tones.


Approximately 22,300 units were produced.


Leo Daniels holds the official record for this game with 2,240,120 points.


An Asteroids Deluxe unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Tron', in the 1982 movie 'The Thing' and in the 1984 movie 'Night of the Comet'.


An Asteroids Deluxe upright cabinet appears in the Judas Priest music video 'Freewheel Burning'.


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".


- UPDATES -


There are two versions of the software; the original release proved to be so difficult that Atari released a revised version that had easier game-play. This new version was originally introduced in Europe and is often referred to as the 'European Version'. Determining the version  can be discerned by noting the first appearance of a 'death star' - in the original version this is near the end of the second wave; in the revised version it appears near the end of the first wave and moves much more slowly.

Large Asteroids : 20 points

Medium Asteroids : 50 points

Small Asteroids : 100 points


'Death Star' (Hexagon Shaped Ship) A.K.A. 'Snowflake' : 50 points

* When you start the game, your spaceship will be in the middle of the screen with 4 large asteroids heading toward your ship. After all the rocks are destroyed, the next round begins. The number of initial large asteroids depends on the round number :

Round 1 : 4

Round 2 : 5

Round 3 : 6

Round 4 : 7

Round 5 : 8 

Round 6 and up : 9


Your job is to blast those rocks, however, when you blast them, they break up into 2 medium rocks. Blasting a medium rock gives you 2 small rocks. Note : There is an exception to this rule. The game program only allows 24 asteroids on the screen at any one time. If the screen already contains 24 asteroids of any size, then when you shoot a large asteroid it breaks up into only one medium asteroid, and when you shoot a medium asteroid it breaks up into only one small asteroid. You can completely destroy a large asteroid with only 3 shots instead of 7 when the screen is filled up like this.


In addition, you have to contend with large and small saucers and the 'death stars'. On the first couple of screens, you can sit in the middle and blast rocks. Be aware that a saucer will enter which will cause you to move lest you be hit by its shots. In addition :

1) You can have 4 shots on the screen at any one time. This is useful for when you are blasting rocks at close range. You can pretty much drill them to dust.

2) Your shots 'wrap around' the screen. This means any shot that goes past the edge of the screen will reappear on the opposite side traveling the same direction. The saucers also have 'wrap around' shots.


* After 10,000 points, the small saucer becomes a permanent part of the game. You can no longer sit in one place since the small saucer is able to track your ship and take you out with the first or second shot.


* Your shields have a maximum life expectancy of 17 seconds. Each collision with a rock takes away about 6 seconds of shield time. Once your shield runs down, it can not be recharged. In other words : use your shields as little as possible.


* Although there is danger from the rocks and saucers, you can also be a danger to yourself. Use the thrust carefully or you will find yourself careening out of control on the screen. Some players get really good, however, moving around and shooting.


* For those desired high scores, you can use the hunting trick. It goes something like this :

1) After 10,000 points, the small saucers appear. They are worth 1000 points apiece. First, blast every rock until you have one small rock left.

2) Go sit in the upper left or right corner of the game screen.

3) If the small saucer appears from the side you are on, then you can blast it before it gets off a shot.  If it appears on the opposite side, use the shot 'wrap around' to take care of it. Some people have done this for hours on end and racked up scores in the millions. Of course, it takes a long time at 1000 points a pop.

4) Also keep in mind that the small saucer can wrap shots so you may have to move out of danger.

5) Unlike in "Asteroids", the small saucers fire a greater number of shots so hunting is more of a challenge.

6) After 60,000 points, the accuracy of both UFO's goes up dramatically.


* The 'death stars' make their appearance in either the first or second wave :

1) It appears on the screen just lazily floating around. It can only be broken open by laser fire (yours or the saucer's).

2) Once open, the pieces pursue the player. Hitting one of the diamond-shaped pieces breaks it into two triangular pieces.

3) The best way to defeat this enemy is to accelerate forward, then turn quickly while shooting. This causes you to fly backwards while shooting at the pieces.

Astro Blaster (c) 1981 Sega.


Astro Blaster is a 1- or 2-player game in which players must advance through squadrons of alien ships in an attempt to dock with the mother ship. Players move their ship left or right and shoot at attacking squadrons. A special time warp allows the player to slow down the alien space ships and their laser fire, while maintaining his own ship and laser fire at normal speed.


As players go through the game play, each step is directed by the voice of mission control. Mission control keeps players informed of fuel status, provides a countdown on warp, keeps track of the number of ships remaining, and monitors the player's laser temperature.


As players enter each new sector they encounter a different number of alien squadrons. Players must destroy all ships in each squadron to pass through the sector. One squadron of rockets is extremely difficult to destroy, but players can pass through this squadron by hitting a few enemy ships. Once a player has destroyed all the squadrons in that sector, he enters an asteroid belt. He must maneuver and shoot his way through the asteroids to reach the mother ship. If fuel is critically low when the player enters the asteroid belt, he can receive extra fuel by shooting the red fireballs interspersed among the asteroids. After passing through the asteroid belt, the player's ship docks with the mother ship and refuels.


There are 29 different alien squadrons players encounter as they move through the different sectors. Every new sector increases in difficulty with different numbers of squadrons in each sector. Each alien ship has its own individualized sounds, movements and firing capability.


During their game, players must keep track of fuel consumption. As the player's ship moves through the sector, it consumes fuel. The player must ensure he has enough fuel to advance through the sector and dock with the mother ship. Extra fuel can only be obtained by shooting red fireballs or docking with the mother ship. The screen also displays the laser temperature. As players fire, the laser temperature rises. When they cease firing it cools down. If the laser overheats, players lose their laser fire until it cools down.


By depressing the warp button, players slow down the enemy ships and their laser fire while maintaining his own at normal speed. Players receive one warp per ships and are awarded one warp upon docking, if he has used his warp in the previous sector.


Each alien ship destroyed carries a different point value. Players also receive double points for destroying an alien ship when their fuel is in the red. To add further excitement, there are 25 tasks that a player performs during the course of the game and receives a secret bonus. Players do not know what these tasks are, but a good player will keep track. The 25 tasks are consistent throughout the game. Players also receive a bonus for any fuel they have left when they dock with the mother ship.


With a two-player game, players alternate at the conclusion of each sector, not after each ship.  Players receive 3 to 5 ships, which is operator adjustable. The game is over when a player runs out of fuel, loses all his ships, or crashes while attempting to dock with the mother ship. The top three scores are displayed and the game ranks players from 1 to 99.


PLAY INSTRUCTIONS :

1. Shoot enemy space ships for points.

2. Shoot fire balls for extra fuel.

3. Use warp to slow down enemy ships and bombs (only once per sector or ship).

4. Discover how to earn secret bonuses for extra points.

5. Dock with mother ship to refuel after each sector.

6. Game over when you run out of ships or fuel.

7. Laser will not fire while overheated.

Released during March 1981.


Astro Blaster was one of the big contributions from Sega/Gremlin. Utilizing speech synthesis, the game attracted players by stating 'Fighter pilots needed in sector wars, play Astro Blaster'. During game play, the game gave you different advice such as 'Alert, alert, invaders in sector 1, player 1 to battle stations', 'Fuel status marginal', or 'Warp activated, 10, 9, 8,...' to name a few.


Astro Blaster wasn't the first game to introduce speech synthesis in a game, that honor goes to Taito's "Stratovox". Astro Blaster, though, challenged the player to go through seven sectors with a varying amount of waves within each sector. Astro Blaster was an extremely challenging game, it developed a solid following. It wasn't as popular as "Frogger", which was released later on, but it still had a solid showing and redefined how space shooters could be made more challenging. Other notable games released in this year were "Donkey Kong", "Galaga", "Vanguard", and "Wizard of Wor".


The bonuses in this game were actually bugs that would appear if certain events took place. Rather than 'fix' the bugs, Gary Shannon changed them to bonus 'features'.


Gus Pappas holds the official record for this game with 299,100 points on November 20, 1982.


In Sega's Dreamcast 1999 video game 'Shenmue', an Astro Blaster cabinet can be seen in the YOU Arcade in Dobuita, but it has an 'out of order' label on it and is not playable. Its possible it was originally playable and had to be removed for some reason, but it is perhaps there simply for the sake of realism; Shenmue is set in 1986/87, so even then it would be considered an old game.


- UPDATES -


3 versions of Astro Blaster were released. The first version was deemed too difficult to play. Version 2 was released to remedy this situation and to be a little more descriptive in the games instructions. Version 3 was basically the EASY version of Astro Blaster. All 3 versions had some things in common :

1) All the different alien spacecraft were in all of the versions, it was just their order of appearance that made a difference.

2) The secret bonuses were common to all three versions. Just because a sector had different waves didn't mean the bonuses for specific events were changed.

3) Each had a high score table that held the 99 top scores.


It was easy to spot a version one machine. The instructions were displayed on the screen. When you inserted your money, you just had to press the 1- or 2-player button to start the game.


On versions 2 and 3, after you inserted your money, a blue screen came up and basically told you to press the 1- or 2-player button.. It also explained some of the rules while in attract mode. The order of the alien attackers is what determined version two and three.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your star ship will be in the middle of the screen. The computer voice will state 'Alert, alert, invaders sector 1, player 1, battle stations'. With that, you are ready to rock and roll. Before you start your game, be sure of what version machine you are playing so you can get yourself prepared. Since each version alters the order of the aliens, it's not good to be prepared for one attack and a totally different attack comes along.


* Although the computer voice can be annoying at times, it also gives you very valuable information. This will actually help you to concentrate more on destroying aliens then constantly looking at your gauges. Some helpful things the voice will tell you are :

1) When your fuel status hits marginal and critical.

2) When your laser temperature is approaching critical.

3) The countdown after you activate warp.


* Fuel is a very precious commodity in this game. If you run out of fuel, your game is over regardless of how many star ships you have left. Learn how to maximize your fuel usage because in the later sectors that have a lot of waves, you will be running on empty. Some other fuel facts :

1) When you activate warp, only the enemies on the screen slow down. Your fuel supply continues to burn away in REAL time.

2) When fuel status marginal is announced, you have approximately 25 seconds of fuel remaining.

3) When fuel status critical is announced, you have approximately 8 seconds of fuel remaining.

4) Shooting the fireballs in the asteroid wave will get you 3 more seconds of fuel.

5) You score double points during fuel status critical.

6) At the end of each sector, you will be re-fueled when you dock with the mothership.

7) Losing a star ship doesn't replenish your fuel supply.


* The warp button can be a blessing or a curse depending on how you use it. You only get one warp per sector or one per star ship. This works fine on the lower sectors that only have a few waves. On the higher sectors, though, you must plan (if possible) the best place to utilize it. Some tips :

1) If it is used on an enemy that goes across the screen, wait until they are halfway across before activating the warp. This way, you can get them all before your warp time runs out.

2) If used on the diagonal flying aliens, again, wait until a lot of them are out before activating.

3) For other aliens, make sure they are mostly on the screen. Sometimes, these aliens disappear off screen and if you activated your warp too early, it will be wasted while they hang around outside of the playing area.


* There are no safe places in this game so you must always be on the look out for not only the aliens dropping on you, but also their laser fire.


* Speaking of laser fire, your ship is equipped with a powerful laser cannon.  There is no limit to the amount of shots you can fire, but there is a catch.  The cannon heats up with each shot fired. It will overheat if you fire too many shots too quickly, and you will have to wait about eight seconds for it to cool off before you can fire it again. Some ways to prevent overheating :

1) Make your shots count. Don't hold down the fire button to take out the aliens. Shoot to kill, not to warn.

2) If you must do multiple shots, do it in short bursts. Your laser heats up much faster then it cools down.

3) If you do overheat, just avoid the aliens and their fire until your laser is operational again.


* Docking is the easiest way to get a lot of points. You need to set yourself up after the last of the asteroids in order to get those points. Moving your ship during docking procedures will prevent you from getting any docking bonus. The most points are from the 'Paint Scraper' method : Line up your left engine over the C in SECTOR. It will look like you will collide with the left docking arm but you will barely squeeze by. Thus, you now have 1,500 points.


* Also, if you destroy your star ship during docking, your game will be over regardless of the number of men you have left.


* Always expect the unexpected in this game. Sometimes the aliens will do things or make moves you haven't seen before. The best way to counter this is to always be on guard.


* After sector seven, the sectors repeat again. Also, the score 'rolls over' at 99,990. Many players will intentionally get themselves killed when they get close to this score in order to claim the number one position on the board.

Astro Fighter [Upright model] (c) 1979 Data East.


Astro Fighter is a 2-D, space shooter style game. Your job is to protect the various sectors from the hoards of invading aliens. You will have to defeat 4 waves of alien spaceships in order to dock with the 'GS' ship and refuel. In addition to battling the alien spaceships, you will also have to dodge bombs that seem to come out of nowhere. Armed only with your fighter and a lot of spirit, you must ensure that you clear the screen of invaders before they pass you by. All in all, another walk in the park.

This is the first game manufactured by Data East. Astro Fighter came as a result of a merging of ideas between Sega and Data East. Unfortunately, this game wasn't well received and didn't sell many units. Sega would improve on the overall design and release "Astro Blaster", which was a superior game in every way to this one. Astro Fighter, though, was still a challenging game and a definite departure from the standard 'shoot'em up' type of space games, it just never caught on.


David Nelson of Derry, New Hampshire, holds the official record for this game with 37,150 points on May 31, 2008.


An Astro Fighter unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Rocky III'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your fighter will be in the middle at the bottom of the screen. The alien spaceships have two ways they shoot at your fighter. They either shoot straight down or they shoot diagonally. You must take out all the alien spaceships on a screen. If you fail to do so, you will have to deal with their full complement again and your fighter will be set at the next higher level. If you happen to get killed during a wave, you only have to deal with the remaining alien spaceships.


* Fuel is a precious commodity in this game. You may be able to let one or two waves of aliens escape but you will really be pressed to finish the entire round with enough fuel. If your fuel runs out, your game is over regardless of how many fighters you have left.


* You can only have one shot on the screen at a time. This means you will need to plan your shots and don't fire unless you need to.


* The first four waves of alien spaceships, come down in distinct formations. Understanding how these formations are set up is the key to taking them out quickly.

1) The Blue Aliens come down in a 'pyramid-type' formation. Starting from the bottom, the numbers are five at the bottom, three at the next level, two at the next level, and one at the top.

2) The Purple Aliens come down in two straight lines. With six in the bottom line and six in the top line.

3) The Green Aliens come down in a haphazard-type formation. They move back and forth across the screen and they are the hardest spaceships to deal with.

4) The Yellow Aliens come down in three rows with five spaceships per row.


* As you shoot the alien formations, you will notice that the remaining alien spaceships will speed up. The key is to shoot them high up on the screen so that you are not desperately trying to take out the last ones at the bottom. This also means taking out the bottom attackers first to give yourself some 'breathing' room.


* In addition to the alien spaceships, you must be wary of the bombs that drop down. When you are lining up your shots at the alien spaceships, always be aware of where the bombs may be heading and act accordingly.


* On the fifth wave, you will have to deal with the 'GS' mother ship. Its shots are pretty easy to avoid and it must be hit dead center to stop it, collect the points, and refuel your fighter for the next round.


* There is a 10k bonus trick.  Normally, if you hit the GS mother ship with your first shot you get 950 points, otherwise you get 300 points. However, if you miss with your first shot and then destroy it with your 55th shot (counting from the beginning of the level, or when you start with a new ship) you get 10,000 points!  There are 4 waves per level - 11 enemies on the 1st, 12 on the 2nd and 3rd, and 15 on the 4th (50 total), so you can miss 3 times (or hit bombs) before you reach the mother ship.

Astro Invader (c) 1980 Stern Electronics.


Astro Invader is a simple 2-D shooter. You control your laser base against an endless stream of alien invaders. The invaders don't come in set waves, instead, they come in a constant stream. Once you have gotten through one barrage of aliens, more are just behind to continue the action. Your job is to keep them from overwhelming you with their superiority in numbers. Kill or be killed, that is the objective.


Astro Invader is one of the follow-up games that rode on the wave of the "Space Invaders" craze. The game itself is simple in concept but the action gets fast paced, real quickly. Especially since several things can be going on at the same time during the game.

This game is also known as "Kamikaze" (Leijac).


Although all the screen colors are generated by the game's hardware as opposed to a screen overlay, there are varying bands of color dependent upon where the aliens are displayed vertically. At different heights, the aliens and their saucers are displayed in various colors. When a player's ship is destroyed, the entire display is drawn in red.


This game appears in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers music video for the song 'You Got Lucky' (1982).

- SCORING -


Alien spacecraft, not moving, in their stalls : 10 points

Alien spacecraft moving into stalls or dropping toward you : 20 points

UFO : 100, 200, 300, or 400 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your base will be in the middle, at the bottom of the screen in the area in between the stalls. When the game starts, a large UFO will enter the top of the screen. It will have the number 200 in it. That is how many alien spacecraft that 'mother' ship is going to attack you with. The 'mother' ship will land on the platform and the game will commence or continue. When the 'mother' ship expends all 200 of its ships, all gameplay freezes and a new 'mother' ship will enter with 200 more alien spacecraft. This cycle will keep going until you lose all of your bases.


* A stall will hold 4 invaders. If you haven't reduced that number down, the 5th invader on will drop to the ground.  When an invader hits the ground, it just doesn't hit, it produces a blast radius a little wider then the stall it fell from. Your laser base can be destroyed by this 'indirect' fire.


* Just as deadly are the UFO's that show up. They can appear out of any of the open areas (as denoted in the playing field). They don't shoot or look threatening. The problem is, when they land on the ground, your base will be destroyed.


* The ''mother'' ship starts to distribute invaders starting with stall number 1 and works from left to right. Then it works from right to left and so on. The pattern is like this:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2...  As you can see, the right side will fill up quicker if you don't act quickly. This only works on odd numbered boards. On the even numbered boards, the 'mother' ship will stack the invaders on the same side as your laser base.


* The best strategy for this game is to keep the middle as open as possible. Keep stalls 4, 5, 6, and 7 as cleared of invaders as possible. Prevent these stalls from building up there maximum of 4 invaders. This will give you some breathing room plus it will help when dealing with the UFO's that come down on the left or right sides.


* There is a pattern on how the invaders are distributed. Use this knowledge when you are moving along the bottom of the screen. If you have stalls topped off and invaders are dropping, watch which way the 'mother' ship is distributing the aliens. If it is from right to left, then the aliens will fall from the farthest stall away from you and come inward. If it is from left to right, then the invaders will fall away from you. This is good if you are trying to make it to one side or the other to know how the invaders are falling.


* You can shoot the aliens that are falling but keep in mind, there probably is another that is on the left or right side that will hit the ground. Given that the blast radius is wider then the stall, it's better to let it go. Just keep the stalls (especially 4, 5, 6, and 7) cleared as best as possible.


* When the 'mother' ship is down to its last few invaders, make sure you are not in a position to get blasted the moment the new 'mother' ship arrives to continue the action. Nothing like having an falling invader inches from your laser base and the action pauses only to unpause and you get your base destroyed.


* Although the UFO seems to come out at random times and places, there does appear to be a pattern. It seems to come down the center mostly but it also has a pattern as to when it comes down the right and left sides.

Ataxx (c) 1991 Leland.


The object of the game is to fill the 7x7 tiled board with your colored globs. This is done by moving your glob adjacent to your opponent's glob and turning it to your color. 2 types of moves can be made during the game : first, placing a glob adjacent to one of your own duplicates it; or second, a glob may jump two spaces, but it will not be duplicated. The number and arrangement of obstacles in the playfield changes between each round, so strategies must be changed in order to accomodate these barriers.


Eventually, all the empty spaces on the board are filled, and the player with the most colored globs wins. In single-player mode if the human player wins, they must face a more difficult computer opponent in the next round. The game is over when time runs out, regardless if you're winning or not. You can 'buy-in' at any time.

This is a pretty hard platform game where you take the role of Athena fighting your way through different worlds inhabitated by all kinds of different enemies, ranging from moving pears to huge golems and flying devils.


You start out with nothing more than your feet to fight with and no more protection than Athena's underwear (she actually loses her dress in the intro to the first world) but can collect a huge number of different weapons and armour, as well as a great number of power-ups ranging from the usual more-power-for weapon or armour, through boots that allow her to jump higher and wings for flying, to one where Athena becomes a semi-god and actually growths to twice her usual size and gets a huge burning sword and full armour.


The worlds are filled with stone blocks that can be smashed when searching for secrets and items, as well as several levels connected by ladders or other means of transportation.


Athena is a great game, and will give even the most hardened platform-player a real challenge, for it is NOT an easy game, even with the dip switches in 'Easy' mode.

The main character, Athena, appears in The King of Fighters series.


The 'Athena' logo on the title screen appears in 1991's "Sengoku" by SNK. In level 2, there is a store called 'Boutique Athena' in the background with the original 'Athena' logo.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Test mode : hold START during machine boot.


* Something not found in the manual to this game is that there exists a 'secret' mode of the game - if you set dip switch 7 of bank 2 to 'ON' you will get one life less than usual (2 instead of 3 or 5), but the life meter will start at 22 and not 12 or 14 which is the standard. This will make the game much more interesting.


* Every time you die you loose every equipment you collected up to that point, unless you also have a 'K' Item in your inventory. If you have it, when you die you will only loose the 'K' but keep the rest of the items.


* There is a secret level that can be reached collecting a magic key on the Ice, Hell or Sky world. Other may exists. This world is called 'World of Labirinth'. 

When you complete the 'world of labirinth', you will meet an angel. Do NOT attack her, but wait until she drops an harp. If you collect it, it will work as a perpetual 'K' item, and you will never loose your items again when you die.


* When you complete the 'World of labirinth', you will be returned to the level following to the one you picked up the key on.

Avalanche (c) 1978 Atari.


Avalanche is a 2-D game of skill. You control a multi-storied platform with a spinner-knob. Your goal is to prevent the falling rocks from ever reaching the ground. There are six rows of rocks to deal with. You start with a 6-storied platform and you lose one platform per row of rocks cleared. You score points for those rocks you prevent from reaching the ground. Of course, the farther the row of rocks, the smaller and faster they become. Your ultimate goal is to get enough points so that you can continue your game should you lose your first one. Get your hard hat out and prepare to catch some rogue rocks.

Avalanche shipped in a cool looking black and white cabinet. It has three-color painted sideart which shows a group of falling boulders. This title does not have a marquee, instead the monitor bezel extends all the way to the top of the cabinet (this game was seldom converted because of that). The monitor bezel is decorated with a brownish scene of dirt and rocks, and has a clear semi-circular are that shows the black and white monitor within. The game uses a set of color overlays to simulate color on the otherwise monochrome screen. The control panel is decorated with a brown overlay showing large cracks in the earth, and it has a single optical spinner mounted in the center, with buttons far off to each side.


- TRIVIA -


Released in April 1978.


1978 proved to be a pivotal year in the arcade industry. Atari was still the big name in arcade games, but that title would soon be threatened. A relatively unknown company out of Japan called Taito partnered up with the well known company Midway in the United States. The game that took the world by storm was called "Space Invaders". It proved to be such a huge success, quarter shortages were reported due to all the gameplay. This also meant that other arcades that came out during 1978 received significantly less patronage. Therefore, Avalanche didn't do very well at the arcades. Many of Atari's games from this period were based more on the skill of the player then anything else. Although Atari released many memorable arcade games after this period, times would never be the same. With the big videogame collapse during the early 80's coupled with poor management, Atari started a downward spiral it would never recover from.


This game was released by Sidam as "Cascade".


David Nelson of holds the official record for this game with 2,453 points on March 21, 2004.


- SCORING -


The score for each rock corresponds to its row number. Rows are numbered 1-6 starting from the lowest row and moving up. Therefore, the rocks values are :

Row 1 : 1 point

Row 2 : 2 points

Row 3 : 3 points

Row 4 : 4 points

Row 5 : 5 points

Row 6 : 6 points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, you will see six rows of rocks. Each row contains 32 rocks in it. At the bottom of the screen you will have your six-story platform to catch the falling rocks. Gameplay starts as soon as you press the SERVE button or after five seconds, whichever comes first. First, you must know how the game works so you can better play it :

1) You start with a six-story platform. Each time a row of 32 rocks is cleared (either by you catching it or it hits the ground), you lose one story and the remaining platform(s) become shorter.

2) Every two rows of rocks (64 rocks) become smaller then the previous two rows. In addition, they travel faster down toward your platform(s).

3) If you happen to clear out all six rows of rocks, the game will reload the top with more rocks. You will now start with a three-story platform. If you clear those rows, it will be a two-story platform. The final re-loading of rocks will give you a single platform to catch rocks with. You can only have a maximum of three rock refills (not counting the initial rocks at the beginning of the game).


* The maximum score you can get on each level is 687 points.


* When you are playing the game, only concentrate on catching the rocks with your bottom platform. If you have a multi-storied platform, you will catch a lot of the rocks before they even reach the bottom platform. Of course, in the later rows, this won't be the case.


* If you happen to get a miss, all the rocks that were falling will be placed back at the top (including the one you missed).


* Learn not to spin the control knob. This prevents you from losing control of where your platform is.  Instead, learn how to turn it gently to where you need to go. There is enough time to move from side to side.


* Speaking of placement, always try to keep near the middle. That way you can react faster to where the rocks are falling instead of going all the way left or right all the time.


* Whenever you either clear a screen or get enough points for extended play, there is a couple of second delay while the board sets up.

Avenging Spirit (c) 1991 Jaleco.


While walking out with his girlfriend the game's hero is ambushed by unknown enemies who snatch his girlfriend and shoot the hero dead. Now, as a wandering spirit with the ability to possess almost anybody he comes across, the hero is summoned by his girlfriend's father and given a mission to save her from the mysterious crime syndicate that holds her hostage. Only then can the hero rest in peace.


The player's character 'inhabits' a body with which to combat the game's enemies. When that body is killed, providing there is a living enemy nearby (other than that of a boss) the player can posses them and continue playing. Each time this is done, it costs the player some of their 'spirit energy'. Should the hero die when there are no enemies close by for the player to possess; the game is over.

Aztarac (c) 1983 Centuri.


The actual game has you piloting a little space tank. The tank and its turret are controlled independently, which allows you to move in one direction while shooting in another. Your mission is to guard various space outposts from hordes of incoming enemy ships. Each level will have several outposts all clustered together in the center. If an enemy ship touches an outpost, then the outpost is destroyed. You can activate a long range scanner by using your second button. This allows you to locate enemies before they get close, that way you can fly off and get them before they even have a shot at the outposts.


- TECHNICAL -


Aztarac was only available in an upright dedicated cabinet. You might remember this title as the game that had a round plastic bubble over the monitor. Basically the monitor bezel stuck out towards the player. This provided a nice 'warp' effect on the center area of the game. The marquee simply had a yellow 'Aztarac' logo floating over a blue grid. The control panel had similar grid graphics and featured an analog joystick that had two buttons, along with an optical spinner. The sideart on this title was a painted Aztarac logo, along with a geometric spaceship, and a whole bunch of stripes. This sideart is easily repaintable due to the simple design. It has been said that only 500 units were built.

- TRIVIA -


This is the second and last Vector based game ever produced by Centuri.


Here is a copy of an original game proposal document by Tim Stryker : Defend the starbase from alien invaders (sounds really novel so far, right?). Ship is maneuverable in two dimensions, has laser weaponry, and can use radar to locate menacing planetoids and enemy squadrons. Enemy squadrons come in two flavors : slow, Space-Invader-like phalanxes of twenty to forty ships bearing rockets, and fast, elite loners bearing lasers. Field of play (the simulated 'universe') is considerably larger than what can be seen on the screen at any one time : the player's ship is always displayed at the center of the screen and only 'sees' the portion of the universe within a given radius about its current position. Enemy ships attack from random points around the compass, bent on destroying the starbase, but will engage the player's ship if it presents itself. Ship has limited fuel and laser energy, but may return to starbase to refuel and recharge at any time. Points are awarded for each enemy craft destroyed, and are deducted for each defending ship lost. Game ends when starbase is destroyed by enemy; limitation of playing time is achieved through gradual escalation of enemy attacks.


Tim committed suicide in the Blue Mountains of Colorado in August of 1996 for unknown reasons. On the night of Aug. 6, Tim Stryker, 41, pulled off a remote road in the Blue Mountains in northwest Colorado, stepped out of his car, put a shotgun to his head and pulled the trigger.


Dennis Bartlett holds the official record for this game with 142,390 points on February 11, 1984.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Programmer's name : spinning the spinner at a high rate during parts of the attract-mode will result in the programmer's name (Tim Stryker) appearing in approximately 3-inch-high letters across the center of the screen.

- TRIVIA -


Released in April 1988.


This game is known in Japan as "Dragonninja".


'Bad Dudes' acquired something of a cult status, due in no small part to its tongue-in-cheek humour; such as the game's introduction by a Secret Service agent informing the player that 'President Ronnie has been kidnapped by the Ninjas. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue Ronnie?' After saving the President, Reagan appears in the Oval Office and delivers the line : 'Hey Dudes Thanks, for rescuing me, let's go for a burger...'.


The game includes a cameo appearance by "Karnov" (a hero in his own Data East game), who oddly enough, appears as an enemy boss rather than the good guy this time around!


The trucks on the second stage say 'Kikuchi Co., Ltd'. Kikuchi Co is a real company established on November 1953 in Japan. It manufactures and sells automobile body frame components and it is affiliated to Honda.


Polystar / Datam released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Deco History Scene I : Data East Game Music Scene One - H25X-20008) on 25/09/1988.


A Bad Dudes vs. Dragonninja unit appears in the 1990 movie 'Robocop 2', and in the 1989 movie "Parenthood".

It has been 50 years since the nuclear disaster. The sport of sprint racing is now a ruthless battle between armed cars. These races take place on tracks built in the ruins of the dangerous nuclear zone known only as the BADLANDS. It's all-out war on the track as players blast away at the drones (and each other) to finish first. Players shoot play-field targets for extra points and bonus missiles.


Bonus wrenches appear at regular intervals which can be collected and used to upgrade the player's vehicle. The available upgrades are : missiles, tires, turbo, increased speed, and shields. This was to be Atari's last game in the 'Sprint' series.

First driving game 'kit' for the arcade.


Unlike its 2 most famous prequels, "Championship Sprint" and "Super Sprint", Bad Lands used a standard resolution monitor instead of the medium resolution monitor used in the past. This means the cars are somewhat larger and, because of this scale issue, the tracks feel smaller and more cramped than in other games in the series. As a result of this, only 3 cars compete, instead of the 4 vehicles that appeared in earlier games.


Bad Lands re-uses some of the sounds from Championship Sprint and Super Sprint, particularly notable when bonus wrenches are collected.


Gary Hatt holds the official record for this game with 146,080 points on June, 26, 1986.

Bank Panic (c) 1984 Sega.


A reaction-based shoot-em-up in which the player takes on the role of a gun-slinging Deputy, who has been charged with protecting the town bank from outlaws.


Each stage contains 12 numbered doors, with 3 doors visable on-screen at any one time. The player must scroll the screen left or right to bring other doors into view. At regular intervals, one or more doors will open to reveal either a bank customer or an outlaw. The customers must be allowed to deposit their money unharmed while the outlaws must be shot before they have a chance to shoot the deputy. Some of the outlaws must be shot twice before they are killed. If the players kills an innocent citizen, a player life is lost.


Doors will only open when they are on-screen and a level is only completed once cash has been deposited safely into the bank via each of the 12 doors. Each level has a tight time limit so it's important to ensure that the player reaches the doors that are about to be opened as quickly as possible. Imminent visitors are indicated by the presence of a bar graph that sits above each door, with a red marker indicating an approaching customer or robber.


In addition to the outlaws, players must also be wary of time bombs that occasionally appear on one of the doors; this is indicated by both a timer and an icon above the door with the bomb. The bomb must be reached and shot before the timer runs out. As well as the outlaws and customers, a small, bandy-legged cowboy occasionally appears holding gifts above his head, these can be shot for bonus points.

Robber Bosses must be shot twice to be killed - you get two scores based on the time of each hit.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Try to always allow a gunman to draw, as you only score 100 points if he doesn't. If two or more gunmen appear take one out straight away, as it is a lot more difficult to kill more than one when they draw.


* You don't have to shoot the little guy with the hat an exact number of times, just once for each hat or more. So fire as many times as you can and you will get the bonus points.


* You should try to defuse bombs as soon as possible.


* Doors cannot be opened while you are moving, so move directly to the door you require without stopping.


* Watch the indicators above the door numbers to see which doors will be opening soon. If there are two next to each other, try to get only one of them on screen so you do not have to possibly contend with more than one gunman simultaneously.


- PORTS -


* Consoles :

Sega Master System (1987) : This port is more of a remake than a port. The scoring is very different, and it is nearly impossible to get past level 14 due to the insane speed of the shooters! The instruction booklet also has an incorrectly placed screenshot of the arcade version on page 9, and the instructions are based on the arcade version instead, making it mostly incorrect for this version.

This game is also known as "Alien Sector".


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Another item that can be found inside the capsules is the ray gun, which will upgrade Kissy's ray gun to a higher power level, allowing him to kill the enemies quicker. But when he is hit, his ray gun power level will decrease by one.


* The bonus game can be very tricky. If you save a Paccet on a regular floor, you will have any amount of Paccets from 1 to 8 (depending on how many you have saved) in the bonus game. This will increase your chances of getting an extra shield. If you have 8 Paccets, you'll definitely get an extra shield in the bonus game. Every time you get a Paccet in the bonus game, you'll get an extra shield but lose all your Paccets and you'll have to start saving them again.


* If you have Paccets on a boss floor, they will sacrifice themselves to help Kissy by throwing themselves at the boss for him. The boss will be stunned for a few seconds, which allows you to get in some free shots.


* On some floors, the ground and walls have invisible holes in them. These can help Kissy get away from the enemies. And if a projectile fired by an enemy hits a wall or the ground, it will dissipate.

Barrier (c) 1979 Vectorbeam.


The basic idea behind Barrier is that you have to move your little marker to the end of a grid, while avoiding the other markers. Actually that is the only idea. The game is played on a 3x9 grid that is displayed at angle to make it appear to be in 3-D. You move your little triangle around on the grid, while attempting to avoid the little diamonds that are also moving around on the grid. Reaching the end of the grid teleports you back to the front of the grid.


- TECHNICAL -


Barrier ran on the Cinematronics hardware platform, which also ran such games as "Warrior", "Speed Freak", and "Star Hawk". It used a huge X-Y monitor that was almost entirely covered with a monitor bezel that only allowed the small triangular playfield to show through. Around 70 percent of the monitor's total area was hidden from the player. The monitor was too large for the cabinet, it actually poked out through a notch in the back door. The control panel featured a Start button and four directional buttons, even though this title would have been better with a 4-Way joystick. The sideart shows a picture of a blue wizard who has the playfield of the game as his body, and the same wizard is repeated on the monitor bezel that blocks out most of the screen. This game had a metal marquee that did not light up. The marquee graphics were also repeated directly below the control panel, just in case you didn't see them on top of the machine.

- TRIVIA -


Released in August 1979.


The 2nd programmer hired by Tim Skelly, Rob Patton, was only 17 when he joined Cinematronics. This game is very reminiscent of the old Mattel hand-held football games from the late 70's. The gameplay is not as deep, though :o). Vectorbeam didn't have a game to ship after "Speed Freak" and needed a product to sell so Cinematronics sold them "Barrier" and in the words of Tim Skelly, 'laughed our asses off about it'.

* Weaken Enemy Pitcher : To perform this trick, you need to get as close to the plate as you can. If the pitcher then hits you, tap Up twice on your joystick. Your hitter will then throw his bat to the floor, walk up to the mound and punch the pitcher, thus lowering his abilities. Using this tip will help mess up the pitching schedule for your opponent, and can lead to easy scoring opportunities off the tired pitchers.

=> [A] Shot, [B] Bomb


- TRIVIA -


Released in February 1993.


The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Distinguished'.


Licensed to Taito for world distribution and to Unite Trading for Korea.


This is the last shoot'em up and the first 'non-endless' game by Toaplan. A special version of Batsugun existed, originally it was only for the AOU show (Arcade Operators Union, an arcade game show held in Japan every year) and not for sale. After the Toaplan bankruptcy, the board started to appear on the second hand market.


Heralded by some as the first 'maniac shooter', Batsugun involved employees who would go on to form and work at Cave and continue to work in this subgenre. Batsugun saw an evolution in the use of complex bullet and enemy patterns and player fire power and hit-box.


The scoring trick on the fourth boss (destroy the two giant laser cannons, let the tanks appearing from the hangars fill the ramps and become red, bomb for 59,630 points a tank) was one source of inspiration for "Battle Garegga"'s gameplay.


Pony Canyon released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Batsugun - PCCB-00151) on 18/03/1994.


- UPDATES -


In the special version :

* Differents colours for all stages.

* Some sprites have different colors.

* The title screen/demo & the ship selection screen have different colors.

* The 4-lap end is different.

* The power-ups are different.

* The collision detection area is tighter than the original.

* The smart-bombs are bigger and nicer looking. They also do more dammage.

* You get 8 credits instead of 4 to complete the game.

So basically the 'Special ver.' is an easier version.

The actual licensing of the game went from Taito to Tecmo who further licensed the title to Romstar. This was a common distribution technique for games which were perceived as being 'second tier' or less when compared to 'hit' games. The game is still great fun and is, unfortunately, underappreciated.


While popular history seems to think that Data East designed the game (because the pinout matches Data East pinouts) the internals of the two 6809 processors appear to be a little more complicated than that. The design internally is rather Machivellian. It seems almost like it was created by a hardware designer who did not like software programmers!

Battlezone (c) 1980 Atari.


Atari's Battlezone is a 1-player game with an X-Y or vector-generation monitor. The game depicts a first-person view from inside a tank. The battles are fought in a large valley that is completely surrounded by mountains and volcanoes. The valley floor contains pyramids and boxes that can provide temporary protection for players (these cannot be destroyed by shots).


The enemy consists of slow and fast 'super' tanks and intelligent missiles - all of which become more evasive as the game progresses. In addition, flying saucers appear periodically. These don't shoot at players, but players can get very high point scores for shooting them.


The game starts with the slow tank visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of either type of tank or the missile by reading the messages in the upper left corner of the screen. For example, ENEMY TO RIGHT may be displayed. In addition, the sweeping radar display shows a dot for the enemy's location, accompanied by a sonar 'blip' sound.


The upper pie-shaped area on the radar represents the player's range of view on the screen below. If the enemy falls within this area, it will be shown on the screen below and will be accompanied by the message ENEMY IN RANGE.


Occasionally the flying saucer appears on the screen. It is a harmless observer to the battle and will not destroy the enemy or player. Its position is never shown on the radar, but players can earn points for shooting it down.  The saucer does act as a distraction, though, since it usually appears at the same time as the enemy tanks or missile. Saucers can be shot down by the player as well as enemy tanks.

- TRIVIA -


Battlezone went into the arcades in November 1980 and created such a sensation that the U.S. army ordered modified versions of the games to use in training.


Battlezone was the first environmental 3-D landscape game. The game used a system of bit-slice processors called a 'mathbox' to do 3-D calculations for the display. This kind of 'squeezing the most out of minimal hardware' mindset was what led Atari to create the innovative games it did in the 1980's. Approximately 15,020 units were produced.


As Battlezone was so innovative for its time, the US Army commissioned Atari to create a version of the game for infantry vehicle training (called "Bradley Trainer"). Ed Rotberg was assigned the project, but was very opposed to it. Major Dave Robinson and General Donn Starry of the U.S. Army were responsible for bringing Atari the idea of making a military version to be used in training.


* The Creation of Battlezone : The idea of a tank simulator was championed by Morgan Hoff, who became the project leader for Battlezone, while Ed Rotberg was the principal programmer. Ed Rotberg : "Morgan Hoff more or less championed it and decided to put together a team to implement the game. Given the technology that we had, the real challenge was how to make the game appear as if we had more technology than we did. And the question was always : How do we involve the player? Meeting those needs was where the artistry was involved in designing a game in those days.".

The developers used brilliant software code and innovative circuitry to create a high tech look. But some low-technology tricks were used as well. For example, a simple band of red cellophane was applied to the inside of the Battlezone screen. Placed across the top of the screen, the result was red colors for the radar and warning messages, even though Battlezone didn't have a two-color display. A game takes on a life of its own, Rotberg said : "Most games rarely turn out exactly the way that you plan them. Every time that you play the game, you try to amplify those things that are fun, and you try to pare away those things that are annoying and really not enjoyable. It is kind of like a story that grows in the telling.".


The volcano erupting in the background was created by Owen Rubin (Major Havoc). Rubin pestered Rotberg to add the volcano but he was too busy to write the code and told Rubin that if he wanted the erupting volcano he'd have to write the code. The next morning, Rotberg walked in to a volcano erupting onscreen and the code listing on his desk.


* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters : On the erupting volcano in the background of Battlezone, Ed Rotberg said : "One of the other programmers who was working on another project in the same lab kept saying, "Why don't you make the volcano active?" I had enough to do just to make the game play. And everyday he would say "You know, you really need to make that volcano active". He is really currently one of my very best friends, and he is a wonderful guy. But he kept pestering me about this. One day I said, "You're a programmer. If you want the volcano active, you write the code and I'll put it in". So I came in the next day and there was this chunk of code on my desk describing the motion of the rocks and such. I took an afternoon off and put the code into the program. That's how the volcano became active. It was never in the design.".


Atari engineers were always amazed by the abilities of the players out in the arcades. Morgan Hoff : "I remember a game that contained a succession of increasingly difficult mazes ranging from easy to difficult, to those requiring super human skill in timing. I was completely surprised to find players who could complete the most difficult levels. They were in a world of their own. They played the game with incredibly accurate hand and eye coordination and memory. One day I was in an arcade and... the best player was seven. He was extraordinary and he was standing on a chair to reach the controls.".


Although Atari engineers uniformly praised the best players out in the arcades, many of the engineers were awesome players themselves. Once two Atari engineers went on a skiing vacation in Utah and Dan Pliskin came back with the following story : "We were at Snowbird, and we had only been there a few days when we started to miss video games. So, we found a little arcade and my friend got onto a Missile Command (which was a pretty old game by then) and I got onto some pinball machine. We broke the high-score tables, and he had, like, 200 free cities and I had, like, 60 free games. When we got tired of playing, we just left them to these kids that were just wide-eyed, staring at us. The kids were standing there with their mouths open. They had never seen pinball wizards and video game masters.".


* Popular from the Start As Battlezone took shape, engineers in the lab wanted to play it, a lot. Ed Rotberg : "Usually when you have a winner you leave your lab for awhile and when you return there are people standing around playing your game, and that happens over and over again. You end up having to kick them off your machine to get any work done. That is your first indication that you have a winner. And I have never seen a really strong game that did not have that appeal. The guys in the labs are pretty good barometers". Another barometer, though after the fact, was to go into the arcades to watch others playing it. Rotberg continued : "The best feeling for a game designer is to go out into an arcade and see people having fun playing the game that they created. There is nothing better than that. To walk around and see all the other games, and know that people can choose from anything in there, but they are playing your game. That is pretty heavy stuff.".


David Palmer holds the official record for this game with 23,000,000 points on August 30, 1985.


A Battlezone unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Tron', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'The Philadelphia Experiment' and in the 1986 movie 'Running Scared' (the cab appears in Billy Crystal's apartment).


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battlezone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".


An upright Battlezone unit appears in the 38 Special music video 'Caught Up In You'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, you will be put into a surrealistic landscape. Almost immediately, an enemy will appear on the screen. You will know this by a warning sound the machine makes plus the enemy will show up on your radar. First of all, this game will be very different because you must look through a periscope apparatus. This is to give the feeling of being confined in a tank. Get used to limited movement of your head and use your eyes to quickly take in the entire battlefield in a glance.


* You must be able to identify different sounds in this game. Sounds you need to know are :

1) The warning that an enemy is on the battlefield.

2) The sound of an incoming missile.

3) The sound of a shot being fired (by you or at you).

4) The sound of the saucer.

5) The joyous sound of actually destroying something.

6) The sound when your tank bumps into an object (enemy unit or battlefield obstacle).


* Your field of vision is approximately 45 degrees. This means you will have to learn to use your radar effectively for anything out of your field of vision. The 45 degree wedge always faces forward (your line of site). Enemies (except the saucer) will show up on your radar as a white dot. Plus you will hear the beep as the radar sweep continues to cross over it.


* Be not only aware of where the enemies are, but also where the obstacles are also. There's nothing more frustrating then having the perfect shot lined up, or the perfect escape planned when you run into something. This is especially true when you are moving backwards.


* In order to line up with an enemy tank, you must turn your entire tank toward the enemy. The turret and tank are one piece versus being able to turn the turret independently of the tank.


* You can only have one shot out at a time. This can prove to be the difference between life and death since if you fire a stray shot, you must wait for that shot to disappear into the horizon before your tank is loaded again. This can take a couple of seconds. On the same note, the enemy tanks also work under this restriction. In other words, make sure you have your target lined up before taking a shot.


* The game starts out giving you the standard tanks. These tanks move slower then your tanks so they are pretty easy to kill. After the 30,000 point mark, however, the supertanks make their appearance.  These tanks are much quicker then your tank so you have to take them out quickly.


* Tank killing isn't actually too hard once you get the rhythm of how to do it down. There are a few methods for killing tanks :

1) When the tank first appears on your radar, turn around so that you are facing it. The enemy tank will of course take a shot at your tank.

2) Now, move backwards and turn slightly in the same direction of where the enemy tank is. In other words, if the enemy tank is slightly to your left, then go backwards while turning your own tank to the left. You may even see the enemy's tank shot appear in your field of vision. That means you have the right angle on the turn.

3) At the same time you are moving backwards, the enemy tank will be moving up to engage your tank.  Continue the above until the enemy tank is practically on top of your tank. Then rapidly turn left or right and hit him with a point-blank shot. Sometimes the enemy tank hits yours. Just like an obstacle, the enemy tank will back up and speed away. Turn rapidly to hit him before he can set up for a shot. Again, the Supertanks recover much quicker then the standard tanks.

4) This will work on both regular tanks and Supertanks. The difference is the fact that Supertanks close the distance much quicker then regular tanks.

5) Another way is to put an obstacle between yourself and the enemy tank. When an enemy tank hits an obstacle, they back up and move quickly away for a brief moment before they turn again to fire on your tank. If you are good, you can 'lead' the target when they are backing up or going forward and score a kill that way. Of course, this method is much more difficult.


* Don't attempt to outrun a Supertank. They can easily catch up to you. Plus, they like to get behind your tank to blast you from the rear. Nothing like not hearing the shot that destroys your tank.


* Another battlefield hazard is the missile. The first missile is dependent on the score setting. It is an easy one that comes straight for your tank. Just sit there and blow it apart. After that, though, things aren't as easy. As with the tanks, there is a method and certain rhythm to taking out missiles.

1) The missile will come down and take a hard turn to the right (as you are facing it). Then it will take a hard turn to the left. Then another hard turn to the right to hit your tank.

2) You can stay still and just turn your tank slightly. When the missile is turning to the left, fire ahead of it and you can destroy it.

3) Move backwards and turn toward your left. That way the missile will go across your field of vision before it makes its right turn again.

4) When the missile comes, move backward and take a ''blind'' shot. You may get lucky. Even if you don't, moving backwards will enable you to get another shot.

5) If you are really good, you can wait until it takes the last turn to the right toward your tank. Spin around and hit it like that. This is a very rough shot to execute.

6) If you mess up, sometimes you can move forward and to the right to cause the missile to miss. You also can usually cause a miss by putting tall (not the short ones you can shoot over) obstacles in your way.

7) Regardless of method, make sure there are not obstacles between you and the missile. The missile is capable of jumping all obstacles and it will also eliminate the missiles pattern. Nothing like a missile jumping

over an obstacle and landing on top of your tank.

8) For multiple missiles, you will have to adjust your direction so that when the next missile lands, it will be centered in your gunsight. You can also confirm this by using your radar.


* You will usually get a missile after about five tanks. Missiles usually come in twos or threes to make your life more exciting.


* Saucers are a great way to earn points. They are, unfortunately, on the battlefield when other enemies are present. If you have a safe, clear shot, then go for them. If not, you can still take a pot shot at them.

This is usually when you are spinning your tank around to deal with another enemy. If a saucer happens to be in the way, take a shot at it. You don't get points, however, if an enemy tank takes out a saucer.


* Another great thing about this game is that you will only have to deal with one enemy at a time. For example, if the missile appears, then the tank will disappear so you can concentrate on the missile.

This game is called 'Berabow Man' by Namco though this is likely a mistranslation as the later NEC PC-Engine port is called "Bravo Man". The name 'BERABOW' appears in the default high score list.


In Stage 8, the main character from "Pistol-Shogun - Pistol Daimyo no Bouken" (which was released 2 years later) must be fought.

The Berlin Wall (c) 01/1991 Kaneko.


The player takes control of a boy who must use his hammer to break the blocks that form part of the colourful, platform-strewn levels that form each stage. These holes act as traps for the many patrolling monsters and once an enemy has fallen into a hole, the player must then use the hammer on the enemy to make it fall through the hole and down to the platform below - causing it to change into fruit, which can then be collected. This game is a reworking of the 1980 classic, "Space Panic".

Berzerk (c) 1980 Stern Electronics.


The player controls the 'Humanoid' (colored green for player 1 and purple for player 2) and must negotiate a number of robot-filled rooms; each with up to as many as eleven, laser-firing enemy robots. The Humanoid can be killed either by a single shot from a robot, by running into a robot, by running into a wall of the maze, or by being touched by the player's nemesis, 'Evil Otto'.


To advance through the game, players must fight their way through each room to an opening at one of the far walls. Each robot destroyed is worth 50 points and while it's possible to progress without killing every robot in each room; destroying all of them will earn the player a per-maze bonus (worth ten points per robot). The game has an impressive 64,000 mazes, with each level designed to be more difficult than the last.


- TECHNICAL -


The Berzerk cabinet was the first in a series of cabinets from Stern that had a patented pull out drawer that allowed access to the games circuit boards from the front of the cabinet. This title features rather primitive painted side-art that only uses two colors, but it makes up for it with the awesome comic book style art on the control panel and monitor bezel. The marquee is only a 'Berzerk' logo, and it kind of looks like something that someone might have done in their high school airbrush class.


Berzerk is technically a monochrome game. It uses a special 'color overlay' circuit board to add color to the games graphics before they go to the monitor. A side effect of this is that walking very close to a wall will cause that section of the wall to change to your color.


Berzerk, in common with other machines commonly thought to have used samples (such as Atari's "Star Wars", "Paperboy" and "Gauntlet") used LPC encoded speech and a dedicated speech synthesizer.  So the speech is technically encoded data for this speech synth, rather than the now far simpler, digitized audio 'samples' for play back via a DAC.

- TRIVIA -


Released in October 1980.


Alan McNeil, an employee of Universal Research Laboratories (a division of Stern Electronics), had a dream one night involving a black-and-white video game in which he had to fight robots. This dream, with heavy borrowing from the BASIC game 'Robots' ('Daleks' in the UK), was the basis for Berzerk. The idea for a black-and-white game was abandoned when the color game "Defender" was released earlier the same year to significant success. At that point Stern decided to use a color overlay board for Berzerk. A quick conversion was made, and all but the earliest versions of the game shipped with a color CRT display. The game was test-marketed successfully at a Chicago singles bar before general release.


The title of the game comes from the series of books called 'The Berzerker Stories' by Fred Saberhagen. It's a novel about robots which go Berzerk and kill everybody.


Berzerk is the first robot killing game but the big selling point of Berzerk was speech.

From Tony Miller : "The speech was done using LPC coding that I believe was invented by T.I., although I remember we used a National Speech chip in it.  This was when speech and memory was expensive, so we didn't just digitize sounds and dump them out through a DAC. I remember it cost something like $1000 per word to have the compression done, so we tried to come up with a limited vocabulary which could be rearranged and reused as much as possible.There was some guy up in Silicon Gulch who did this stuff for a living - so it is possible to make money while talking in a monotone.".


The Artist Richard D. James, using his alter ego Caustic Window, has the sample : 'Humanoid must not escape' from this game in his song with the same name as the sample. It's from the album 'Caustic Window Compilation'.


Berzerk was also the first game to attempt a bit of on-screen comedy. Your robot opponents often fell foul of slapstick misfortune, shooting each other in the head or walking into walls and exploding in their attempts to kill you. And if you legged it out of a room without killing them all, the survivors would taunt you in their Speak & Spell voices : "Chicken! Fight like a robot!". Okay, it's not hilarious, but even Bob Monkhouse had to start somewhere. Sometimes when you escape as above, it will just utter "Chicken".


'Evil Otto' was named for 'Dave Otto', who worked for Dave Nutting's Arcade Engineering group as R & D director at the time Alan McNeil did. 'Evil Otto' can be considered one of the most intimidating video game villains of all time. He is, and even travels through walls, preventing a player from loafing in the room. He resembles a bouncing smiley face, and has been called a 'Malicious basketball' by some.


Berzerk was Stern's first major video game success. It was made in both upright (approx. 4000 units) and cocktail (approx. 100 units) models. Berzerk suffered a bit in sales due to frequent breakdowns of it's original giant sized optical 8-way joystick. Approximately 4200 orders were canceled by distributors and operators whose machines were frequently down from the opto-stick. Stern issued free WICO leaf switch sticks to operators after they had so much trouble with the optical stick, but this still hurt sales.


Berzerk shares a rather chilling distinction of being the first known game to be blamed for an actual player's death. In January 1981, Jeff Dailey was the first person to die playing a video game, a 19-year old Berzerk player, died of a massive heart attack right after playing his favorite game. His score was 16,660 (a very respectable score but disturbing for obvious reasons). On an equally distressing note, in October 1982 at the 'Friar Tuck Game Room' in Calumet City, Illinois : 18-year old Peter Burkowski, a physically healthy person who was alcohol-free and drug-free, inscribed his initials in Berzerk's top ten list twice in a matter of only 15 minutes. A few seconds after that, he collapsed and died of a heart attack.


Steve Wagner holds the official record for this game on the 'Fast Bullets' setting with 350,340 points on March 12, 2009.

Phil Younger holds the official record for this game on the 'Slow Bullets' setting with 304,570 points on August 12, 2007.


A Berzerk unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Tron' and in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.

A Berzerk unit appears in the ZZ Top music video 'Legs'.


Milton Bradley (MB) released a board game based on this video game (same name) in 1983. 'Can You Survive the Frenzied Attack of the Robot Army?' In this board game version, 2 players face off. One player controls the Humanoid and the other player controls Evil Otto and the robots. Players alternate sides for a maximum of three rounds or until both have been zapped three times and destroyed as the Humanoid. Humanoid lives are represented by chips placed in front of the player. Each time a player's Humanoid is zapped, the player surrenders one chip. Once a player loses all three chips, that player's Humanoid is destroyed, and therefore he/she cannot control the Humanoid for the rest of the game. The object of the game is to zap more robots while controlling the Humanoid than your opponent.


Berzerk inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Goin' Berzerk' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album, here are the full lyrics! :


Humanoid - This is you.  

You can move in eight directions.

Once you start you're never done.

You can go from room to room,

You can crawl or you can run.

You can wander through the maze.

It's a wonderland at night,

You can stop and aim your gun when,

there's a robot in your sights.


Robots - The various colored robots.

I think I'm going berzerk.

I think I'm losing my mind.

I'm getting lost in the shuffle.

It happens every time.

I think I'm going berzerk.

Would you like to come to?

I can't stop now - I'm addicted!

I'm berzerk over you.


Evil Otto - The bouncing smiley face.

If we fight this thing together

there's a chance that we might win.

Now here comes Evil Otto,

push the fire buttons in.

I'm sure he's crazy too because 

he's bouncing off the floor.

There's no way to destroy him , 

let him bounce right out the door.


The speech, 'Humanoid' and 'Intruder Alert!' featured heavily in 1988's seminal UK Acid track, 'Stakker Humanoid' by later Future Sound of London member Brian Dougans. His use of distortion and slightly lower pitch, leaves the game sounding quite tame by comparison...


- UPDATES -


2 different versions of the game were released. As a player's score increases, the colors of the enemy robots change, and the robots can have more bullets on the screen at the same time (once they reach the limit, they cannot fire again until one or more of their bullets detonates; the limit applies to the robots as a group, not as individuals). In the original version, the sequence goes :

* Yellow robots that don't fire

* Red robots that can fire one bullet

* Light blue robots that can fire two bullets

After 5,000 points Evil Otto doubles his speed, moving as fast as the player while robots remain in the maze, and twice as fast as the player after all the robots are destroyed.


The revised version, which had the much larger production run of the two, features a longer color sequence that also included green, purple, and white robots. In this version, the robot sequence went up to five normal speed bullets, then they began firing fast bullets, starting with one fast bullet, and eventually going as high as seven fast bullets at once. After 20,000 points the robots stay light blue and may have up to seven fast bullets on screen for the remainder of play. To balance the greatly increased threat from the robots in this version, Evil Otto's pursuit speed remains at its normal (half or equal the player's speed) level throughout.


- SCORING -


You get 50 points per robot destroyed. It doesn't matter whether you destroy them or they get destroyed some other way.


You get a bonus of 10 times the number of robots in a maze if you clear it For example, if you destroyed all 7 robots in a maze, then your bonus would be 10 X 7 or 70 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Here is how the rounds progress in the revised version : 

Points - Robot Color - Shots fired 

0-260 -Yellow - 0

260-1,200 - Red - 1

1,200-3,000 - Light Blue - 2

3,000-4,500 - Yellow / Green - 3

4,500-6,000 - Purple - 4

6,000-8,000 - Yellow - 5

8,000-10,000 - White - One fast shot (2x speed)

10,000-12,000 - Light Blue - Two fast shots


This color system now repeats. At around 20,000 points, the robots stay light blue. Starting at about 10,000 points. Berzerk becomes largely a game of luck. If you get an open maze with a lot of robots, there is not much you can do.


* When you start the game, the Humanoid will be put at the left entrance. (In a 2-player game, player 2's Humanoid will be put at the right entrance). You will face anywhere from 1 to 12 robots. Quickly assess where the Humanoid is at and destroy the closest robots. The first 3 sets of robots are pretty easy. It's when they start firing those 3+ shots at you or the supershots things can get bad.


* Remember, the Humanoid is longer then he is wide; use this to your advantage. Always try to exit the maze from the left or right exit so that the Humanoid presents a small profile for the next maze. If you enter from the top or bottom, you presents a bigger target. Of course, there is no defense against being put right next to a robot.


* There is a 1-2 second delay after you enter a maze before the robots come after you; use that to your advantage. 


* You cannot run and shoot at the same time in this game. You have to stop and shoot. Use the joystick to aim and press the FIRE button. The Humanoid may move a little in that direction so don't try to shoot robots point-blank or you will destroy the robot while the robot vaporizes you.


* When you get into the later rounds, luck will be as much a factor as skill. This is especially true when the robots are firing supershots at you (these shots travel twice the speed of normal shots). 


* Evil Otto (the bouncing happy face) will appear from where the Humanoid entered the maze. Evil Otto's appearance is directly related to how many robots you start with. The lower the number, the sooner Evil Otto appears. Evil Otto cannot be destroyed.


* Because the robots are attracted to you 'as the crow flies', they will tend to clump together and smash into each other. The best way to kill robots is to stand safely behind a wall and let them shoot and smash each other. The ball (Evil Otto) will also kill them. You can ignore some robots in the maze and let Otto kill them for you. Otto follows your position like the robots, so as he comes across the screen, lead him up and down into any remaining robots before you exit.


* If the robot cannot hit you with laser fire, they will still try to kill the Humanoid by attempting to run him over. 


* The walls in the maze are deadly. If the Humanoid or a robot runs into a wall, he is vaporized. (You score the points if a robot is destroyed by running into a wall). The wall will light up if the Humanoid is too close to it. 


* If you and a robot are in line and firing at each other, your shots will negate themselves out. In the later levels, this could prove deadly since they can keep up with your firepower. 


* An Interesting Quirk : There is a one pixel space between the Humanoid's head and shoulders. The game doesn't register it as existing so if a robot's shot goes through that space, the Humanoid doesn't die. 


* The robots always walk toward you unless you're in their line of fire; then they will pause to shoot. There are eight directions you and they can shoot. The only way to survive the higher levels (10, 000 points +) is to learn the blind spots of the robots. If you are in a robot's blind spot he poses no threat, and you can concentrate on blasting the others. The angle shots are almost never necessary. It is very difficult to hit a robot with an angle shot. When you shoot, the Humanoid stops moving, when you can't move, you are vulnerable. Make your shots count and don't bother wasting your time with angles unless you are on an early level and need the practice. 


* Because the robots are shorter than you, try to avoid robots at the bottom edge of the screen. By the time you move low enough to get a shot they will have already fired. In contrast, if you come 'up' on robots from the bottom, you can shoot their feet and duck back down before their shot reaches you. 


* Because the Humanoid is a lot taller than he is wide, it is very easy to avoid shots from above and below. Take out the robots to the sides of you first. 


* If you poke your head above a wall just far enough to shoot above it, the robots on the other side of it can't shoot you. They will only hit the wall. ALWAYS use this tactic to kill most of the robots in a maze. When you are in the right position, just hold down the fire button. This will make the Humanoid stand still. You can inch your way very close to the deadly walls without fear of running into them. When shooting up or down, that trick doesn't work. If there is a wall between you and a robot above you, run to the right and start shooting up just past the wall. If you are lucky, the robot will walk into your fire before he gets a shot off. By design, if a robot is above you, he will lock into position directly in-line with your shots, and you will shoot each other's bullets. In early rounds you can overpower a robot and outgun him, but later the robots can keep up with you and you will be in a deadlock. To defeat him, shoot up and immediately walk to the right and he will walk into your bullet. 


* The robots are programmed to avoid colliding into the sides of the deadly walls, but they can't detect the start or end of a wall. If a robot is below the end of a wall, you can move up and direct him into the wall end. 


* In later rounds, all of the real action takes place in the first two or three seconds of a round. If you survive the initial shots from the robots, you are as good as done with the maze. When a new maze comes on screen, you are very vulnerable. Often you are in the line of fire of five robots. As the new maze slides on-screen, you can see it before the robots appear. Use this time to decide which way to run. Assume that there will be a robot in each 'room' or 'nook'. Shoot the robot right in front of you first, and then run toward his position. By running ahead, you will exit the line of fire of any robots above/below you and also the dreaded angle shots. Once you are out of their line of fire, you can re-enter their line of fire selectively and shoot them. Get to a safe barrier as soon as possible and wait for the robots to move into easy positions.

Biomechanical Toy (c) 1995 Zeus.


A colourful and playable eightway scrolling platform game set in a world of animated toys; both good and evil. The magic pendulum that animates the toys has been stolen by the evil 'Scrubby', who was once banished from the kingdom and has returned to take revenge. Evil toys must be destroyed or avoided, while good toys will offer help the the game's hero, Inguz, in his quest to regain the pendulum.


Inguz carries a basic, single-firing gun, although additional ammo clips can be found throughout the game that upgrade the gun with either extra shot power, automatic fire or exploding bullets. When the gun's current ammo clip is empty, Inguz will take a moment to reload. Bombs can also be found and used to attack all enemy toys on screen. Inguz begins each stage and life with a full health meter of eighty units, but food can be found that will boost the health meter. The player can lose a life either by running out of health, falling off the bottom of the screen, or running out of time. Clearing each stage awards bonus points based on both remaining time and health units.


Checkpoints, indicated by red flags, are located at certain points throughout the stages. In the event of losing a life, the player will restart at the last checkpoint reached. Objects with Inguz's face on them (such as wooden chests and balloons) release bonus items when shot. An abstract, oriental-looking face occasionally forms part of a level's platform which, when shot, will release balloons which can in turn be shot for bonus items. A giant flying hat also turns up and will drop bonus items when shot.

Round 8 : NONE


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Bosses strategy :

STONE BLOCK - Vitality :  2 or 4. After completion of Round 1, you will see two blocks stacked up. After the completion of Round 2, you will see four blocks stacked up.

1) The blocks will attack in a staggered formation. In a sense, it will look like they are walking toward your character.

2) When they are in the air, they will attempt to land on your character. It's best to either move back or jump forward. Don't let yourself get caught in the corner.

3) As you hit them, cracks will appear in them. This means that your hits are connecting. Again, don't stay in one place too long or they will jump onto your character.

4) Use the same type of tactics for both the two and four block bosses. Just move under them when they jump and take shots when you can. This will be especially important on the four block round.

5) Just keep moving around and hitting them and you shouldn't have any problems of turning these blocks back to dust.


DRAGONS (ALL COLORS) - Vitality : 3, 6, or 8. You get the Blue Dragon on Round 3, Red Dragon on Round 6, and the Black Dragon on Round 8.

1) These are by far the roughest bosses you will have to deal with. They fly and breathe fire which makes maneuvering a bit tricky. In addition, you must hit them in the top part of their body.

2) When the battle sets up, the dragon will be on the right side of the screen, wings folded up. When you approach, the dragon will take off and fly up and to the left. If you can, jump and shoot at the moment of takeoff to get in a hit.

3) The dragon will flash when you successfully connect a shot. The number of hits to make the vitality meter go down will depend on the weapon you have.

4) When the dragon flies toward your character, it will use its breath weapon to torch the floor in front of it. Jump to the opposite side the dragon is flying toward.

5) You can't hit the dragon high in the air. The dragon will come back down and go under your character. This is a great time to get in as many shots as possible. Again, watch out for the breath weapon.

6) If you get too close, the dragon will claw and bite at your character. Again, keep your distance since this would be suicide going toe-to-toe with the dragon.

7) Continue to move/jump around the room and you will eventually send the dragon back to where it belongs.


DEMOM WARRIOR (ALL COLORS) - Vitality : 5 or 6. You get the Blue Demon Warrior on Round 5 and the Red one on Round 7.

1) When you approach the Demon Warrior, it will unfurl its wings and display two nasty looking swords in each hand.  In addition, the Demon Warrior has limited flight/jump capabilities.

2) Since the Demon Warrior stays on the ground, you can jump and attack as long as you keep your distance. The Demon Warrior has two major attacks :

a) It will hit its swords onto the ground creating a wave of fire or ice which can knock some chunks out of your armor.

b) It will jump close to your character and use its swords to deadly effect.

3) For both of these attacks, you can leap higher then the Demon Warrior so when it gets too close, jump over it and attack from the other direction. Also, use the raised platforms to further home your attacks in.

4) Continue to jump back and forth. Watch out for residual fire or ice before you jump to a spot. When all is clear, go to it to pound on the Demon Warrior some more.

5) Keep up this pattern to send him packing.


DEVIL - Vitality : 3. You only encounter this boss on Round 4.

1) This little flying menace packs a major wallop. Its main attack is flight and throwing purple fire at your character.

2) You will either need a weapon that can shoot in the air or find platforms/ledges to stand on to fire on this boss since it rarely comes down to ground level.

3) Use the jump button liberally on this round. You will not only need to jump out of the way of the flames the devil throws, but you will also need to keep sharp for any attacks you can get in.

4) The Devil tends to swoop in and make an attack before you can react and counterattack.

5) This boss will require patience and a lot of maneuvering room so you don't get yourself cornered. Fortunately, it doesn't take that many hits (even with a weak weapon) to bring this boss down.


* Walkthrough : You will start the game at Round 1 (unless you are continuing). You will be given 200 Zenny, two-hit armor, and a basic weapon. In addition, each round is timed so you will not only have to beat your enemies, you will also have to beat the clock. You will have 1:59 to complete each round. If you fail, then you lose a man and the clock resets again. All dungeons exit at the same exact point you entered them from. There are also secrets buried in the walls. Some give money, others give weapon or armor bonuses.

6) Go up to the next platform and talk to the sage for 100 Zenny. Then go up and follow the steps to the right.

7) Continue to follow the path around until you get to another sage who gives you 100 Zenny. Continue on the path and you will come to a sage operating a shop.

8) As you continue to follow the path, you will encounter two more sages. One gives you a minute of time.  SECRET : Break the wall for Armor +1.

9) The other sage, farther down the path, will give you 200 Zenny.

10) At the end of the path is the third boss.


ROUND 4 :

1) There is a sage operating a shop to your left. Again, after shopping, head across the bridge to the right. Go up to the next platform on the right for another sage and a shop.

8) Continue on the path for the fourth boss.


ROUND 5 : 

1) Again, another sage to the left, another shop. Then head right.

10) The next platform has a sage waiting to give you a Potion of Vitality.

11) Follow the path to the right and before the sixth boss battle, a sage with a shop waits to serve your needs.


ROUND 7 :

1) One of the harder rounds since you will have to go back and forth a few times. Plus the jumps can be a real pain.

2) Go shopping on your left then head right. You will be jumping to several platforms across big pits with spikes. When you get all the way to the right, climb the column. SECRET : Break wall for Weapon +1.

9) Jump the gap and you will have a close encounter with the seventh boss.

Black Widow (c) 1982 Atari.


In Black Widow you have to move around a web using two joysticks to control the action. The left joystick moves, while the right joystick fires. "Robotron - 2084" players will feel right at home playing this game, as the controls are identical. You have to defend your little vector spider around her vector web in order to keep out all the deadly bugs. Shoot down bugs and they turn into bonuses. Watch out for eggs, if you see any eggs, then you should quickly push them off the web before they hatch. Other enemies include mosquitos, beetles, and hornets.

- TRIVIA -


Released in December 1982.


James Vollandt holds the official record for this game with 930,100 points on May 1, 1984.


Approximately 1,550 units were produced. All Black Widow games were conversions of other Atari vector titles and were sold $995. Even the brand new ones were actually "Gravitar" games that Atari converted at the factory. In general this title shared a lot of common components with "Gravitar" and "Space Duel", and Black Widow machines are often used to repair those titles.


- SCORING -


Mosquito - If shot, becomes '$'.

Beetle - Eats '$', but if shot, becomes '$'.

Hornet - Lays an egg on '$', but if shot, becomes '$'.

Egg - Grows to become hornet or spoiler. Must be pushed off the web to score 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, or even 2500 points.

Grub Steak - Tag for 500, 250, 100, or 50 points -- the sooner the better.

Spoiler - Invulnerable. Can only be destroyed by a grenade bug, bug slayer or rocket bug.

Grenade Bug - Explodes if shot. Bugs and eggs within the kill zone score 500 points each.

Rocket Bug - Invulnerable. Launches "rockettes" at black widow from the other bugs it tags. Shoot rockettes to score 100 points each.

Thunderbug - If shot, it breaks formation and attacks. If shot again, it explodes all other T-bugs for 5000 points. Keep away from all T-bugs to earn 10000 points. The resulting chain reaction from multiple thunderbugs is very dangerous and can encompass over 80% of the level at some times, depending on how many T-bugs are involved.

Bug Slayer - Harmless to the player and invulnerable. The Bug Slayer competes with the Black Widow for food. Beat it to its flashing prey for points

Blaster [DuraMold model] (c) 1983 Williams.


The player takes control of a spaceship and must fight against wave after wave of enemy fighters, while trying to rescue the stranded astronauts that represent the last surviving remnants of the human race. Enemies attack the player both with weapons, and by making 'suicide runs' at the player's ship. The game consists of 11 different levels, 9 of which are repeated, bringing the total number of levels to 20.


The levels are : Planetoid Waves, Robot Grid Waves, Saucerland Waves, Vampire Waves, Time Tunnel Waves, Outer Space Waves, Enduro Waves, Cat World Waves, and Mastermind Waves (there are 2 of each of these).


There are also 2 unique waves that occur only once, they are Armageddon and Paradise.


Players can select their starting wave at the start of the game; choosing from Planetoids, Robot Grid, Saucerland, and Vampires. During the game, players must be careful to NOT shoot the human astronauts that drift through the levels. These must be rescued by 'running' into them.


Despite the presence of an energy meter, the player can take exactly three hits before he or she dies. Upon death, the window of the player's virtual cockpit breaks and one of the player's lives is lost. Blaster has a 'Continue' option but this can only be used once.


- TECHNICAL -


The DuraMold modelwas a large circular arcade cabinet made entirely out of thick plastic. These cabs were very attractive and almost impossible to damage. They were, however, expensive to produce and had a fatal design flaw : they shrank slightly in the first few months after they were made. In some cases the shrinking machine would eject its monitor, and send it flying across the room. Williams quickly developed a fix for this, but no one wanted DuraMolds after hearing about them shooting monitors across arcades. The DuraMold Blaster was all black and had yellow graphics on the control panel and marquee.

Released in November 1983.


Also released as "Blaster [Upright model]" and as a Cockpit model.


Blaster was the official sequel to "Robotron - 2084", its attract mode went : The Robotrons have destroyed the last human family.


Dwayne Richard holds the record for this game with 92,346,500(!) points.


Originally known as 'Master Blaster', but they changed the name to avoid confusion with a pinball simulator called 'Bill Budges Raster Blaster' for the Apple computer. The 3-D effects of this game were all hand rendered which required thousands of hours of design work. Due to the expense of the pseudo-3D generating hardware, Blaster was released in very limited numbers.


When Blaster was first put out at a test location in late 1983, it had 30 waves and allowed you to continue a game by spending another credit. By the time the game went into production in early 1984, the program had been modified to have 20 waves, and no buy-ins allowed.


- UPDATES -


The very rare 30-wave version has more enemies and more diabolical levels.

Blasteroids (c) 1987 Atari Games.


A one or two-player update of Atari's seminal "Asteroids", where the object of the game is to clear all sectors of the asteroids and enemy ships. Once this task is completed, the player goes on to battle Mukor - the "boss" asteroid who rules all galaxies - and destroy him.


The player's ship appears first in the center of four vortices, he or she must chose which vortex they wish to enter, which then transports them to a sector of their chosen star system.


Unlike Asteroids, the player ship has a finite amount of fuel which must be replenished as often as possible. This is achieved by destroying specifically-colored asteroids which turn into collectible crystals. Not all sectors contain the crystal-bearing asteroids, however, and if the player runs out of fuel, a ship is lost. The game contains three different ship configurations and the player can switch between them at any time during a level. The three configurations are : Speeder (small and fast, but weak), Fighter (medium speed and strength) and Warrior (large and strong but very slow). 


Additional power-ups can be collected to improve the player's chances, some of the items available are : additional guns, larger fuel tanks, crystal magnets and impervious shields. Some of these add-ons are time-limited while others last until the player's current ship is destroyed. In the asteroid field, there are also 'popcorn' asteroids; small blue rock formations that grow larger and travel faster with each hit they take until they become large, non-moving objects on the screen. These obstacles must be avoided since hitting them will drain all of the ship's fuel, costing the player a life. A popcorn asteroid can not be destroyed. Hitting anything other than bonus power-ups and energy crystals costs precious fuel. Clearing a sector of all of its asteroids takes the player back to a screen and shows a preview of all of the cleared and uncleared sectors in this star system. Some sectors are marked as "unknown" and no preview is offered for these levels. From here, the player can choose which system they wish to tackle next. All systems need to be cleared before the player is given the chance to battle against Mukor himself. To kill Mukor, the player must eliminate each of the volcanoes with multiple blaster hits. Destroying a volcano causes Mukor to release bonus power-up items, and destroying all of the volcanoes causes Mukor to flee, returning the player to the selection vortices.


Later, after all other sectors have been cleared, the player will eventually have to face Mukor again and this time, the enemy boss will have to be destroyed. After Mukor has been destroyed, the game ends.


In the simultaneous two-player game, the first person to fly their ship into a vortex chooses the star system to which the players go. A unique feature of two-person play is the docking of ships : to dock, one player must transform their ship to the largest size while the other transforms to the smallest. By touching the two ships together, they dock and form one large ship. The player originally with the larger ship now controls the speed and direction of the docked ship and can fire straight forward. The player with the smaller ship controls a turret that can rotate and fire independently of the main ship. The dock is broken when the player with the small ship hits their 'thrust' button.

The game was originally to have areas in which a certain ship form was required to get through them, but the game's production was pushed forward, and it didn't receive the fine-tuning that was originally planned.


Background space-scapes, pictures of space ships, asteroids and other obstacles are actually digitized pictures of real-life objects. The asteroids were digitized by non other than ILM (Industrial Light and Magic), Lucasart's industry-leading special effects company.


Mark Twitty holds the official record for this game with 2,773,840 points on April 20, 1988.

Block Out (c) 1989 Technos Japan Corp.


Block Out is a 1-player or a simultaneous 2 players competitive game of unique dimensional action and strategy.

As the blocks drop one-by-one into the three-dimensional pit, rotate them by using the three buttons and joystick. Once the player has decided on the the rotation of the block, use the button to drop the block into place. The objective is to place the blocks into the pit without leaving any empty spaces. Once this is achieved, the layers without empty spaces, will disappear.


The player begins the game by selecting a starting stage. Game start level select can be chosen from stages 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20. There is a total of 100 stages in the game and as the players progress through the game, the stages get more and more difficult.

Each stage has a certain number of layers (faces) that must be erased. Once these faces are erased, the player will move on to the next stage. The less blocks the players has left in the pit at the end of the stage, the more points are awarded.


In addition to the one player mode, Block Out offers a competitive simultaneous two player mode. The split screen effect gives each player their own pit with which to play in. They compete against each other in the race to erase the faces. As one player erases a face, that face will be added to the opponent's pit, making their pit rise. This allows less room to work. There are two ways to win in the 2-player mode :

1) Force the opponent to the top of their pit and out of the game

or

2) Erase 21 faces first.

Blockade (c) 10/1976 Gremlin.


This game was two player only, you must have a live human opponent to play against, or else the other players character will go straight into a wall, making for a very quick and boring game. Each player moves their character around leaving a solid line behind them. All moves are made on an invisible grid, so you can only turn at 90 degree angles. To win you must last longer than your opponent before hitting something (first person to hit something loses). The game ended after one player chalked up six wins, but this was operator adjustable down to as low as three.


- TECHNICAL -


This game came in an upright dedicated cabinet. The machine was decorated with only a marquee, which showed the game title. It did not have any other graphics or sideart. The sides were of a dark woodgrain, which probably went nicely in the average pool hall or bowling alley (where most early games were located). The game featured a control panel that was devoid of joysticks, instead you controlled the game using a button for each direction.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Here's A Way To Play Blood Bros. For As Long As You Want :

1) Get to the second screen (preferably without dying on the first screen).

2) Shoot the building on the right side of the screen and start shooting the trees in the background on the right. 20,000 points fly out from each bunch of trees. Continue.

3) That is basically it. A few problems occur and here is how to counter them :

3a) 5 men run across the back from the left and throw grenades : Just shoot the grenades before they get to you. Eventually they come out less often, and will stop altogether.

3b) The men on the right come out from the edge to shoot you : Same as above. They stop eventually.

3c) A plane flies over and drops bombs : Same as above. It stops after some time.

3d) After a certain amount of time a bird comes out to kill you : Let it. Only 2 birds ever come out (sometimes only 1) and then they also stop coming. This is why it pays not to die on the first screen.

4) Hold your finger on the button to keep shooting the trees (sticky-tape works well here) and prepare to get 'really' bored. Play the neighboring game so that you can keep an eye on it.


* Extra Live : On the 1-1 and 4-1 stages, the tin can be shot eight times to give you a free man. If you miss it, don't bother trying again - you only get one chance.

Dropping a bomb in the monster pit : 50 points.

Returning a monster to the monster pit : 100 points.

Finding a piece of the blueprint in the maze : 1,000 points.

Killing the monster with the constructed weapon : 500, 1,000, 1,500 or 2,000 points, depending on how close the monster is to the girl.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Use your speedup ability to negotiate the maze faster, but save some of your energy in case you collect a bomb. You do not have enough time to dispose of a bomb running at normal speed.


* If a monster is sitting on the weapon start button, only return it to the monster pit when it is convenient to you, as the monster does no harm except drop the pieces of the weapon to the floor. Once the monster is removed the pieces are easy to replace on the blueprint.


* There is never more than one piece of the blueprint in a house, so do not return if you have already collected a weapon piece. There will only be a bomb located there.


* The firing pattern of the weapon is random, and only a few shots will actually reach the top of the screen. It will therefore be mainly luck when you kill the monster.

Released in June 1979.


Upon joining Namco, Mr. Iwatani wanted to design pinball games. Gee Bee, Cutie Q and Bomb Bee were his early video game/pinball hybrids. Toru Iwatani would achieve later, greater fame by designing "Pac-Man".


- SCORING -


Pop Bumpers : 10 or 100 points

Spinner : 10 or 100 points

Green Drops : 10 points

Blue drops : 20, 40, 60 or 80 points

1st row of drops : 10 points

NAMCO lights : 50 points

Big Pop : 1,000 points


Adjustments to scoring :

Finishing red-yellow side drop targets bank puts in barrier to the side drain and increases the pop bumper points on the side cleared.

Finishing blue top drop targets gives you a big 1,000 pop bumper which you have a limited number of hits you can give it before it explodes and gets replaced by another bank of blue drop targets.

Lighting all NAMCO lights increases bonus multiplier to 2X.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Occasionally the ball will get stuck in a very long loop (this usually happens with the pop bumpers). Just sit back and relax while the points rack up, but eventually the game will figure out the ball is stuck and shoot it out in some other direction.

Bomb Jack (c) 1984 Tehkan.


A Superbly playable and addicitive platform game, with gameplay that gives more than a passing nod to Namco's seminal "Pac-Man".


The object of the game is to collect all of the bombs on each level, before progressing to the next. Extra point bonuses are awarded for collecting bombs with their fuses lit. Only one bomb at a time has a lit fuse, and collecting twenty or more of these lit bombs on any given level will earn the player a points bonus (see TIPS AND TRICKS for details). Bomb Jack is pursued around each level by a variety of constantly spawning, mechanical enemies. When Bomb Jack gets killed, he drops to the nearest platform, always landing on his head.


The 5 different background pictures that feature in the game are : the Sphinx in Egypt, the Akropolis in Greece, Castle Neuschwanstein in Bavaria, skyscrapers and a cityscape by night. While the 5 backgrounds themselves are repeated as the player progresses, the platform layouts for each level are completely different. At least until level 18, after which the levels repeat themselves.


A powerball appears at semi-regular intervals and moves diagonally around the screen. If the player manages to grab this, all of the level's monsters are frozen for several seconds and can then be killed by having Bomb Jack fly into them (similar to the 'Powerpill' feature in "Pac-Man"). Collecting the Bonus 'B' symbols will increase the amount of points awarded for collecting bombs with their fuses lit. Picking up an 'Extra' symbol awards the player with an additional life, while catching the 'Special' symbol will give the player an extra credit.

- TRIVIA -


Released in October 1984.


The original idea for Bomb Jack was conceived by Michitaka Tsuruta, lead designer for Guzzler and Solomon's Key, under the supervision of Kazutoshi Ueda, the genius behind Mr. Do, Lady Bug and other Universal coin-ops.


Curiously enough, the infamous Sphinx in the opening round was not rendered by the graphic designer of the game, but by Ekiko, the sound designer. Tsuruta-san recalls how roles in Japanese development teams were quite interchangeable, in those early years.


Round 1 music is the ending song from the Japanese animated cartoon series 'Spoon Oba-san', sung by the ultra-popular Mari Ijima (Lynn Minmay's voice in Macross). The anime was aired in 1983... at that time, Bomb Jack development was just starting : something more than a coincidence, then.

Round 2 features the music of 'Lady Madonna', by The Beatles. Tsuruta-san,  recalls that rights were paid for the licensed music at the time; still, later ports (PS2 and Xbox) come with a replaced soundtrack (mostly the Vs. Mighty Bomb Jack score).


"Bomb Jack II" has nothing really to do with Tekhan or Tecmo : it was developed by british Elite Systems for European home computers only, in an attempt to follow the huge success of the Bomb Jack coin-op conversion. They basically bought the license for the name, and then proceeded to create a mediocre maze game.


Giauco Bondavalli holds the official record for this game with 20,010,960 points on November 3, 1984.


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Tecmo Game Music - 28XA-95) on 25/09/1986.


- UPDATES -


The older version (set 2) says 'YOU ARE LUCY' instead of 'YOU ARE LUCKY'.


- SCORING -


Jumping, hitting a wall or falling from a platform : 10 points x bonus multiplier value.

Normal bomb : 100 points x bonus multiplier value.

Firebomb : 200 points x bonus multiplier value.


(P) Power : 100 when blue, 200 when red, 300 when purple, 500 when green, 800 when cyan, 1,200 when yellow and 2,000 points when grey x bonus multiplier value.


(B) Bonus Multiplier: 1,000 points x bonus multiplier value.

(E) Extra Life : 1,000 points x bonus multiplier value plus an extra life.

(S) Special : 1,000 points x bonus multiplier value plus a free credit.


Killing monsters while (P) is active : 100, 200, 300, 500, 800, 1,200 and 2,000 points. These are all multiplied by the current bonus multiplier value.


End of level bonus :

23 firebombs defused : 50,000 points.

22 firebombs : 30,000 points.

21 firebombs : 20,000 points.

20 firebombs : 10,000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* A little information about the appearence of the powerball : the rule is very simple and you just have to look at the colour at the left and right of the multiplicator number, its size grows as you collect bombs.


1) Take a 'lit bomb' and you get 1 point ahead for the next Powerball. Take a non-lit bomb and you'll get 0.5 point for the next Powerball. When you achieve 10 points, the powerball appears. Your powerball points don't grow if either the powerball is there or if the 'power music' is playing, so avoid collecting bombs when it's not necessary.


2) The powerball can have different score values when taking it. When it appears, jump or hit a wall and its colour will change. The colours and score values are blue (100 points), red (200 points), purple (300 points), green (500 points), turquoize (800 points), yellow (1000 points) and grey (2000 points).


3) The 'B' bonus coin adds 1 to the multiplicator value and appears each 5,000 points, but only if you 'pass' these 5,000 points when not taking a 'B' coin. For example, your multiplicator is 2x, your score is 9,000 and you take a 'B' coin; giving you 1,000x2 = 2,000 points which makes a total of 11,000 points. A 'B' coin should then appear because you have passed the 10,000 points, but doesn't because you took a 'B' coin to achieve this score so you'll have to wait for 15,000 points to get a new 'B' coin. The multiplicator limit is X5.


* An important piece of information to remember is that you can pick up the bombs in a certain order to earn maximum points. If you pick up most of the bombs while their fuses are lit, you get the following bonuses :

20 - 10,000 pts.

21 - 20,000 pts.

22 - 30,000 pts.

23 - 50,000 pts.

So of course, you'll want to try to get 23 each time (This is of course, VERY difficult!). The P (Power) coin appears after every ninth bomb is collected. The points value of the P coin ranges from 100 (Blue) to 2,000 (Silver). Since the color changes each time BJ jumps, you can control the bonus level by making small jumps until the coin turns silver.


* The B (Bonus) coin appears every 5,000 points, and advances the bonus multiplier by 1. There is a maximum of 5 B coins per level.


* Picking up the S (Special) coin awards one free credit. It will also take you to the next level automatically.


* You can control where the mechanical bird appears by holding the joystick in the opposite direction. Example : Hold the joystick to the Right as soon as the round starts and the mechanical bird appears on the left of the screen. If the stick is held diagonally, the bird appears in the opposite corner.


* When you start a level, and directly go to left or right, bird(s) will appear on the other side : it's usefull to put them where you want in order to make this level easyer, levels 7, 8 & 9 are good examples for that.

Boot Camp (c) 08/1987 Konami.


A one or two player multi-event combat game, similar in gameplay style to Konami's "Track and Field" series.

* In the obstacle course, you must repeatedly press the fire button to run as fast as possible. Press the jump button in order to clear or mount hurdles of various hights. Complete the course within a specific ammount of time to continue the game.

* In the Iron Man race, the controls are the same but you will jump puddles and boulders and swim across a stream. 

* In the firing ranges, aim with the joystick or trackball and shoot using the fire button. There will be various firing range sessions beginning with stationary targets, preceeding to moving targets, and finishing with to having to avoid hitting the targets that represent comrades. The comrade targets resemble your drill instructer but you must still avoid hitting them (the wrong targets and the drill instructers) as it will cost you the game. The activities get progressively more difficult as you proceed.

Boot Hill (c) 1977 Midway.


A classic 1 or 2-player western gunfight game, featuring a monochrome display overlaid via mirror onto back-lit plastic background. Each player uses a small joystick to move their cowboy up and down the play area, while a second, much larger joystick is used to aim the pistol and shoot - this larger stick also has a trigger button. The game's single goal is simply to shoot the other player, who is situated on the opposite side of the game area. Wagons and cacti litter the middle of the play area, providing temporary cover from the opponent's gunfire (while, of course, providing the opponent with cover from the PLAYER'S shots). These obstacles slowly disintegrate as they are shot; much like the shields in Taito's "Space Invaders".


Boot Hill is time-based NOT life based, with the factory default set at ninety seconds. This is, of course, operator adjustable via the dip settings. The computer opponent is quite easy to beat with a little practice, but a human opponent provides a much stronger challenge.


- TECHNICAL -


This game was released in an upright dedicated cabinet, mostly yellow, but it was covered with stencil style painted cowboy sideart that showed two different cowboys on each side. The front of the machine had a few more cowboys painted on it (one with a black hat and one with a white hat). There was no marquee at all, the game had its title printed on the monitor bezel, which also showed a detailed cartoon scene of a few cowboys shooting it out in a graveyard on top of a hill. The game used a 23'' monochrome open frame monitor that was buried deep within the machine.

- TRIVIA -


Released in March 1977.


On the surface, Boot Hill seemed to represent quite a leap forward in technological terms. The highly detailed and colourful backdrop was very striking for the time. It was, of course, achieved with something far simpler than a technological leap forward; the wholly unscientific method of having a drawn, printed backdrop over which the in-game monochrome graphics were projected, via a large mirror.


This game was one of several early video and non-video arcade games to feature, albeit briefly, in George Romero's horror movie classic 'Dawn of the Dead' (1977) - the sequel to 1968's 'Night of the Living Dead'. The scene, occurring roughly halfway through the film, features four survivors of a zombie holocaust who are seeking refuge from hordes of the walking dead in a giant shopping mall; which, of course, just happens to have an arcade. The version of Boot Hill played in the movie seems to be without the backdrop.

Bosconian - Star Destroyer (c) 1981 Namco.


A space shooter where the player must destroy several enemy bases on each round while evading enemy ships, asteroids and mines. Enemy bases are destroyed either with a shot to the center or by shooting out all 6 base cannons. The player's ship is always positioned in the center of the screen with everything else scrolling around it as the player flies. A radar map to the right shows the position of the player, enemy bases, and occasional formation attack groups.

- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1981.


Bosconian was famous for being the first game to have a continue feature. When the game was released, Midway gave out strategy booklets to the game from a display attached to the machine.


There are 5 versions of this arcade game that were made. Namco made 3 and Midway made 2 of them (US manufacture and distribution (02/1982)). They are all the same except the new Namco version (see 'Updates' section for more information).


In the game Ridge Racer, a car has this game as a sponsor. It is a white and red car named RT Bosconian. Its sister car, from another Namco game is a white and blue car named RT Nebulasray. They were used in Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer 2, Ridge Racer 64, and Ridge Racer DS.


The origin of the keywords in Bosconian (as in the 'Zwilniks of Boskone') is the Lensman space-opera saga, which in Japan always enjoyed high popularity.

Bosconian - Boskonian

I-Type missile - Eich

P-Type missile - Ploor

E-Type misslle - Eddore


Ken McLeod holds the official record for this game with 2,913,150 points on February 24, 1983.


- UPDATES -


In the NEW Namco version, the Enemy Base setup is different. Both versions have the same Enemy Base setups, but they are in different order as the rounds go up. This is also true regarding where your fighter starts at. For example, the setup for Round 4 on the other versions is the same as the setup for Round 6 on the new Namco.


- SCORING -


Asteroid : 10 points

Cosmo Mine : 20 points

I-Type Missile (Looks like fighter) : 50 points

P-Type Missile (Looks like boomerang) : 60 points

E-Type Missile (Looks like Enemy Base Missile) : 70 points

Spy Ship (announced by synthesized voice stating 'Spy Ship Sighted') : 200 or 400 points

Enemy Station Cannon : 200 points

Enemy Station : 1500 points

Enemy Formation : 500, 1000 or 1500 points depending on missile type

Control Fighter in Formation (The off-colored fighter) : 100, 120 or 140 points (twice the normal missile value)


Bonus for no-miss clear (completing a round without dying) - this bonus is given only when the game is set to auto difficulty : multiplier x number of bases, the multiplier starts at 100 points and increases by 100 points each time you get the bonus up to 1000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Easter Egg :

1) Enter service mode.

2) Keep B1 pressed and enter the following sequence : Up(x5), Right(x6), Down, Left(x4). '(c) 1981 NAMCO LTD.' will be added at the bottom of the screen.


* The action starts immediately as soon as you start your game. Your fighter will be put on the screen.  Your radar display will show how many space stations need to be taken out. The radar doesn't show, though, all the space debris all over the place and the enemy fighters (unless they are in formation). Your fighter stays in the middle of the screen.


* Be aware that the enemy missiles are faster then your ship. This means you will have to learn to use the joystick proficiently so that you can maneuver away from these enemy missiles attempting to commit suicide on your ship.


* At the beginning of the round, quickly look at your radar to determine where the Enemy Stations are. Then quickly figure out a systematic way of destroying them since time is one's enemy in this game. Just because they are lined up in a row doesn't mean that the missile bays are facing the same direction.


* By that same token, your ship fires lasers from both the front and back. This means if anything is trying to 'sneak' up on you, they won't stand a chance.


* Use the space debris to your advantage. You score points regardless of whether you hit the enemy, or if you use other means to assist, such as the mines or rocks.  Just keep in mind that the space debris doesn't return until the next round.


* The Enemy Stations can be destroyed two ways :

1) The first way is to fire a shot directly into their missile bay. This is easy to do on the first two rounds.  By round three, the missile bay has a door which opens and closes to make it more of a challenge. After round three, the station will fire a missile if your fighter is in the missiles path. You can easily destroy this missile with your ship.

2) The other way is to destroy all six cannons around the space station. This method also enables you to get more points in the long run. To do this, though, means you will have to deal with more enemy missiles since you have to constantly loop around to hit the cannons. In addition, the pods fire back on your ship.


* Enemy Stations can be oriented with the missile bay facing left/right or up/down. Keep this in mind if you are taking on multiple stations in one area. While you are pounding on one Enemy Station, three more may be firing at your ship to prevent you from destroying your target.


* The warning conditions tell you how safe it is for the moment :

1) GREEN means no enemies within view.

2) YELLOW means enemies present.

3) RED means that you have taken too long and the enemy is now moving twice as fast to ram you.

4) You will also hear synthesized voice prompts stating either 'Alert, Alert' or 'Condition Red' regarding these conditions.


* At regular intervals, a formation of enemy missiles will head toward your ship. You can see what the formation of these enemy missiles are in by looking at the area above the top, left corner of the radar. This will show you if they are in a line, checkerboard pattern, etc. You will also see this formation (represented by a red dot) on your radar screen. Some quick tips for tangling with formations :

1) Enemy formations always appear as a control missile with four missiles.

2) If you destroy the control missile, the other missiles will spread out. You can still destroy them but it is much harder to get the points for taking out the entire formation.

3) Try to maneuver in such a way as to be able to rapidly hit all the missiles. This is of course barring the fact there is no other things (rocks and mines) in the way that can destroy these missiles. This works well when they are in a line. If they are in a checkerboard pattern, you will have to move back and forth so you can hit everything but the control missile.

4) A synthesized voice stating 'Battle Stations' will announce when a formation is present.


* As mentioned before, if you take too long to take out the Enemy Stations, the condition will go to RED and enemy missiles will pour into the area with the only intent of ramming your ship.  You will know this also by the sound the machine makes.


* Continue to fly erratic patterns (unless you are going after Enemy Stations or formations) because the enemy missiles do move quicker then you do plus you will probably be able to take them out more effectively.


* Just as in "Time Pilot", there is a way you can stay on a level for as long as you want (This works best on level 2) : Stay away from all the bases, and fly horizontally from left to right. Just fire continuously at all the formations that come at you. The other ships will never be able to come after you. There is no time limit in the game, and it never gets any harder. You can stay on this level for as long as you want. It takes a VERY LONG TIME, though, to get a LARGE score.

Bowl-O-Rama (c) 1991 P&P Marketing.


This game has 3 different bowling variations to choose from 'Regulation Bowling', 'Flash-O-Matic', and 'BlackJack' :


* In 'Regulation Bowling' the rules and scoring are just like real bownling, following the regulations of the American Bowling Congress (ABC). In all three games players can join in at any time during the first frame.


* 'Flash-O-Matic' is a variation on the bowling theme. In this game a flashing score value moves back and forth across the alley. The player bowls, and the score value stops when the ball first hits a pin. If the player throws a strike he receives that score value. If he gets a spare he gets half the original value. If he fails to convert the spare then he gets 1 point for each pin that he did knock down. Scores can go up to nearly 10,000 points!


* In 'BlackJack' each player gets up to 3 throws to attempt to knock down 21 pins. Each time the full rack of ten pins is set. All pins knocked down by all players in one frame are added to the pot. The player who gets closest to 21 without going over gets all the points in the pot, and the pot is cleared to zero for the next frame. If a player gets 21 exactly then he gets twice the value in the pot. If 2 or more players tie in a frame they each get the points from the pot (or twice the points if they each have 21). Players who do not get closest to 21 or who bust (go over 21) get no points for the frame. Knocking down one pin scores as an ace, and is worth one or eleven, depending on what the player needs. his game is best played by several players together. The more players, the more points each frame is worth!

Boxing Bugs (c) 1981 Cinematronics.


This is kind of like a reverse of "Star Castle". In the center of the screen is a player-controlled rotating cannon, enclosed within an octagon. The cannon shoots fireballs from one end and has a boxing glove on an extension arm on the other end. The octagon is a protective wall for the cannon. Fireballs and the boxing glove pass over the wall to targets outside.

Bombs are randomly located outside the wall. Each bomb has a lite fuse. Three bugs are also randomly scattered outside the wall. The player's score, the number of cannons remaining, and the number of bugs that must be knocked out to complete the round are shown at the top of the screen.


- TECHNICAL -


Boxing Bugs ran on expanded version of the basic Cinematronics hardware platform. It added a ROM board and a color conversion board which allowed a color game to run on the otherwise monochrome Cinematronics vector platform. It used a Wells Gardner color X-Y monitor, and shipped in a rather unremarkable yellow cabinet that had plain 'Cinematronics' sideart painted on. The cabinet was similar to the one used for "Speed Freak", but not exactly the same.

A serious bug : Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners dont use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tileset rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the mainboard z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attract loop after gameover, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.

Bubble Bobble (c) 1986 Taito.


1 or 2 players take on the role of Bub and Bob, 2 cute dinosaurs who must battle through 100 platform-packed levels and rescue their girlfriends. Bub and Bob are armed only with the ability to make bubbles, in which the game's many enemies can be trapped and killed. The bubbles can also be used as temporary platforms, to help the dinosaurs reach previously inaccessible areas of a level.


The game's simple-yet-involving game-play saw Bubble Bobble become an instant classic. Its 2-player co-operative mode, coupled with the incredible amount of hidden secrets and potential for strategic play - unheard of in the platform genre - would set the standard by which all other platform games were judged.

Released in August 1986.

Licensed to Romstar for US manufacture and distribution (October 1986).


This was one of the first games to feature multiple endings.


The title of this game, Bubble Bobble, is a cross between the words 'bubble' and the name of the heroes : Bub and Bob.


The enemies are named (Round number of initial appearance applies to 'Normal' mode. For information on 'Super' mode, see Updates below) :

'Zen-Chan' [aka 'Bubble Buster', 'Benzo'] - First appears in Round 1

'Mighta' [aka 'Stoner', 'Boris'] - First appears in Round 6

'Monsta' [aka 'Beluga', 'Blubba'] - First appears in Round 10

'PulPul' [aka 'Hullaballoon', 'Boaboa'] - First appears in Round 20

'Banebou' [aka 'Coiley', 'Bonnie-bo'] - First appears in Round 30

'Hidegonsu' [aka 'Incendo'] - First appears in round 40

'Drunk' [aka 'Willy Whistle', 'Bonner'] - First appears in Round 50

'Invader' [aka 'Super Socket'] - First appears in Round 60

'Super Drunk' [aka 'Grumple Gromit'] - the boss character whom Bub and Bob fight in the final round

'Skel-Monsta' [aka 'Baron Von Blubba'] - Appears when you take too much time in a round

'Rascal' [aka 'Rubblen'] - Appears when you linger too long in a secret room


In 1996, Taito announced that they lost the original source code program to Bubble Bobble following a reorganization - when it came to the recent ports and sequels, they had to work from program disassembly, playing the game and (mainly) the various home computer ports.


The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'H.!', but go to the Tips and Tricks section for more information about 'SEX' :-)


Tom Gault holds the official record for this game with 5,823,600 points on March 4, 1988.


Some bootlegs of this game are known as "Bobble Bobble", "Miss Bubble II" and "Super Bobble Bobble".


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Taito Game Music - 28XA-110) on 25/01/1987


NES cover band The Advantage cover two songs from Bubble Bobble on their self-titled debut album released on April 6, 2004.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Bubble Bobble is a game heavily relying on game-play and precise technique rather than graphics, and it features a series of special techniques and tricks a player can perform to maximize his or her score, make some rounds of the game easier or faster to finish or just to be able to survive or even finish a round. Some of these techniques have special nicknames, which may differ from player to player and from country to country.


'Kissing monsters' or just kissing means killing a monster by blowing a bubble at almost contact distance : the monster will be instantly bubbled and the bubble will be instantly popped, giving the visual effect of the player killing a monster with a 'kiss'. Some players flip their joysticks in the opposite direction after pressing the bubble buttons, giving more chances of an 'instant pop' and changing flight direction for the dead monster. This technique is useful in stages where monsters move too fast, bubbles last for too short of a time or it's otherwise hard to bubble them normally. Of course good timing is required for this technique to work.


'Riding bubbles' means keeping the jump button pressed when dropping on a bubble: if done correctly, instead of popping the bubble, your dragon will instead jump on it, possibly continuously, enabling him to 'ride' bubbles in order to reach otherwise unreachable areas. Some stages can't be finished without this technique.


'Climbing' is a step up from riding bubbles. It means standing at half a bubble distance from a wall, jumping and blowing a bubble almost simultaneously, jumping up from that bubble and blowing another bubble and so on. This is necessary if the air current pushes down bubbles but you need to climb up. Having the rapid-bubbling power-up (the yellow candy) makes climbing a lot easier, especially if you got the running shoes already.


'Bubbling oneself through' means 'riding a bubble' through the opening at the top of a stage or even just through the ceiling of a stage in order to appear at the lower part, like some flying monsters can do. This technique is required to finish some stages or to get unstuck from some places, or just to save time.


'Blowing against the wall' means blowing bubbles against wall at contact distance : the bubbles will pop immediately thus giving the player 10 points per bubble pop. This can be used to either increase a player's score, or to set a player's score to a specific amount, in order to do other tricks.


'Two equal digits' means using the 'blowing against the wall' technique or other score-adjusting techniques in order to make the two penultimate (100s and 10s places) digits of at least one player equal, e.g., 456770, before the last enemy bubble is burst. If done correctly and the score is not modified when this occurs, then all remaining non-special bubbles on screen will be turned to 700-point bonuses, whose appearance depends on the digit picked. E.g., 7 gives Chocolate Ice Creams, 3 gives Hamburgers, and so on.

Note : this trick is easier to do with two players (one player adjusts his score and the other bursts the bubbles), but it can also be done with only one player, although calculating exactly how much (and if) one's score will be modified when bursting the last enemy bubbles can be extremely complex, if not unpredictable, especially if there are very large and clustered bubble bunches.

Note : Rounds with numbers ending with 5 and 0 up to and including level 50 generate bonuses from bubbles automatically, though, and some rounds (including round 1) do it by default.


Internal Counters : an interesting (and exploitable) part of bubble bobble is that powerups are not entirely random. As with the two digit trick, many internal counters in this game decide which special powers are available for collection. For example, rapid bubble shooting (a sweet in yellow wrapping), fast moving bubbles (a blue sweet), or fast moving bubbles (a blue sweet) appear shortly after either Bub or Bob jumps 51 times, pops 51 bubbles, or blows 51 bubbles. Also, running around a lot causes the speed powerup (red shoe) to appear. Keeping this is mind, it is possible to gain all powerups with relative ease. Although there are many more counters that control various aspects of the game, one of particular interest is the letters forming the word EXTEND. Getting all 7 letters will end the current level and award the player with an extra life 'NICE 1P!' - these letters have a greater chance of appearing when more enemies are defeated simultaneously. Also, gathering three of the same letter causes candy canes to appear which in turn lead to a special big item at the end of the level!


* Unlimited Run And Rapid Fire : at the main title screen, press Left, Jump, Left, 1P, Left, Fire, Left, 1P. If this is done correctly there will be a message in the bottom left corner of the title screen a red POWER UP!.


* Original Bubble Bobble : at the title screen press Shoot, Jump, Shoot, Jump, Shoot, Jump, Right, 1P. It will say at the bottom of screen ORIGINAL GAME. The game will give the PORTALS in some screens, if you can get in them you will get LOADS of diamonds.


* The 'Super Bubble Bobble' Code : this will change the Bubble Bobble logo in 'Super Bubble bobble' and the game will change under several points of view : different platform colors, different order for monster appearances (See 'Updates' above)... The code that must be entered at the title screen to access Super Bubble Bobble is displayed at the end of the credits after you beat the game in 2 players, normal mode. The message is coded, but it hints you to enter the secret room in level 20 to get the key for decoding. If you do so, you enter the secret room, on the base of which there is an inscription. The first line is the coding of the alphabet, the other lines are coded advices to beat the final boss. The decoded 'secret message' is : SJBLRJSR (Start - Jump - Bubble - Left - Right - Jump - Start - Right)


The decoded advices in the secret rooms are :

Room in level 20 : IF YOU WANT TO BECOME THE OLD FIGURE, USE THE POWER OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP, AND FIGHT WITH ME! (hint to play in two player mode to defeat the final boss and see the real ending)

Room in level 30 : I ENCLOSE THESE MAGICAL MEDICINE HERE, BECAUSE THOSE ARE MY WORST FEARS... (hint to use the lighting bubble to beat the boss)

Room in level 40 : IF YOU WANT TO GET BACK YOUR LOVE OF TRUTH, YOU MUST HELP EACH OTHER UNTILL THE LAST... (hint to end the game in two player mode to see the real endings)


A little more trivia on Super Bubble Bobble : if you beat the game in Super mode, two players, you will discover that the final boss is your mother and father that were controlled by some unknown evil. By defeating the boss you free them and your girlfriends, and are reverted back to your original human form (the one you play "Rainbow Island" with...)


* Secret Tombs : make it to level 20 without dying and a door appears -- it leads to a 'secret tomb', a level full of diamonds. There are secret tombs at levels 20 and 30, also. Make it to level 50 without dying and a strange, bee-hive-shaped door appears; enter it and you warp to level 70. DON'T kill the drunks on level 50, or the door disappears; bubble them and wait! Btw, with two players, only one of the players must survive unharmed to get the secret door.


* Paffing A Skel : Skel, also known as 'Baron Von Blubba', is that nasty white monster that comes after you when you've taken too long; with two players, two Skels will appear. If one player is killed by HIS Skel, then he can collide with his partner's Skel 'WHILE HE IS STILL FLICKERING'. If the player's icon is still flickering, the other player's Skel will disappear (poof!), with no harm to the once-slain character.


* Full Ending Sequence : beat the game in 2 Player in Super mode and you'll get the full end sequence.


* High Score Codes : after getting a high score, enter your initials as :

'SEX' - Pitch fork-flying cakes/vegetables/etc across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds.

'TAK' - Octopus-turns bubbles into X's at end of level.

'STR' - Flamingo-turns bubbles into smiling turds at end of level.

'KTT' - Beer-turns bubbles into pizzas at end of level, what a perfect match !!!

'...' - Knife-flying cakes/vegetables/etc across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds.

'I.F', 'MTJ', 'NSO', 'KIM', 'YSH' - Coke can-flying sunflowers across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds.

Bubbles (c) 1982 Williams.


In Bubbles you control a cartoon soap bubble inside a large sink. The object of the game is clean out the sink. You can safely scrub away ants, grease, and crumbs all the time. But sponges, roaches, brushes, and razor blades are deadly to a small bubble. Don't worry too much though, because your bubble grows in size as it swallows up the dirt in the sink. When it gets big enough it will be able to hit brushes and sponges (but still not razors).


- TECHNICAL -


Bubbles was available in 2 different upright cabinets, a standard wooden one, and the more uncommon plastic DuraMold cabinet. A mini (or cabaret) cabinet, and a cocktail. All 5 different varieties are pretty rare. On top of there being 5 different cabinets, there were also 2 different ROM revisions (the 'Red' and 'Blue' revisions). Making a grand total of 10 different Bubbles machines.

* The standard upright is in a dark blue cabinet (which is identical to one of the alternate "Robotron - 2084" cabinets). It is decorated with painted sideart of a bunch of bubbles coming up from a drain. The marquee matches the design of the sideart perfectly (a 'Bubbles' logo on a dark blue background, some of them also showed the main character, but many of them did not). The control panel features an 8-Way optical joystick that has an incredible feel, but is prone to breakage.

* The DuraMold cabinet was a round cabinet made completely out of thick plastic. This was an experiment in making an indestructible arcade cabinet that would last forever. There were a few other DuraMold games made, but Bubbles was the most common one by far. The DuraMold Bubbles was a big blue plastic cylinder with no sideart. It had a curved marquee on top that had the same graphics as the standard upright. The control panel had the same joystick that the upright model used, but the graphics on it were more detailed (cartoon images of characters from the game, as opposed to a simple design).

* The cabaret and cocktail models were identical in design to their "Robotron - 2084" counterparts. Both of these had very limited production runs.

- TRIVIA -


By 1983 it seemed every possible idea had been used in a video game except the kitchen sink. Then came Bubbles.


'What I was trying to do with Bubbles was come up with a non-violent, clean game (no pun intended)' says John Kotlarik. The game was intended to be a "Pac-Man" inspired take-off with a free form play field instead of walls. Kotlarik came up with the initial concept and Python Anghelo created all the artwork and wrote the game scenario.


Python had previously worked on many other Williams games, including much of the art for Joust. Kotlarik had helped out on the sounds for "Joust" and "Defender", as well as creating the voice for Williams' first voice synthesized pinball game, "Gorgar". Together they brought the kitchen sink to life.


The early '80s were an era populated with off the wall video game characters like Q-Bert, Dig Dug and Mr. Do. Even then, the cast of Bubbles stood out from the crowd. The game had crumbs, ants, greasies, sponges, brushes and the Cleaning Lady. It was certainly the only game ever to create a character out of something as sinister and bizarre as a razor blade. Piloting your scrubbing bubble, the goal was to scour sink after sink of scurrying scum.


The big challenge of programming the game was creating the drift movement of the free floating player bubble, which was a lot more complex than meets the eye. They wanted to program the bubble to move like it was on ice, or water, and not a hard surface track. To do this, Kotlarik had to do what he calls the damping of the velocity profile. The longer you held the joystick down, the faster you would go and experience a slight decrease in velocity once you started to coast. It was an attempt to make an analog control out of an eight way digital joystick. The game had different movement than any other immediate response game of its kind.


Bubbles also had innovative cabinet design. The wood cabinet graphics, created by Anghelo, were some of the best of all the Williams classic games. Anghelo also came up with the concept for a unique all plastic cabinet for Bubbles. Mechanical engineer Gary Berge developed it by using a special rotational molding process. The shape was cylindrical with a domed top. The Bubbles cabinets were in blue plastic. Black plastic ones were created for Blaster and a handful of "Sinistar" test machines. The plastic cabinets were almost indestructible. When crushed, they would spring back to shape like an accordion. When blemished, they could easily be fixed by heating and smoothing the plastic. 'If we'd made kits for those things we could have easily sold a couple hundred thousand', says Tom Cahill of the Williams service department.


Bubbles created a play environment like no other game of its time. The humorous animated action was a nice complement to Williams' cadre of famous sci-fi pulse racers.


Yashiro Oda holds the official record for this game with 1,566,960 points on August 1, 1984.


A Bubbles machine was shown at the 2003 classic arcade games show 'California Extreme' in San Jose, California.


- UPDATES -


A little known strategy of the game is available once your bubble becomes large enough to have a face. The sponges and brush can no longer destroy it. Working from the right angle, a player can rack up extra points by shoving the sponges and brushes down the drain. The only drawback is that every time you throw your weight around in this manner you lose a little in size, until eventually you become vulnerable again.


- SCORING -


Crumb : 100 Points.

Ants : 150 Points.

Greasie : 200 Points (can be conquered if you collect the Cleaning Lady and gain her sweeping skill to bump it into the drain).

Cleaning Lady : 500 Points (will increase as she collects items).

Roach : 1000 Points (can be conquered if you collect the Cleaning Lady and gain her sweeping skill to bump it into the drain).

Dive Ahead Bonus : x1000 Points per bubble enlargement.

Around the Drain : x2 Points (if you get the above items around the drain).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Keep moving... You won't attract dirt if you just stand there. Also, Roaches are like heat-seeking missiles... they won't aimlessly wander because they WANT you.


* Go around the circumference/perimeter off the sink first, since they are the easiest to collect. Then work your way inwards.


* Dirt and crumbs will slowly head for thee drain so you could spin around the drain, collecting them as they come.


* If the drain is flashing RED, back off! A Giant Ant/Roach is coming your way! Seek and capture the Cleaning Lady's broom (if there is one) to counter this threat.


* Do not try to out-run Roaches, because they are actually faster than your poor, slow-poke Bubble. Instead, out-maneuver them. Go in circles around them and pick up materials in the process. Once you have a smile, bid the ugly duckling farewell and head for the drain before you get bitten!


* If there is a low supply of materials abroad and you're not even close to getting a smile on your face... don't get the materials because it would speed your death up. Instead, use the remaining time to wait for the green light and go in! It might take a while. Hell, maybe the light will never come...


* DON'T BE SELFISH! You might want to try to collect more materials when you have a big, big smile on your face... it's not worth it. Take the safe road and go into the drain before someone kicks your head in.


* Try to collect the items around the drain, you get 2x points that way.


* Once you have a smile on your face, you can make the brushes/sponges bounce off without getting blown up. Try to aim them to the drain to add injury to the insilt!


* Not really a tip... but the number of the level you are currently playing is on the top left corner. Once it goes past 99, it comes back to 01.

Burger Time (c) 1982 Data East.


Burger Time is a 1- or a 2-player game that puts you in control of chef Peter Pepper. Direct him through the maze of ladders and platforms to build his burgers. Your job is to give him guidance while building his burgers and to keep him away from his pursuing enemies - Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Egg, and Mr. Pickle.


The enemies are very sneaky and, if given half a chance, will try to corner Peter at the end of one of the platforms or to trap him on one of the ladders he has to use to get from one level of platforms to another.


The enemies have no defense mechanisms of any kind. But they cannot be permanently eliminated either. As soon as Peter puts one enemy out of commission, another appears somewhere on the screen at the edge of one of the platforms.


However, in an emergency, Peter can slow the enemies down for short periods of time. This is accomplished by having him throw pepper on them. When hit by the pepper, the enemies will be disabled for several seconds. When they are disabled like this, Peter can walk right over them and not be caught.


As your skill level increases, the number and direction of enemies coming at Peter at any one time and the speed with which they move, is gradually increased; plus, their pursuit patterns become more and more devious while their overall accuracy is highly improved.


Bonus lives are awarded periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values. Each task or event that Peter can perform or cause to happen has an assigned point value.


The object of the game is to survive as long as possible while constantly improving your skills and building as many Burgers as you can. As you do this, each following rack of the game will have more enemies, more difficult mazes, and will in general be harder to complete.

- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1982, the game was originally titled 'Hamburger' in Japan, but was renamed 'Burger Time' before being introduced to the United States.


Burger Time was originally made for the Deco Cassette System ("Burger Time (DC)"), an early arcade format that pulled the game data from audio cassettes. The cassette system enjoyed a brief bit of popularity, until it was discovered that the cassettes quickly wore out, rendering the game useless. Bally Midway licensed this title soon after its original release (october 1982), and redesigned the hardware to drop the cassette altogether. This version of the game sold vast quantities when compared to the original. There was also a bootleg version of this game that bore the title "Cook Race".


Bryan Wagner holds the official record for this game with 11,512,500 points on September 19, 2008.


A sequel called "Pizzatime" was planned around 1984 but was never released.


In Japan where the game was made, it is common to add a fried egg to your burger. Hence, Mr. Egg as one of the Food Foes.


- UPDATES -


* The Bally Midway licensed version has a different attract mode.

* If you run out of pepper in the Bally Midway licensed version, a special sound effect will play, signaling this.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* 'Mad Dash' : J.D. Lowe, the current world record holder adds some suggestions... Something that very few players use is something I call 'Mad Dash'. If you watch as the chef is drawn on the screen, he walks up/down ladders at approx. 8 steps a second. So, in theory, if you can press the up and down arrows faster than 8 times a second, you can go faster. This is very helpful on later levels like Level 20. This does not work on going left and right, because the steps are smaller, and the computer has to draw the chef facing you again if you let go of the controller. It's a bit complicated, but like I said earlier, it can be very helpful.


* Peppers Appearances : The peppers do not appear randomly on the screen; in fact, they appear after so many ingredients have fallen to the bottom of the screen...

Level 1 - Peppers appear after 4, 8, and 12 ingredients have dropped.

Level 2 - After 5, 7, and 13 ingredients.

Level 3 - 4, 8, and 13.

Level 4 - 6, 16, 22, and 29.

Level 5 - 3, 6, and 9.

Level 6 - 3, 7, 12, and 14.


* Enemies can't turn around immediately, so you can follow them around temporarily.


* The best tactic is generally to stand halfway across a piece of food, wait for enemies to appear on the burger piece's edge, and then drop the burger piece and the enemies at once. Always lure the enemies onto the highest portion of the screen, and then drop them. This has several advantages : it clears more burger pieces, plus it means that units on lower levels may wander into the cascading pieces, killing them also.


* Leave plenty of room around yourself when going up ladders - the sprites in Burger Time are somewhat bigger than the visible characters.


* When enemies first appear, you have 1/4 sec to go through them, if you need to.


* IMPORTANT : If you get caught by an enemy while the last piece of food is falling into place, the game will NOT deduct a life from your game!

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* The game have a 'anti-leeching' tool. If you delay a lot of minutes (between 4 and 5 minutes) on the same stage/screen, you will receive a hard 'rain of bombs', like that bombs the airplanes shoot on you. Try to do it on the stage 1-1, the easiest. And if you delay a lot of time in the same position of the 'enemy' bar, without progress, you will receive this rain of bombs easily. Yeah, if you are expert, you will can survive to these bombs, without die, using your skill on the 'rolling' move. You will receive a lot of items (bombs, weapons) if you destroy bombs or if you shoot at the bush.


* General Tips :

1) Killing people and motorcycles (and rocks) won't get you many points -- don't bother unless they get in your way.

2) A well-placed grenade will destroy two choppers.

3) If you are in a corner and a chopper is firing at you, run farther into the corner. Even if you're already IN the corner, if it sees you trying to move toward the corner, you won't die.

4) If you find yourself trapped by incoming bullets, spin the trackball down and to one side (but mostly down). This will cause your character to 'duck and roll'. If you are rolling, you can't be hit.

5) Kill the snipers (the guys in gray bullet-proof suits). Half the time you'll get a grenade for killing him. If you don't, two medics will come running out to reclaim the body. Shoot these medics as much as possible! Each shot they will drop 1 grenade. But the limit is 4 granades on the screen at the same time. Pick up these grenades as quickly as possible and shoot the medics again for more grenades. Sometimes they will drop new weapons too.

6) On the level one screen with the sliding doors : shoot out the doors immediately upon starting the level. This will stop the guys from lobbing grenades at you.

7) Airplanes are hard to kill. The best method is by using machine gun or bazooka gun on it. In the absence of a super-gun, you can lead a grenade ABOVE where it is on the screen. If you don't get it, and the three bombs are being dropped right on you, it IS possible to stand BETWEEN where two bombs are coming down. You WON'T die!

8) When there's nothing good to shoot on the screen, fire at a bush. This is the way to get extra gunnery! Sometimes you'll only get more grenades, but you'll eventually get a super-gun!


* Tips For Specific Enemies :

1) The giant chopper that shows up at the end of screen 4 on level one doesn't give you any points until you destroy it. Shooting the orange bullets won't knock off any points toward killing the chopper. Only shoot the orange bullets if they're in your way. Otherwise, spend all your time shooting the chopper. Don't waste any grenades on the chopper--it doesn't do as much damage as your gun (and you have unlimited bullets).

2) The semi-truck that shows up at the end of screen 4 on level three will self-destruct if you destroy the CAB (the blue section in the front of it). On this screen you actually get the point for it as well. It is easiest to kill it with the machine gun and/or bazooka gun, but in the absence of either of these, throw grenades at the cab (leading the throw by about four inches). It is MUCH easier to destroy the cab rather than destroying all the attack sections that it drops off.

3) The three CPUs that show up at the end of screen 4 on level four can actually be destroyed with only 2 grenades (I had to do this once when my grenade supply got low), but the best strategy is to lob five grenades at one of the outside CPUs (note that you can only have four grenades per player in the air at any given time, so space them out a bit), then go for the CENTER one (with another five grenades). The final CPU can simply be shot with the standard rifle, and if you're standing on the opposite side of the screen from it, it won't be able to hit you. Don't waste any more grenades.

4) Once you learn how to defeat the final menace (at the end of screen 4 on level five -- the final level) you can get by it (rather) painlessly. Go all the way to one side. Use your gun to shoot out the two surrounding machines that are shooting at you. As soon as they are both gone, lob three grenades at the center machine. By this time, the two outer machines that you shot out have regenerated and are firing at you. Shoot them out again, followed by another volley of three grenades to the center machine. Repeat until the center machine is gone. This requires 20 to 40 grenades, so stock up on the last level (5-4). That is what that final level was for.

* Debug Mode (in Debug Mode, you will be able to select starting scene, gold, EXP and several items) :

1) Hold Service Switch and reset the game.

2) Wait until 'Service Switch Error Message' is displayed, then push 'Start(x3), Service, Start'.

3) The game boots up then insert a credit and select a character.

4) Enter Debug Mode instead of starting the game.


* Your character jumps backwards when hit by an enemy. When you're trying to quickly cross some areas where you're likely to take damage, this can be a bad thing; it can cause you to stay in the dangerous area much longer. So, to reduce the damage, turn back just before you get hit. This will cause the impact to push you -forward-, getting you out of danger more quickly.


* The maximum amount of money you can have is 60,000 Golds.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


On the 2nd and 5th stages, there appears a large dinosaur called a Shivat that's sleeping when first encountered. Try to keep the human enemies from whacking them to wake them up. While the Shivats do attack the enemies, they can also cause trouble (and injuries) for the players.


There are also some pterodactyl-like flying creatures that need to be struck by jumping to reach them. Whenever you drain the energy from any menacing dinosaurs, they slightly change color, then become harmless.


On the 3rd stage, where you're driving Jack's Cadillac, try to dodge the grenades thrown by the stage's motorcycle-riding boss, Hogg, while crashing into him with the car. If you're good at this, you should be able to at least reduce his energy to the yellow level, the lowest for the enemies.


On the 6th stage, there's 2 points at where you need to be careful not to be stomped on by the legs of a brontosaurus. But, try to lure some of the other enemies underneath them instead!

Cameltry (c) 1990 Taito.


The player must guide a ball through a number of mazes, rotating the maze through 180 degrees to get the ball to move in the desired direction - much like the bonus levels in the Sega Megadrive console title, 'Sonic the Hedgehog'. Each maze must be completed within a tight time limit and a number of traps and obstacles litter the mazes to slow players down.


There are, however, a number of postitive targets to be hit, and bonuses - such as additional time - can be found hidden away within the mazes. When the ball is stuck or the player would like to speed up, the JUMP button can be used. If the player runs out of time before reaching the goal, a random matching game is run to allow the player more time to complete the maze. This challenge, however is very difficult to win.

Canyon Bomber (c) 1977 Atari.


Canyon Bomber is a 2-D shooter. You control either the blimp or the plane while dropping bombs on the rocks below. Your goal is to get the highest amount of points (either against the computer or another player). You are allowed so many misses before your game ends. Misses are counted as the times you do not hit any rocks. The scores for the rocks are directly proportional to the difficulty in hitting those rocks. This game boils down to precision bombing and thinking ahead as to where the next bomb will fall. Good luck in taking out all of the rocks in the canyon.

- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1977.


Atari was at the top of the arcade battle in 1977. Releasing no fewer then nine arcade games, Atari was the dominating force and standard that videogames were based on. Many of Atari's games were simple games of skill and hand-eye coordination.


Canyon Bomber is Howie's second Atari project ("Super Bug" was his first). The author describes his game as 'upside-down Breakout' and says it was a far superior two-player competitive game than when played one person versus the computer. He modified the "Sprint 2"'s circuitry, then programmed it.


David Nelson of Manchester, New Hampshire holds the official record for this game with 1,399 points on November 17, 2007.


- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is pretty simple, you get the points that are displayed on the rocks as you destroy them :

1 : One point

2 : Two points

3 : Three points

4 : Four points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, you will be on the left side of your screen in a blimp. If two players are playing, then player 1 controls the black blimp while player 2 controls the white blimp. If you are playing one player, then you control the black blimp. The goal is to get as many points as you can while avoiding misses. There are two types of aircraft in this game : Blimps and airplanes. You need to know the differences between them since your bombing accuracy is directly related to their movements.

1) Blimps tend to stay at higher altitudes and move slowly. This gives you more time to plan your bomb run.

2) Planes tend to stay at the middle and lower altitudes and move fast. This gives you very little time to plan your bomb run.


* In order to effectively drop bombs, there are a couple of things you should take into account :

1) Your forward speed will have a direct impact as to where the bomb lands. For example, you need to drop your bomb earlier to hit a specific target instead of dropping it when you are directly over the target. The reason is because the bomb will drift in the direction you are flying when it is dropped.

2) Your altitude has a lot to do with where your bombs will fall. The higher you are, the harder it will be to hit ground targets since the bomb will only drift so much from point one. Higher altitudes also tend to make the perspective harder when trying for rocks in valleys and on ledges.


* You can only take out the rocks you are headed toward. This may seem like common sense but sometimes people attempt to 'lob' a bomb over a hill on the valley floor hoping to hit the rocks just on the other side of the hill. Unfortunately, it doesn't work.


* Bombs don't 'wrap' around the screen. Your aircraft will go back and forth at random altitudes. Right when your aircraft turns for another pass, start planning on where you want to drop your next bomb.


* When the game first starts, you can take out four to five numbered rocks. As the game progresses, though, these numbers go down sharply.


* If you are fortunate enough to eliminate all the rocks in the canyon, the canyon will fill back up again. This will happen a maximum of three times (counting the first wave). After that, the game is over.


* The game is based on misses. If your opponent uses up all their misses, you can still continue until you use up all of your misses. The same is true if you use up all of your misses.


* Whenever you hit rocks under other rocks, those top rocks will settle to the next rock. In other words, you can blast the middle out of the rockpiles but they will still settle to the bottom of the canyon.


* Try to clear lanes to the three and four pointers for a higher score (The three and four points rocks are usually located on ledges or in narrow valleys).


* When you clear out half the rocks in the canyon, you will change over from the blimp to the airplane.

Released in August 1988.


This game was originally supposed to be titled 'Beer Frame Bowling'.


Scott Spencer holds the official record for this game with a perfect score of 300 points on November 18, 2008.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint 1 : To get a strike most of the time, position the ball between the 3rd and 4th dot behind the foul line. Also, move the ball closer to the foul line, but do NOT cross it. The closer you move the ball to the foul line, the more you may need to nudge your ball a little to the left. This is because when the ball travels slow enough on the lane, it will hook to the right.


* Hint 2 : If the ball is over the line when you position your ball, and you have not thrown it, you can move it back behind the line with no foul (which is necessary if over half of the ball is across the line...a foul will be called if you try throwing it from that position).

Released in September 1991.


CAPtain COMmando = CAPCOM


The stages of the game takes place in "Final Fight"'s Metro City, but in the year 2026.


Captain Commando is Capcom's own homage to classic American sci-fi shows and magazines and the work of artists like Frank R. Paul. It was not the only game, though; "Battle Circuit" is even a better example of Capcom's enthusiasm for this stuff.


Each of the player's button on the dedicated 4-player cabinet uses a unique two-in-one play action button design : 2 large half circle buttons (red & blue) placed straight side by straight side to form one big circle, thus making two buttons look like one big button cut in half vertically.


Mack the Knife's name is based on a song made popular in the mid 1950's by Louis Armstrong.


Ginzu the ninja's name comes from the ginzu kitchen knives which were introduced in the 1970's which were made famous by its TV advertising campaign.


Sho (Ginzu the ninja's Japanese name) is probably based on Sho Kosugi who is a japanese actor who is known for his portrayals of ninjas in various movies in the 1980's.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Captain Commando : G.S.M. Capcom 5 - PCCB-00083) on 21/03/1992.

Carnival [Cocktail model] (c) 1980 Sega Enterprises, Ltd.


A shooting gallery game. Fire a gun at owls, bunnies, ducks, pipes, bonus letters, and other positive or negative bonus items.


- TECHNICAL -


There were 2 different cocktail cabinets available for this game. The 2 cocktails seem to represent 2 different generations of the Sega/Gremlin cocktail, the only differences between them are the control panel and coin mechs (Both cocktail cabinets were also used for other Sega games such as "Frogger").


The cocktail versions used small 13in. monitors and were relatively unadorned. The older ones had a larger control panel and different coin mechs. The only decoration was a set of instruction cards underneath the top glass (the cards were the same for both versions). These machines used small 2-Way joysticks for movement (instead of push buttons).

Fred Pastore holds the official record for this game with 386,750 points on June 3, 2001.


A Carnival unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.


- UPDATES -


The upright and cocktail versions of this game used 2 different sets of PCBs. They both use the same wiring harness, but the cocktail version flips the display for the second player. This is a bit of an anomaly, usually games simply have a switch on the mainboard to switch between upright and cocktail mode.


- SCORING -


Shooting the bonus box at the top left : the score inside the box (+ or -).

Shooting an object in the top row scores the points at the right of the screen level with the top row (50, 60, etc).

A hit in the 2nd row scores the points at the right of the screen level with the 2nd row (30, 40, etc).

A hit in the bottom row scores the points at the right of the screen level with the bottom row (10, 20, etc).

A hit on a polar bear in the intermission screen scores 50 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Make any ducks on the lowest level your priority at the start of a screen, as they will soon swoop down to steal some of your ammunition.


* Keep an eye out for the passing boxed '5' and '10' symbols, as these award 5 or 10 extra bullets respectively when shot. You won't have enough ammo to complete a screen without at least hitting a few of these.


* You can stay to the left of the screen, which will enable you to pick off any good bonuses in the bonus box at an early stage. Don't get too trigger happy though, or you might be dropping your score or losing a lot of ammo too quickly if you hit a negative 'bonus'.


* The key to getting a lot of hits on the polar bear(s) in the bonus stage is to concentrate on only one bear and hit it as close to dead centre as possible. If you do this keep firing rapidly and you'll rack up a few points as it won't be able to escape from a constant barrage of bullets.


* Extra bullet '5' and '10's only appear on the top two rows and don't reappear at the top after going offscreen from the middle row so make sure you pick them off whenever possible.

Carnival [Upright model] (c) 1980 Sega.


CARNIVAL is a 1 or 2 player alternate action game that simulates a carnival shooting gallery. The playfield consists of three target rows, a rotating pipe wheel, a bonus message panel, and a 'special' target block.


The player uses a left right control to position a rifle at the bottom of the screen, and a shoot control to fire the rifle. Two rows of bullets at the bottom of the screen indicate the number of shots remaining to the player. Every time the player shoots, one of the bullets disappears from the screen. More bullets are given during the first round than the others, so, the inexperienced player will have a chance to enjoy the play.


The game ends when the player runs out of bullets. This can occur on any round. A round ends when the player clears the playfield of all targets. At this point, a special 'shoot the bear' sequence appears, and when this is finished the player proceeds to the next more difficult (and higher scoring) round. This is Gremlin's Multi-Phase design concept that keeps games challenging to players of all levels.


When a player completes a round (ending with 'shoot the bear' sequence), the screen flips to the other player. When the original player resumes play, he advances to the next level of difficulty, exactly as he would have if the screen had not flipped to the other player. This method allows the players to more directly compare their scores, since they are always within one round of each other. Note that the player who ends the game first does not necessarily lose--he might still have the higher score when the game ends.


The three target rows move in a horizontal line from left to right (top row), right to left (middle row) and left to right (bottom row). There are five types of targets. The rows move as a continuous band--the targets exiting the playfield from the right side of the bottom row reappear at the left of the top row. The point value for hitting a row target is indicated along the right side of the game--maximum points for a top row target, medium points for a middle row target, and minimum points for a bottom row target. These values increase from round to round.


Rabbits and owls are simple targets, which disappear when hit.


Numbered sign targets award additional bullets to the player when hit, as well as awarding the points indicated for the row. These targets appear only on the top two rows to make them relatively difficult targets.


Five small letters, B, 0, N, U and S are randomly interspersed through the target rows. At the upper right of the playfield is the word ''bonus" spelled out is small letters. If the player manages to hit the moving bonus letters in order (b-o-n-u-s) a special bonus is awarded. The fact that the bonus is still active is shown by the bonus word in the upper right of the playfield. Every time a bonus letter in the correct order is hit, the small corresponding letter in the bonus panel enlarges to show that it has been hit. Whenever a bonus letter is hit out of order, the bonus panel disappears until the next round. The bonus panel reappears at the beginning of every round. The bonus value is determined by adding row target points into the bonus value. When the "B" letter is hit, the bonus value freezes for that round. This encourages waiting as long as possible before attempting to score the bonus.


Ducks are special targets. Whenever a duck reaches the bottom row, it is capable of leaving the row and flying down toward the player. If the duck manages to get past the player's rifle without being shot, it flies down to the bullet row and quickly eats 10 bullets. A maximum of three ducks can escape simultaneously.


The target rows move as a continuous band of targets, and no new owls, rabbits, or bonus letter targets are added once the round starts. 'More shots' targets and ducks are added during a round. The frequency of adding duck targets is tied to the round number. As the rounds get more difficult, more ducks are added as the round progresses.


A flying duck hit scores no points.


Bullets left over at the end of a round earn 50 points each.


The between rounds 'shoot the bear' sequence operates as a shooting gallery bear. Whenever the bear is hit, it rears up, roars, and continues motion in the opposite direction. Each hit speeds up the bear, and increases the point value, which is shown above the bear for each hit. When the bear leaves the screen (which it will always do eventually, since it speeds up with each hit) the between rounds sequence ends and a new round begins. As the rounds progress, more bears (a maximum of 4) appear on the screen simultaneously.


A special yellow-rimmed score panel appears in the upper left of the playfield, and stays on for random lengths of time. Four types of panels appear here, which either add or subtract points or bullets. Hitting any part of the panel border awards the score shown inside.


The bullet bonus panel is shown with a large plus sign, and a row of bullets. Immediately after appearing, the bullets begin disappearing fairly rapidly. When the bullets are depleted, the panel disappears. If hit, the player is awarded the number of bullets left in the panel when it was hit.


The score bonus is shown with the same large plus sign, and a score value. As with the bullets, the score value quickly decreases, until it hits zero and disappears.


The minus panels are similar to those above except a large minus sign indicates the number of bullets or points subtracted when hit. This discourages the practice of parking on the left margin and shooting--a miss will hit the negative target. These panels show a fixed number of bullets or points, and after a random time interval, disappear.


The pipe wheel contains 8 pipes of 4 different colors. A panel beneath the wheel restricts pipe hits to horizontally oriented pipes, and also indicates the point value for hitting a pipe. Every shot the player takes decrements the pipe value, except a shot which hits a pipe. This makes it advisable to hit pipes early in the round, when it is most difficult (since the player must shoot through heavily populated target rows). Hitting two pipes of the same color with two consecutive shots awards a bonus of four times the pipe value shown in the panel.


CARNIVAL is accompanied by background music. At the beginning of every round, the music begins at a slow rate and relatively low key. As the round progresses, the music speeds up and the melody shifts up in key. This gives the player a growing sense of urgency. As the round progresses, the playfield motion also gradually speeds up.


A small panel on the right of the playfield contains a musical note symbol. If the player wishes to turn off the music, he simply shoots the note panel. This makes the note disappear, and turns off the music. Hitting the panel again makes the note reappear and resumes the music. The note thus acts as a 'flip-flop' switch to turn the music on and off.


Every round begins with the music on.


There is a special case to consider near the end of a round: the player has cleared all of the targets except the ducks, and has plenty of bullets left so that he can simply sit and wait for the ducks. He would, in effect, prolong the game by refusing to end the round.


Theoretically, by hitting the ducks and 'more shots' signs, the round could be prolonged indefinitely. However, an internal "doomsday" timer in the game keeps track of how long a round has lasted. After a certain time limit (the same for each round), the frequency of new duck appearances increases dramatically.


The top 3 scores are shown during advertising, along with the player's initials. A player who scores in the top 3 is allowed to enter 3 initials by a special routine explained at the time of their writing. The rank is updated during the round. The player is both audibly and visually rewarded. There is a pronounced audible sound as the player's score passes that of another ranking player's score. And, they may watch their rank progress during the game.


CARNIVAL's basic play action is outlined below, as it appears in the game instructions.


Shoot all targets and pipes to advance to the next round.

Game is over when you run out of bullets.

Escaped ducks eat 10 bullets.

Hit B-O-N-U-S letters in sequence for special bonus. Bonus value stops increasing when 'B' is hit.

Hit same color pipes with 2 consecutive shots to score 4 times pipe value. Shoot number signs for more bullets.

Shoot the bear between rounds for extra points.

Centipede (c) 1980 Atari.


Centipede is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster-scan monitor. The fast-moving game action takes place on a playfield filled with mushrooms and includes a variety of insects that drop down from the top of the screen or enter from the sides of the screen, most of them to attack the Bug Blaster, controlled by the player. The Bug Blaster is represented on the screen by a somewhat humanoid head. The object of the game is to shoot at and destroy as many of these insects and mushrooms as possible for a high point score, before the player's lives are all used up.


Player control consists of a Mini-Trak Ball control and a FIRE button. The Bug Blaster is moved by rotating the Mini-Trak Ball control. The Bug Blaster can be moved in all directions, but only within the bottom 5th of the screen. However, the Bug Blaster must move around mushrooms, since these are fixed, not 'transparent', objects. Pressing the FIRE button causes the Bug Blaster to fire individual shots upward, either singly or in rapid-fire mode, if held down constantly (Only one shot appears on the screen at a time).


Game play begins with a playfield of randomly placed mushrooms. A Centipede starts snaking its way across from the center top of the screen. The Centipede changes direction when it runs into a mushroom or either the left or right boundaries of the playfield.


When a segment of the Centipede is shot, it is destroyed and a mushroom appears where that segment was shot. When shot, the Centipede breaks into two smaller centipedes, each with its own head. When a Centipede reach the bottom of the screen, it starts back up, but remains within the area of the Bug Blaster (the bottom fifth of the screen).


If a Centipede reaches the bottom of the screen without being shot, it releases its tail. This tail changes into a new head. Also to provide the player a challenge, if a Centipede is still alive when it reaches the bottom, new heads will enter the screen almost at the bottom of the sides. More of these heads will appear as time progresses.


A round of play ends when all Centipede segments are destroyed.


The randomly moving Spiders also appear in the first wave. The Spiders can destroy any mushrooms they move over. This eliminates many mushroom targets for a player. Depending on a special option switch setting, the Spider moves slowly until the player reaches a specific score, and then it speeds up. If the Bug Blaster and a Spider collide, both are destroyed.


A bombardment of Fleas starts after the first wave; as the Flea descends, it leaves a trail of new mushrooms behind it. The Fleas appear when a certain number of mushrooms remains at the bottom of the screen. This number increases as the game progresses, meaning Fleas appear more often later on in the game. The Bug Blaster must hit a Flea twice to destroy it; the first shot just speeds it up.


When a Centipede with fewer than eleven segments appears, a Scorpion enters from either side, moving at a relatively slow speed. As the player earns more points, the Scorpion's speed increases.


As the Scorpion travels across the screen, it 'poisons' the mushrooms that it moves over and changes their colors. These mushrooms cause any Centipedes that would collide with them to head straight towards the bottom of the screen, rather than continue snaking around. The Bug Blaster can stop a poisoned Centipede by shooting its head.


In addition, these poisoned mushrooms as well as any partially shot mushrooms add 5 points to the player's score as the playfield resets after a player loses a life.


If the players are very skilled and earn at least 60,000 points, two things happen to increase player challenge : the Fleas descend at a faster speed and the Spiders restrict their movement to a smaller area at the bottom of the screen.


An important new feature of this game is the operator option for easy/hard game difficulty. In the easy game, the Spider moves slowly up to a 5,000-point score, and then bounces at a higher speed. It also changes direction less often throughout the game than at the hard setting.


In the hard setting, the Spider moves slowly only for the first 1,000 points, and then speeds up. It also changes direction more often throughout the game. In either setting, the spider always moves at a 45-degree angle or straight up and down.

Centipede came in 3 different form factors, upright, cabaret, and a cocktail table.

* The uprights were by far the most common. All of them can be converted to "Millipede" with only minor effort. They all have control panels with a trackball, although the upright version uses a larger ball than the other ones do. All of the trackballs are prone to wear and tear, but replacement parts are readily available. The upright was in a white cabinet that was similar in construction to the Asteroids cabinet. The game featured ornate painted side-art of a truly evil looking green bug, while the monitor bezel and marquee basically copied the same picture, but from a different angle.

* The cabaret was an ugly looking little thing, with wood-grained sides, and a nameplate down by the coin box.

* The cocktail version is black and wood-grained, and has two control panels. The only graphics on this one are a pair of Centipede logos underneath the glass (the same design is also repeated on the control panels.

- TRIVIA -


Centipede, completed in 1981, was an Atari coin-operated game that swiftly won a wide following in the arcades. Apart from its smooth game play, Centipede was praised for its refreshing approach to screen colors and for its whimsical mushroom world.


The first coin-op game designed by a woman, Dona Bailey. But Ed Logg did the majority of the work on Centipede, Dona only came up with the prototype idea, where the mushrooms were indestructible and it was more like "Space Invaders". Like "Pac-Man", this game has special appeal to women.


* The Creation of Centipede : Centipede was written by veteran Atari designer Ed Logg, who has become something of a legend in the world of video games, and a young game programmer who was credited with bringing a gentler touch to the world of video games with the enchanted mushroom patch. Steve Calfee : "Ed Logg is the world's greatest games designer. He's done the most, the best games. His line up starts with "Asteroids", which probably still is the biggest run we ever did. He's in [a long line of games]. He's kind of like Pete Rose; he has the most hits and he's also probably got the most strike outs. He just goes up to bat.".


* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters : The mushroom patch with its tenacious, never-say-die centipedes, bouncing spiders, mushroom-laying fleas and transforming scorpions provided an imaginative leap for players, just as did the hoards of aliens in "Tempest", the outer space adventures of "Asteroids", the eerie battlefields of "Battle Zone" and even the frightful scenarios of "Missile Command". Of these times, and the games that emerged from Atari, Rich Adam said : "We were a young group of fun people who were sort of treading on untrodden territory. We were out exploring what technology could do to entertain adolescent minds, and we were adolescent minds.".

In the early days of personal computers, before they became commonplace, and before sophisticated gaming programs were available for them, the arcades (and wherever else the coin-operated games were located) were the portals into these new fantasy worlds. And a river of quarters carried players into the electronic realms. Dan Pliskin described the coin-operated video game business as follows : "It was a wacky, extremely competitive business. I was there when coin-operated games were earning $8 billion in quarters a year. These games were out-grossing the record industry and the movie industry combined, in quarters! And when you looked at who was manufacturing these games, it was just a couple of Japanese companies and a few American companies.... There was incredible competition, all for kids' lunch and church money!".

The quarters are still rolling in. Dan Plishkin continued : "People say that video games have already seen their heyday and business has definitely gone downhill. Maybe it has gone downhill. Maybe it's only $4 billion worth of quarters now. It's still one heck of an industry.".


* Popular from the Start : The prototype games were hand-built, wire-wrapped, one-of-a kinds that were created by the development team prior to ordering the circuit boards for the mass-produced versions. With just a single machine, people would come in at all hours of the night to play a new game.Dan Plishkin : "One of the things that kind of allowed everybody at Atari to have kind of a loose and enjoyable relationship was that management was kind of loose, too. An example of that happened with one of Howard Delman's games. I can't remember which one it was, but we sent the one and only prototype wire-wrapped version of Howie's game off to the AMOA (Amusement and Music Operators Association) show with strict orders not to sell it. "Of course the game was sold anyway, and a new prototype had to be assembled back at the labs. Dan Plishkin continued : "Several months later Howie gets a call from the person who bought this game. It had stopped collecting money and he wanted to know how to change the settings to make it play longer, or something, to see if it would earn more money. Howie had to tell the guy that if it ever collected any money at all, it was a miracle because it didn't have any coin routines at all. It had none, because we had wired it for free-play when we sent it to the AMOA show!".


* The Great 25-Cent Escape : Especially in the early 1980s a great many newspaper and magazine articles were written about the meaning of and possible consequences of the wave of video games that seemed to allure so many kids, and adults, to the arcades. But at the heart of it might have been the promise of a quick escape into another world. Rich Adam : "I kind of figured out, maybe years after the fact, what I think the lure of video games is. It's because people have so little control over their lives. This is especially true with kids, but even adults often have little control over the day-to-day part of their lives. You have to go to work. You don't get to control that much of your life. But for a quarter you can control this very complex machine. You can command it. For a quarter that's quite a bargain, to be able to do that for five minutes... When you're good at a game it gives you an incredible sense of power over the whole environment.".


Atari's second bestselling coin-op game. Approximately 55,000 units were produced. Centipede was the 1st UL (Underwriter's Laboratories) approved game.


Jim Schneider holds the official record for this game on 'Marathon' settings with 16,389,547 points on August 1, 1984.

Donald Hayes holds the official record for this game on 'Tournament' settings with 7,111,111 points on November 5, 2000.


Note : The upright side artwork features a grasshopper, while it is not present during game-play. In test mode you can cycle through the different graphical objects used in the game (the player, a mushroom, a spider, a scorpion, a flea and a grasshopper). Grasshopper?! Yes, the game was to originally have had grasshoppers but they were taken out. You can still see them in the test however.


Note 2 : 'Centipede' is also the name of a terrifying, man-eating monster of the size of a mountain. This Japanese legend say that the dragon king of that particular lake asked the famous hero Hidesato to kill it for him. The hero slew it by shooting an arrow, dipped in his own saliva, into the brain of the monster. The dragon king rewarded Hidesato by giving him a rice-bag; a bag of rice which could not be emptied and it fed his family for centuries.


Centipede inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Ode To A Centipede' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album.


A bootleg was released by Olympia under the same name. Another bootleg of this game is known as "Caterpillar".

A French hack of this game is known as "Mill Pac". An Italian hack is known as "Magic Worm".


The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including CENTIPED.


A Centipede unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1983 movie 'James Bond 007 - Never Say Never Again', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Body Double', in the 1985 movie 'Teen Wolf', in the 1986 movie 'Running Scared', in the 1987 movie 'Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown', in the 1995 movie 'Species' and in the 1996 movie 'House Arrest'.


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".


MB (Milton Bradley) released a boardgame based on Atari's Centipede.


- SCORING -


Mushrooms & Poisoned Mushrooms : 1 point (Takes 4 hits to destroy) : When the mushroom patch is reset after a player loses a life, each partially destroyed/poisoned mushroom that is restored awards the player 5 bonus points.

Centipede (Body) : 10 points

Centipede (Head) : 100 points

Flea : 200 points (Takes 2 hits. First hit speeds it up, second hit destroys it)

Spider : 300, 600, 900 points (Points increase the closer the Spider is to the Bug Blaster when hit)

Scorpion : 1000 points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, you will be put in the middle at the bottom of the screen. You have an area five mushrooms high (about a 5th of the playing area) to maneuver your Bug Blaster in. The game will start when the enemies enters the screen. Know your enemies! This is the single most important aspect of this game. If you don't know how each of the enemies behave, you won't last long. The enemies are :

1) Centipede (Body and Head) : Goes back and forth across the screen. Will drop to the next level when it encounters a mushroom or the side of the game field. It will go all the way to the bottom when it hits a poisoned mushroom.

2) Spider : These appear from the top left or right of the player area. They will either bounce across the player's area at 45 degree angles or bounce in at a 45 degree angle, bounce up and down a couple of times, go to the middle at a 45 degree angle, bounce up and down a couple of times, then finally go to the right side (at a 45 degree angle), bounce up and down, then exit the area. They destroy mushrooms they cross over.

3) Flea : These appear in wave 2. They will appear when you have cleared out most of the mushrooms in the player area. These never appear when you have an eleven segmented Centipede.

4) Scorpion : These appear in wave 3. They go across the screen and poison all the mushrooms in their path.


* The Centipede will start out as a head and eleven body segments on Wave 1. Wave 2 will be a head with ten body segments and a head that enters from the opposite side. Wave 3 will be a head with nine body segments and two heads that enter from opposite sides. This progression keeps going until wave 12 when all that enter the screen are heads. The progression then starts back up again in a never ending cycle.


* You must eliminate the Wave 1 Centipede only once. Then, until you score reaches 40,000 points, you must destroy each subsequent Centipede wave twice--first as the Centipede moves slowly towards you, then as it moves fast. After your score reaches 40,000 points, each Centipede will only need to be destroyed once.


* Shooting the Centipede can have 2 effects :

1) If you shoot the head, that part turns into a mushroom and the next segment becomes the new head and the Centipede will travel in the opposite direction (since it hit the new mushroom created).

2) If you shoot the middle of the body, then the segment hit will become a mushroom. The old Centipede will continue in the same direction. The new Centipede will develop a head at the next segment after the break and head off in the opposite direction.


* A good strategy to ensure you destroy the Centipedes in one stroke and to keep the Fleas at bay is to create 'mushroom corridors'. Mushroom corridors are basically corridors between two rows of mushrooms where you can funnel the Centipede down and destroy it when it is moving head-first at your Bug Blaster.


* A good defense against the Flea is to keep a certain amount of mushrooms on the screen. There is no hard set value but when the Fleas don't come down, you have enough. This number gets higher as your score increases.


* Speaking of score, Fleas start traveling faster after 60,000 points.


* Watch out for the Spiders. They enter at either the top or bottom corners. Your shooter may be in the way if this happens.  In addition to collisions, the Spiders wipe out all mushrooms that are in its path. This can create problems when you are creating mushroom corridors. It can also cause the Fleas to appear since you won't have many mushrooms in the player area.


* Keep track of where the Scorpions move across the screen. As soon as the Centipede hits a poisoned mushroom, it will immediately head for the bottom of the screen. The only way to stop this headlong plunge is to shoot it in the head. In the later waves, it is not uncommon to have multiple Scorpions going across the screen. They also provide the most points in the game.


* If you get unlucky and let the Centipede into your area, you need to destroy it before it gets to the bottom of the player area. Once it reaches the bottom, it will ascend (it will never reach the player area, though). If it does reach the bottom of the player area, another head will come out from the opposite side to start its back and forth march across the screen. This will continue until you destroy all the Centipede parts in the player area or until your Bug Blaster is destroyed.


* If your Bug Blaster gets destroyed, all partially shot up mushrooms are regenerated, all poisoned mushrooms are restored to normal, and you start at the beginning of the wave you got killed on.


* Depending on machine set up, all enemies (except the Centipede and Flea) speed up at the 1,000 or 5,000 point mark.


* Bottom Side Tunnels : To perform this trick, you must do the following...

1) When the Centipede is one row over the player's area (5th mushroom up), go to the opposite side that the Centipede is on.

2) When the Centipede turns around, it will be in the player's area. It then will make it to the side you are on. Right when it hits the side of the screen and turns around, shoot it. This creates a mushroom and forces the Centipede to turn around and go down one level.

3) Again, after the Centipede hits the wall, shoot it, create a mushroom, and force it down another level.

4) Continue to do this until you have only the bottom part left. There are two ways to do this :

a) If you get killed by the Centipede, this will also create a mushroom and you will have a vertical line of mushrooms along one of the side.

b) If you are quick, you can pick off the Centipede and create this last mushroom.

5) Repeat this for the other side.

6) Regardless of how you create this 'Side Tunnel', you will now have a trapped Centipede since the only thing it can do is go up and down within the player's area. New heads that come out will also be trapped.

7) Now you can pick off enemies at your leisure. The only enemy you need to make sure you take out is the Spider since it can wipe out part of your 'Side Tunnel'.

8) Good players consider this 'cheating' since it basically lets the player have free reign over the game.


* Central Tunnel : This trick works along the same line as the 'Bottom Side Tunnel' trick. The difference is that you create a tunnel down the center of the screen...

1) When the Centipede starts its descent, hit it. This will cause it to reverse direction after hitting the new mushroom.

2) After going one or two mushroom lengths, hit it. Again, this will cause it to reverse direction.

3) Continue to do this until you have built a 'tunnel' that touches the player's area.

4) Also make sure you build up mushrooms to the left and right of the tunnel to prevent the Fleas from coming down and depositing their random mushrooms.

5) From this point on, when the Centipede approaches your tunnel, all it will take is one hit to force it to descend. In a sense, you are causing the same effect that a Scorpion causes, but on your terms.

6) Since you are keeping the top left and right areas clear, it should take a longer time for the individual heads to make it to the player's area.

7) It will take a few waves to build up your areas. Once built up, you should be the master of the game.

8) As for the other tunnel, make sure you take care of the Spiders when they first enter so they don't do any damage to your 'Central Tunnel'.

9) Also make sure that you keep your tunnel cleared out by destroying any stray mushrooms within it.


* Fortress : If you are patient, you could build a mushroom fortress around your Bug Blaster. Then all you would do is shoot Spiders for the rest of the game.

* Notes :

The modernized 3-D remake of the game released for PC CD-ROM, Sony PlayStation, Sega Dreamcast, and Apple Macintosh refers to the player's Bug Blaster as "The Shooter", refers to the cast of enemies as the 'Legend', and follows this storyline : 


"The story begins every hundred years. It always begins in the same way, with a Legend awakening. Legend says that a multitude of armored beasts emerge from the dark core of the earth. They swarm to the surface, drawn by their master. Every hundred years they try to overtake our world and we always thing we've destroyed them. The Legend also has it that every hundred years, we're wrong!


When word came down that the Legend has come to life, we built The Shooter. But we needed a hero to fly it. This year the magic stick didn't point to the usual hero. It pointed to Wally Gudmunzsun. Now Wally wasn't one of the usual heroes. In fact, he wasn't a hero at all. He was just a simple bean counter. But when you're asked to save the world, you don't ask why. You just make it happen."

Challenger (c) 1981 GamePlan.


CHALLENGER is the newest video game to be introduced by Centuri. With its vivid colors and lively setting, it is sure to lure the most ardent player into game action.


The game consists of 16 sectors (rounds) of play. Sector 1 begins with Large Energy Rings floating randomly across the screen. The Spaceship must avoid colliding with the Rings, or it will explode into a starburst of brilliant colors. The Spaceship dodges the Energy Rings by moving right or left across the playfield, while bursting them with the Spaceship's 3-directional guns. Bursting the Large Rings (100 points) breaks them into Medium Rings. Bursting the Medium Rings (200 points) breaks them into Small Rings. Bursting the Small Rings (400 points) causes them to disintegrate.


The Spaceship is further protected by a feature called a 'Warp' button. By depressing this button, the Spaceship will relocate from the top or bottom of the screen to the opposite side.


If the Spaceship is in ultimate danger of being destroyed, releasing its Super Bomb will wipe out all the objects on the playfield, and add the point value of the objects to your score. Use of the Super Bomb is lost, if the ship is destroyed first. Only one Super Bomb is awarded per Spaceship.


At any time, a colorful Space Bogey resembling a Worm may appear on screen and proceed to chase the Spaceship. If the Worm is destroyed by Spaceship fire, or dodged successfully for several seconds, a 'clang' is heard and the Worm (500 points) wriggles off the screen in a bright red hue of embarrassment. If the Spaceship is caught by the Worm, a bell is sounded, and the astronaut is chased out of his ship in pursuit of safety.


At random time intervals a Bonus Bug will walk across the playfield, stop, and count down a Bonus Number. This number is equal to 100 times its value. To receive this Bonus, the Spaceship must link with the nose of the Bonus Bug.


When the Spaceship has survived 50 Seconds of playing time, it now enters the challenges of the next sector.


The remaining 15 sectors are played in the same manner as Sector one. The differences include that each succeeding sector increases in difficulty. The Energy Rings increase in number and move faster across the screen making them harder to dodge. Also there are several Space Bogeys introduced in the first 8 sectors. They also increase in number with advancement through each sector. Some of the Space Bogeys resemble Comets whizzing through space. Others resemble Spaceships from other worlds. Each Space Bogey (500 points), is an assemblage of bright colors, and when destroyed, burst with a "clang" into a spray of bright light.


Sectors 4, 8, 12, and 16, are alike as follows. A few seconds after the Energy Rings are broken into smaller pieces, they are pulled into a Black Hole in the center of the screen. While swirling across the game area, the condensed Rings expand and shatter into fragments which must be destroyed before they absorb the Spaceship.


When Sector 16 has been accomplished, it will return to Sector 9.


When Bonus levels are achieved, an additional Ship will be added to your game.


CHALLENGER INSTRUCTIONS

1. Burst energy rings to score and increase bonus levels.

Large rings - 100 points

Medium rings - 200 points

Small rings - 400 points

2. After all the small rings are hit, advance to the next sector.

3. In each sector, space bogeys appear and score 500 points when hit.

4. When the bonus bug walks across the playfield and stops, bonus points are counted down. To collect the bonus, link the ship with nose of the bug.

5. Pressing the warp button immediately relocates the ship from the top or bottom of the playfield to the opposite side.

6. The Super Bomb button destroys all objects on the playfield screen and awards total point value to your score.

7. One Super Bomb is awarded per ship.  Use of it will be lost if the ship is destroyed first.

8. Game is over when all the ships have been destroyed.

Championship Sprint (c) 1986 Atari Games.


Championship Sprint is an updated version of the old Atari Sprint series, with the added ability for players to upgrade their vehicles as the game progresses. Upgrades are won by collecting the bonus wrenches that appear once during each race, and once players have collected four wrenches, they will be presented with an upgrade screen; allowing them to choose better traction, top speed, acceleration, or a faster helicopter.


Collisions with barriers should, of course, be avoided, as they invariably cost the player valuable time. Also; a direct, head-on collision can cause the players' vehicles to explode - particularly if the player is moving at speed when this happens. In the event of a car exploding, a helicopter will automatically airlift a replacement vehicle to the track; this replacement will retain any previous upgrades made by the player. Waiting for the replacement car takes precious time and allows rival drivers to gain a distinct advantage. Car replacement time can be shortened upgrading the helicopter.


The tracks themselves are all variations on the basic 'oval', with gates, jumps, ramps and crossroads ensuring a demanding, yet incredibly playable game.

Clearing a square by walking over it : 10 points.

Collecting flags : 500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 points etc.

Defusing a bomb with 50-60 seconds remaining : 3,000 points.

Defusing a bomb with 40-49 seconds remaining : 2,500 points.

Defusing a bomb with 30-39 seconds remaining : 2,000 points.

Defusing a bomb with 20-29 seconds remaining : 1,500 points.

Defusing a bomb with 10-19 seconds remaining : 1,000 points.

Defusing a bomb with 1-9 seconds remaining : 500 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Collect all of the flags on the early levels as there is no great threat from the boots.


* Scroll bombs to the opposite edge of the screen so you can easily collect them and move back to your starting side.


* At the start of each level you get a few seconds where the boots can not move. Make use of this time to get to the first bomb.


* If two bombs are ticking down, get the closest one first unless the other is much closer to exploding.


* Move the floor away from boots to trap them.


* If you trap a boot on a single square, you can move the square away from underneath it, trapping it on empty space.

Atomic Runner Chelnov - Tatakau Ningen Hatsudensho (c) 1988 Data East.


A horizontally scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which the player controls Chelnov, a former coal miner caught up in a Chenobyl-like nuclear accident. Now possessing superior physical strength and agility, Chelnov is determined to escape the Eastern Bloc country he called home, and run and jump across the world to finish in the US.


What distinguishes this game from others of its genre is its use of forced scrolling. The screen moves continuously from left to right and players must negotiate the game's many obstacles and enemies without the benefit of dictating their speed of progress. Enemies attack from left, right, above and below and Chelnov can switch the direction he's facing to attack enemies that are behind him. Some enemies carry different types of weapons and power-ups and when they are shot the power-ups drop to the ground and can be picked up.

Chiller (c) 1986 Exidy.


This is a gun game, and there are four different screens (plus two different bonus screens). The object is simply to shoot everything in sight (and to try and locate any hidden targets on the screen). The game is based on time, and the timer moves faster when you are shooting poorly.

* The first screen is a torture chamber. There are four (still living) human targets on this screen. From left to right they are; a man chained to the wall, a person in a guillotine (shoot the top of the guillotine to decapitate them), a woman strapped in a strange machine, and a man in a head vise (shoot the vise to crush his head). The rest of the room is strewn with blood and loose body parts. You don't simply shoot each target once, instead you shoot each part of the target, which reduces that part to a mess of blood and bones. This is thankfully the most disturbing level in the game.

* The second room is another torture chamber with a river of blood flowing through the middle. This one has five human targets; a man strapped to a board, a man chained to the floor, two people on stretching racks (shoot the wheels to pull them apart), and a woman hung from rope over the river (shoot a pulley to slowly lower her into the river to be eaten by crocodiles). Body parts will flow down the river randomly, and a man will pop out of a door from time to time to toss a blade into one of the helpless victims.

* The third level is a haunted house hallway. There is only one human victim on this level. It is a woman who runs from one doorway to another, shoot out the trapdoor to cause her to fall inside (and then shoot the beast that was chasing her). Your other targets are mostly assorted ghosts, and a few random body parts that will fall from the ceiling.

* The final level is a graveyard. Your only human victim on this level is a woman who is half buried in the ground, shooting her torso multiple times strips off her clothing until she is topless, and the last shot kills her. You other targets are bats, hands that pop up from the ground, and a man who pulls a cart full of body parts (you can't kill him, shooting him just makes him run away, only to return later).


The game repeats the levels over and over again until you manage to find every secret target on each screen (it gives you hints inbetween levels). Finding all the targets on a single screen earns you a bonus game (a slot machine), while finding all the hidden targets in the game gives you the second bonus game (a shooting gallery), and a free game.

So you think blood and guts in video games is a phenomenon of the 90's? The main point of this game is to shoot helpless humans in the most gory manner possible. It is amazing that this game somehow slipped past the watchdogs back in 1986.


This game was available as either a dedicated cabinet or a a conversion kit for other Exidy gun games (which used the same cabinet anyway). The marquee had a green 'Chiller' logo on a purple nighttime background (it looks like the title screen to a cheap horror movie). The control panel overlay has similar graphics (and game instructions), along with pictures of various body parts. The game is controlled by a large optical gun that is fixed to the control panel where it can only fire into the machine. The monitor itself was hidden deep inside the machine, the gameplay was displayed on a mirror.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Master the jump : Learning how Charlie can jump is the first step to mastering this game.


* Move forward and backward to adjust your position : If you just keep moving forward, there could be an obstacle at where you land after your jump. In such cases, move back a bit to adjust your position.


* Tons of secrets : There are a bunch of secrets bonuses hidden in this game.


1) Fire rings : Jump through a ring from your back first or jump 3 times at the starting point. Then a Charlie doll will appear from the front hanging. Catch it and get an extra player!


2) Fire rings : Jump over a pot from your back first and a coin may appear from the pot. Catch it to obtain bonus points. However, it happens only once per level. From which pot the coin may appear is determined randomly.


3) Fire rings : If you get to the goal after getting all dollar bags, a hawk brings a dollar bag and you obtain bonus points. This happens only if you have made no misses in that level.


4) Tightrope : If you jump over the brown and purple monkeys at once, you get a 1,000-point bonus.


5) Tightrope : If you perform perpendicular jumps over all monkeys and complete the level, a hawk will bring a Charlie doll and you get an extra player.


6) Tightrope : Jump over the purple monkey from your back first and you get a 5,000-point bonus.


7) Tightrope : Touch the hook beyond the goal and a dollar back appears. Reach the goal and you get a 5,000-points bonus.


8) Trampoline : Get all dollar bags and reach the goal. A hawk will bring a dollar bag and you earn bonus points.


9) Acrobatic jump : Use the spring only once after jumping off the horse and get to the goal. A hawk will bring a Charlie doll and you get an extra player.


10) Trapeze : Grab onto a trapeze by skipping one and get bonus points.


11) Trapeze : Bounce off a trampoline and then grap onto a trapeze to get bonus points.

POP! POP! POP! Pop the balloons and score points. A wall of yellow, green and blue balloons will appear at the top of the screen. You must pop balloons by catching a clown on the teeter-totter and bouncing him up to the balloons.


- TECHNICAL -


Circus came in an upright dedicated cabinet, and may have also been available in a cocktail configuration as well. Circus machines had white sides with red painted sideart of several balloons in flight. The front of the machine was decorated with a large ornate monitor bezel that also doubled as a marquee (or nameplate), this bezel showed several clowns in a circus scene and had the game title spelled out with multicolored balloons. The control panel was unadorned, save for an analog spinner and a start button. The whole machine was finished off in black t-molding. Once inside the machine, you can see that it uses a black and white monitor with a colored overlay (to make the balloons have color).

This explains the hearts after losing a life and the girl that appears every time you beat a level. Clarice's name appears at the bottom of the High score rankings.

Clay Pigeon (c) 1986 Exidy.


The object of Clay Pigeon was to shoot as many clay targets as you can, using an arcade light gun that was shaped like a shotgun. At the start of the game you are given the choice of selecting either Trap Shooting or Skeet Shooting. Trap shooting is where the clay target is thrown directly away from the shooter, while in skeet shooting the target is launched across the shooter's field of vision. The graphics are done in Exidy's realistic style, each round is played against a decent looking outdoor background, and an extremely repetitive announcer yells 'pull' to warn you of each and every target being launched. After several rounds of targets, you finally get to go after some real live animals! The real live animals are of course, ducks! The ducks are small and fly onto the screen in small groups of up to around a half dozen or so, and unlike the earlier title "Vs. Duck Hunt", you cannot miss any of these. Missing any ducks in this round ends the game instantly, and will more than likely have you fumbling for another quarter in an attempt to do it right this time.

This title was available as either a conversion kit for Exidy's earlier gun titles, or as a dedicated cabinet. The game came in a big heavy black cabinet with the gun mounted on a huge control panel, all of the Exidy gun games used this cabinet, the only differences were the artwork, and the kind of gun. There were at least two different marquees on this title, the first one had a large 'Clay Pigeon' logo on a blue background, while the other had a small logo and a picture of a fence in a grassy field.

Cloak & Dagger (c) 1983 Atari.


Agent X, complete with trenchcoat, Bogie hat, and briefcase, hurries through a series of adventures and misadventures to retrieve stolen plans and destroy dastardly Dr. Boom's subterranean bomb factory. Our masked hero descends to the depths of Dr. Boom's laboratory in a special elevator. On each floor he encounters a series of conveyor belts that are moving explosives. A giant bomb ticks down the game seconds while devices of Dr. Boom's plotting, such as bomb converters, forklifts deflecting shots back at Agent X, robot guards, acid pits, and crawling eyes shooting death rays, challenge the player(s).


CLOAK & DAGGER is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster video display. You control Agent X as he descends underground floor by floor in an elevator to Dr. Boom's lab, located on the 33rd floor. Your main goal is to retrieve Top Secret plans that are surrounded by an electrical arc. To stop the electrical current, Agent X must shoot all the fiery nodes as he fights off robot guards.


As Agent X leaves the elevator on each floor, he must make his way carefully and quickly across the screen to another exit. Each floor displays a configuration of conveyor belts moving green unarmed and red armed explosives.  Agent X can pick up the green explosives. The red explosives will explode on contact. Some floors have marauding robot guards, death-ray shooting crawling eyes, and acid pits.


Once Agent X has the top secret plans in hand, he must make his way back to the surface. If he exits on a floor that was bombed on the way down, he will find a massive crater protected by node monsters and the previously mentioned attackers. If he exits on a floor that was not bombed, a superguard will join the other attackers to challenge Agent X. On the final level, rumors are that he will meet the notorious Dr. Boom himself.


At the center of the display, a double-coiled fuse to a giant bomb is ticking down the game seconds for each level. Agent X can light the fuse in a rush for bonus points, but must be able to escape that level before the bomb explodes. If the fuse has shortened on its own to one coil, it lights automatically and prompts Agent X to make a mad dash to the waiting elevator. The doors close just as a burst of light from the explosion is seen. The game's perspective now changes to a full view inside the elevator. Messages flash across the elevator to give helpful hints on the next level.


Dr. Boom has placed explosive mines on every 4th floor. On each of the preceding 3 floors Agent X can pick up a secret map box that will show him part of the safe path across the minefield on the next 4th floor.


Agent X's first goal is to travel successfully from one elevator to the other; his second goal is to pick up a secret box to get a map of the minefield on levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32; the third goal is to light the bomb fuse and escape before the explosion.


As game play progresses, Agent X may find an extra-life box and a mystery box that give bonus points, double speed, half speed, and occasionally, an extra life. Extra bonus points are earned for picking up green unarmed explosives or for skipping floors.


If Agent X succeeds in capturing the top secret plans, he must fight his way back up to the top level. The appearance of box compressors, crawling eyes, and other enemies are more random on the way up than on the way down. If Agent X makes it back to the surface, a free game will be awarded (depending on the settings of the option switches).


The game ends when you use up your last life or successfully make it to the surface.

Released in December 1983.


A Cloak & Dagger unit appears in the 1984 movie 'Cloak and Dagger'.


This game was in development independently from the movie of the same name under the title "Agent X". When the game was about 70% completed and the movie was about 40% done, the movie producers and editors came to Atari to see if Atari had a game they could film as backdrop to the movie scenes which needed a 'Cloak & Dagger like spy game'. Atari agreed to change the name of its game to 'Cloak & Dagger' and they put a couple of tid-bits into their script which referred to 'Agent X' (Dabny Colman's character). The game actually arrived on the scene about 2 months before the movie was released. It was tested under the name 'Agent X' in it's initial field test (about 5 months before the movie was released), but was never produced as anything but 'Cloak & Dagger'. There were about 5000 games produced which made it into the market place.


John McAllister holds the official record for this game with 1,497,744 points on April 1, 2009.

Astro Combat (c) 1979 Unknown.


Astro Combat is a 2-Dimensional, space shooter style game. Your job is to protect the various sectors from the hoards of invading aliens. You will have to defeat four waves of alien spaceships in order to dock with the 'GS' ship and refuel. In addition to battling the alien spaceships, you will also have to dodge bombs that seem to come out of nowhere. Armed only with your fighter and a lot of spirit, you must ensure that you clear the screen of invaders before they pass you by. All in all, another walk in the park.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your fighter will be in the middle at the bottom of the screen. The alien spaceships have two ways they shoot at your fighter. They either shoot straight down or they shoot diagonally. You must take out all the alien spaceships on a screen. If you fail to do so, you will have to deal with their full complement again and your fighter will be set at the next higher level. If you happen to get killed during a wave, you only have to deal with the remaining alien spaceships.


* Fuel is a precious commodity in this game. You may be able to let one or two waves of aliens escape but you will really be pressed to finish the entire round with enough fuel. If your fuel runs out, your game is over regardless of how many fighters you have left.


* You can only have one shot on the screen at a time. This means you will need to plan your shots and don't fire unless you need to.


* The first four waves of alien spaceships, with 15 alien spaceships per wave, come down in distinct formations. Understanding how these formations are set up is the key to taking them out quickly.

1) The Blue Aliens come down in a 'pyramid-type' formation. Starting from the bottom, the numbers are five at the bottom, four at the next level, three at the next level, two at the next level, and one at the top.

2) The Purple Aliens come down in two straight lines. With seven in the bottom line and eight in the top line.

3) The Green Aliens come down in a haphazard-type formation. They move back and forth across the screen and they are the hardest spaceships to deal with.

4) The Yellow Aliens come down in three rows with five spaceships per row.


* As you shoot the alien formations, you will notice that the remaining alien spaceships will speed up. The key is to shoot them high up on the screen so that you are not desperately trying to take out the last ones at the bottom. This also means taking out the bottom attackers first to give yourself some 'breathing' room.


* In addition to the alien spaceships, you must be wary of the bombs that drop down. When you are lining up your shots at the alien spaceships, always be aware of where the bombs may be heading and act accordingly.


* On the fifth wave, you will have to deal with the 'GS' ship. Its shots are pretty easy to avoid and it must be hit dead center to stop it, collect the points, and refuel your fighter for the next round.

Combat School (c) 05/1987 Konami.


A one or two player multi-event combat game, similar in gameplay style to Konami's "Track and Field" series. 

* In the obstacle course, you must repeatedly press the fire button to run as fast as possible. Press the jump button in order to clear or mount hurdles of various hights. Complete the course within a specific ammount of time to continue the game.

* In the Iron Man race, the controls are the same but you will jump puddles and boulders and swim across a stream. 

* In the firing ranges, aim with the joystick or trackball and shoot using the fire button. There will be various firing range sessions beginning with stationary targets, preceeding to moving targets, and finishing with having to avoid hitting the targets that represent comrades. The comrade targets resemble your drill instructor but you must still avoid hitting them (the wrong targets and the drill instructors) as it will cost you the game. The activities get progressively more difficult as you proceed.

Released in May 1985.

Licensed to Data East for US manufacture and distribution (July 1985). Commando was the first (and the only) game that Capcom licensed to Data East.


This game is known in Japan as "Senjou no Ookami" (translates as 'Battlefield of the Wolf') and is known as "Space Invasion" for the West German marketplace.


The main character is Super Joe from "Bionic Commando" and "The Speed Rumbler".


Tim Balderramos holds the official record for this game with 10,051,200 points on July 5, 1986.


Bandai released a boardgame based on this video game (same name) : A simple roll-and-move type game, with symbols on the board indicating what happens when you land on that spot. There are multiple choices on which direction to go, but not too much in the way of required thinking. There are many different boards that you progress through, each 'board' representing one 'stage' of the game.


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Capcom Game Music - 28XA-94) on 25/08/1986.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* The arch bridge is a dangerous spot so watch for grenade attacks from above. Be careful of trucks and jeeps that may try to run over you. Do not fall into rivers or ponds. Trees, walls and other obstacles may be used for cover.


* Here's a good way to kill enemy soldiers without going anywhere near them : at the end of each area, when the enemy soldiers are pouring out of the gate from their compound, move your commando to the bottom of the screen and shoot down. Your shots will come down from the top of the screen, killing the soldiers as they come out of the gate.


* This tip will let you rack up big points and all the extra men you can : on the first stage, there is a cliff on the right-hand side of the screen. The enemy troops will jump off the end of this cliff and attack you. If you walk until the enemy troops START jumping off, and then stop, you can just stand there and keep killing them until you either get sick of playing or reach the maximum amount of extra men the game allows. If you plan on playing through the rest of the game you should stop as soon as you reach the maximum amount of extra men, as the longer you just sit there, the harder and faster the enemies become, making the rest of the game substantially more difficult.

Comotion (c) 10/1976 Gremlin.


This game was for two or four players only, you must have a live human opponent to play against, or else the other players character will go straight into a wall, making for a very quick and boring game. Each player moves their character around leaving a solid line behind them. All moves are made on an invisible grid, so you can only turn at 90 degree angles. To win you must last longer than your opponents before hitting something. Each player is eliminated when they crash, taking their lines with them. One good strategy is to turn around and head for the outer area of the screen (in four player mode), because everyone starts out headed for the center. Skirt around the edges until you only have one opponent left, then box them in. Pushing backwards on the stick will cause you to crash into your own line, so avoid that at all cost.

This game came in only one form factor, that of the standup cocktail (a format that was really only used in the 70s). The machine was a round table about 4 feet tall. The table top was wood grained, and it had four sets of player controls spaced evenly around the table. The monitor was located inside the table facing upwards. This game had simple sideart that consisted of a few stripes and a 'Comotion' logo (the logo snaked around much like the games characters did). The game featured control panels that were devoid of joysticks, instead you controlled the game using a button for each direction. Two people could play for twenty five cents, or four people could play for fifty cents. The prices were hard coded into the games romset, so operators really couldn't mess with them (the games title screen clearly said "'25 cents for two players, 50 cents for four players').

Congo Bongo (c) 1983 Sega.


Jungle drums pound as CONGO BONGO, the cartoon adventure that pits man against monkey, takes you on the craziest, most action-packed safari ever! With fantastic 3-D-like graphics and wonderful native sounds, SEGA's CONGO BONGO lures explorers of all ages to chase Bongo, the mischievous gorilla, through four vivid scenes of jungle fun. By use of an 8-way joystick and a jump button, the player maneuvers his hunter through the various scenes and avoids obstacles and dangers in his path.


In the 1st scene, Bongo roars defiantly from the top of Steep Peak as the hunter approaches. The hunter must climb the treacherous cliffside to reach the bridge above, while avoiding the bouncing coconuts Bongo throws down. Once across the bridge, the hunter must slide down a slope and knock the green monkey off the ledge. Green monkeys will block the hunter's path and if not pushed over a cliff or jumped over, the hunter cannot pass.


Next the hunter must jump over a perilous, collapsing chasm and climb the cliff to Primate Plateau. Here several friendly-looking monkeys scamper about playfully. Be careful though, as the cheerful chimps will cling to the hunter, slowing him down. By using the jump button, the player can shake the chimps off the hunter, but it must be done quickly, because if three chimps grab the hunter, they will pick the hunter up and throw him over the side and into the river. Once past the monkeys, the hunter must jump the river again and climb up to the top where a chagrined Bongo loses his smile and runs off into the jungle.


In the 2nd scene, Bongo taunts the hunter from across Snake Lake. Immediately scorpions descend upon the hunter and he must decide which route to take quickly. Snake Lake is a maze of bridges and islands with snakes guarding every route. The hunter must avoid the snakes by jumping over them. The hunter should attempt to reach the island nearest Bongo and jump onto the back of the hippo and then safely to shore. Beware of the hippo as he dives and surfaces. Once safely to shore, Bongo gets worried and scampers off again.


The 3rd scene opens with the hunter in a mole hole on Rhino Ridge. A herd of charging rhinos must be avoided in the hunter's attempt to capture Bongo. The hunter can avoid the rhinos by jumping over them or ducking into a mole hole. When ducking into a mole hole, the player must depress the jump button for the hunter to duck down and avoid the rhinos.


In the 4th scene, a weary Bongo naps in a chair on the far side of Lazy Lagoon. To reach Bongo, the hunter must cross Lazy Lagoon by jumping on lily pads, hippos and fish that might sink at any minute. Once across Lazy Lagoon, the hunter must dodge the last charging rhinos and climb the last bluff to capture Bongo. After Bongo is captured, the scenes repeat with increasing difficulty.


CONGO BONGO is a 1 or 2 player game with players alternating at the loss of each hunter. Each scene is timed by the bonus counter in the upper left corner of the screen. As time passes, the bonus decreases. If the bonus counter reaches zero, the player loses that hunter, the bonus counter is reset and play continues if he has other hunters available. Game ends with the loss of the last hunter.

Contra (c) 1987 Konami.


In 2631, a meteorite strikes the Galuga archipelago near New Zealand, carrying with it a dormant alien lifeform. Two years later in 2633, a terrorist organization of alien origin called Red Falcon takes over the island as part of their plot to invade the Earth. Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, of the Contra unit, are sent to the Oceania island to stop the evil threat.


Contra is a hectic one or two player platform shoot-em-up featuring 5 stages. 3 of the levels are standard side-scrolling platform levels, while the remaining two are enemy 'bases'; 3rd person into-the-screen stages in which players must run down series of heavily defended corridors to reach and destroy an end-of-level boss, before moving onto the next stage.


Each player's character is equipped with a semi-automatic machine gun with an unlimited amount of ammunition and can jump, move and fire in all eight cardinal directions. Players can also move and jump simultaneously while firing. Co-ordination of the character's movement is essential as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player's character and also eliminate the current weapon from the player's inventory.


As players fight their way through the enemy-packed levels, additional weapons can be collected. If the player loses a life, they will also lose any weapon power-up they were carrying. Available weapons are :

Machine gun [M] : Auto-fire.

Spread gun [S] : Allows the player to fire 5 shots in an arc.

Laser gun [L] : Will shoot a long laser that can take out many enemies in a row.

Fire Ball [F] : A gun which fires small fireballs in a corkscrew pattern.

Rapid-fire [R] : Increases the firing rate of the player's currently equipped weapon. Works with all weapons except the Laser.

Barrier [B] : Will make the player invincible for a few seconds.


The game's 5 levels and bosses are as follows :

Stage 1 : Jungle - Defensive Wall - (horizontal scrolling)

Stage 2 : Base 01 - Six turrets and alien eyeball - (third-person)

Stage 3 : Waterfall - Large Alien - (vertical scrolling)

Stage 4 : Base 02 - Six turrets and alien head - (third-person)

Stage 5 : Snow Field/Energy Zone/Hangar/Alien Lair - Alien Heart - (horizontal scrolling)

Released in February 1987.


This game is known in Europe as "Gryzor".


Note : The kanji on the Japanese version title screen actually reads 'Kon To Ra', meaning 'Soul Big Dipper Gauze'. This is an example of 'ateji', in which Japanese artists use the phonetic value of a character to fit the game's name, allowing them to write the name in kanji as opposed to a kana.


Here are the official names of the characters : Bill Rizer (player 1) and Lance Bean (player 2).


Bill Rizer makes an appearance as a supporting character in the 1992 Nintendo NES/Famicom game "Wai Wai World 2 SOS!! - Paseri Jou" (A.K.A. "Konami World 2 - SOS from Parsley Castle").


The music from the final stage is also used for the final boss confrontation in "Wai Wai World" (A.K.A. "Konami World" ) for the Nintendo NES/Famicom.


Chad Johnson holds the official record for this game with 1, 546, 600 points on July 15, 2002.


Alpha Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Vol.4 - 28XA-201) on 10/03/1988.


- UPDATES -


The game's backstory differs between sources. The storyline written above is the one used by Japanese sources and later mentioned in canon in Contra: Shattered Soldier for the PlayStation 2. In the North American manual for the NES version, the time was changed from the 27th century to the present day, with the location moved from Galuga to an unnamed South American island. Bill and Lance were given the codenames "Mad Dog" and "Scorpion", names which were later used for 2 unrelated characters in the American-produced Contra 4 for the Nintendo DS.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Use shots wisely : Jump shots and crouch shots allow you to attack while avoiding enemy attacks. Do not hesitate. Keep those shots going!


* Kill before being killed : if you see an enemy, shoot right away. Defeat them before they fire at you. Be the first one to attack!


* Tip for taking down the fortress : Fortresses situated at the end of eah levl have a weak point (sensor). Concentrate your attack on the weak point!

But Destroy the cannons first. Cannons will remain even if you take out the sensor first and the fortress morphs.


* Tip for 3-D levels : Destroy the weak points of each floor and stop the high voltage electric currents. Taking out the weak points quickly is key to conquerins the 3-D levels.

If you press UP on the control pad and touch th electricity, you will be stunned and won't be able to mov for a while. Don't move forward until you take out the weak point and stop the electricity.

After you take out the weak point, look at the map while proceeding. You'll know whether to go left or right.

You can dodge enemy bullets by lying down! Destroy rolling mines by using crouch shots.

As you proceed, there are weak points that are positioned so that you can't reach them. Utilize jump shots and crouch shots.


* Beware of Falling off at Stage 4 : In Stage 4 where you climb up a waterfall, missing a platform and falling down will count as a miss.


* Barrier : At specfic spots in Stages 4 & 9, you can pick up barriers that make you invincible for a while. However, there is a rule : 'A barrier will appear only when you are NOT equipped with a special weapong'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* 'Mad Dash' : J.D. Lowe, the current world record holder adds some suggestions... Something that very few players use is something I call 'Mad Dash'. If you watch as the chef is drawn on the screen, he walks up/down ladders at approx. 8 steps a second. So, in theory, if you can press the up and down arrows faster than 8 times a second, you can go faster. This is very helpful on later levels like Level 20. This does not work on going left and right, because the steps are smaller, and the computer has to draw the chef facing you again if you let go of the controller. It's a bit complicated, but like I said earlier, it can be very helpful.


* Peppers Appearances : the peppers do not appear randomly on the screen; in fact, they appear after so many ingredients have fallen to the bottom of the screen...

Level 1 - Peppers appear after 4, 8, and 12 ingredients have dropped.

Level 2 - After 3, 6, and 9 ingredients.

Level 3 - 5, 7, and 13.

Level 4 - 4, 8, and 13.

Level 5 - 6, 16, 22, 29.

Level 6 - 3, 7, 12, 14.


* Hint 1 : enemies can't turn around immediately, so you can follow them around temporarily.


* Hint 2 : the best tactic is generally to stand halfway across a piece of food, wait for enemies to appear on the food's edge, and then drop the food and enemies at once. Always lure the enemies onto the highest portion of the screen, and then drop them. This has several advantages : it clears more burger pieces, plus it means that units on lower levels may wander into the cascading pieces, killing them also.


* Hint 3 : leave LOTS of room around yourself when going up ladders - the sprites in Burger Time are somewhat bigger than the visible characters.


* Hint 4 : when enemies first appear, you have 1/4 sec to go through them, if you need to.


* IMPORTANT : if you get caught while the last piece of food is falling into place, the game will NOT deduct a life from your game!

Cops'n Robbers (c) 1976 Atari.


From 1 to 4 people can play at once, with the computer adding in a player as needed to keep the number of players at either 2 or 4. Players number 1 and 2 play the part of the cops, while players 3 and 4 are the robbers.


The screen is an overhead view of a city street, with the cops on one side, and the robbers on the other. Each car is in it's own lane, and an extra wide lane marks the area between the cop and robber side. Each player can move up and down in their own lane, the object is to shoot down the cars of the opposite side. A beer truck moves randomly up and down the center lane, generally getting in the way.


- TECHNICAL -


This game was sold in an upright format only. The machine was rather unique looking as it was about twice the width of a standard arcade game, but all the other dimensions were normal (kind of like they just stuck two machines together). Later four player games would instead use a control panel that was wider than the screen. The bulk of the machine was white, with the front being painted black for durability. Classic 'Gangster' cars from the 30's filled out the sideart. There were 2 distinct monitor bezels, each with its own art. The outer one was decorated with several of the 'Gangster' cars, and a design that looks similar to a stylized Japanese sunset. The inner monitor bezel had a street scene that was meant to extend the scene that appeared on the monitor itself (and to help fill in that 4 foot wide playing area). The monitor also had a color overlay to give different colors to the different sides of the game (it used a black and white monitor). The joystick was a special design. It only has an up down axis, but has seven different positions on that axis, which makes for pseudo-analog action.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Alien UFO's can be destroyed by missiles or by contact with another UFO.


* Maximise your score on the tank stage by moving as slowly as possible. Tanks will appear as fast as you can fire. Remember to destroy any missiles fired by the tanks.


* Bomb diagonal missile launchers when they are below you, before they have a chance to launch.


* Vertical missiles are fired before you reach them. Slow down and allow them to fire, then destroy the launcher before it reloads.


* Destroy launchers situated on towers by firing missiles at them. This will clear the way for you well in advance.


* Watch the scanner for any UFO's coming from behind to see if they are coming in low or high. This will enable you to avoid them, but watch out for bullets.


* On the underwater stage destroy the mines so that alien subs are blown up in the subsequent explosion.


* You can move above enemy subs and bomb them safely as they only fire horizontally. Watch out for depth charges falling from above though.


o Don't miss the alien smart bombs as these clear a good few buildings in advance as well as awarding points.

Cosmic Chasm (c) 1983 Cinematronics.


Strap on your vector spacesuit, and hop into your vector spaceship. It is a good old ship, and it has seen a lot of action. From navigating the asteroid belt and blasting aliens around the sun, to attacking evil space cannons, your little vector ship has done it all, and this time it has been upgraded with twin blasters. You see the ship in Cosmic Chasm seems to be the same spaceship that is in every vector game. You control it using rotation buttons and a thruster button, with a laser and a shield button thrown in for good measure, just like almost every other vector game around.


Now here is what you have to do. You guide your ship through a space fortress room by room. Each room contains a center section that slowly grows and will eventually trap you if you are not fast enough. You can shoot the center section to slow its growth. Each room also contains several exits. One of the exits will always spew forth a bunch of bad guys, shoot them, then exit to go to a different room. Between rooms you get to see an excellent tunnel animation. The idea is to make your way to the center of the fortress, blast the power core, and then leave. There is a map at the top of the screen to keep you from getting lost. This is a pretty decent game. It has a lot more to offer than the one screen of bad guys that most vector games have.

- TRIVIA -


This game was the last color vector game released by Cinematronics. Approximately 400 units were produced (based on serial numbers). This title used a 68000 processor and a color X-Y monitor, which allowed for some very nice graphical effects that most early 80s hardware was simply not capable of.


This title was first available in 1982 on the CGE Vectrex home vector console, and was only available in the arcades later, in February 1983. That is quite a reverse from the norm, usually games hit the arcades a year or two before they make it to the consoles.


People often mistake Cosmic Chasm machines for converted "Dragon's Lair" machines. That is because they shipped in almost the exact same cabinet. They both have the same side panels, overall design, and three-section marquee. But Cosmic Chasm differs in the angle of the control panel, and in the placement of the monitor. The artwork on this machine is mostly purple. The sideart is done with two large stickers, and it shows a huge logo, and a scene of some giant girders out in space.

Cosmic Guerilla (c) 1979 Universal.


For some reason you have 2 of your ships placed in the middle of the playing field and aliens all around them. Luckily, they're protected by 5 rows of barriers and you're on the bottom, doing your job to protect them.


- TECHNICAL -


This game had great cabinet artwork, a white base, with purple, yellow and black overlaid artwork. It shows a horned demon and lots of swirls. Most interestingly, this has to be the only game to have a politically incorrect slogan plastered on the side -- SUPER VIOLENCE!. The artwork on the sides (and front) was varnished or lacquered, which gives it a shiny and incredibly strong coat, protecting it from scratches and any kind of fading! The control panel had backlit 1- and 2-player info panels. Insert one coin, '1 player' lit up; insert two and '2 player' lit up. This looks real nice on the brushed chrome control panel.

If you don't destroy the saucer that flies on top of the screen, it lowers itself and drops a new layer of invaders for you to shoot. This layer covers the whole space (instead of what's left over), so you're forced to shoot across the whole screen again.

Dots : 10 pts X number of cars on field.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Always be aware of where the Jam Car(s) is/are located. They can make up to two lane changes at a time, and that lane change may be into your lane.


* The faster you go, the fewer lanes you can cross. At full acceleration, you will only be able to change one lane at a time. Decelerate (take your finger off the accelerate button) to go across multiple lanes.


* The Jam Car(s) always travel in a clockwise motion while you travel in a counterclockwise motion. Remember that so that you don't get confused when there are multiple cars in the maze.


* Don't try to get all the dots on one of the lanes. You need to anticipate where your next move is well before you enter the lane change area since you cannot change lanes at any other time.  Sometimes, on the earlier levels, it is best to do a staggered type dot pickup where you do lane one, change to lane two, to lane three, lane four, lane five, then back to lane one. If you time it right, the Jam Car or Cars will still be in the maze.


* Don't let the speed of the Jam Car(s) throw you. Just plan to be out of your lane and in the lane change area before them. If both cars enter at the same time, you run a big risk of a collision.

Crazy Climber (c) 1980 Nichibutsu.


Crazy Climber is a 2-D, strategy style game. The game is strategic in the fact that you must plan your moves as you climb up the building and anticipate the hazards that await you. You start out the game at the bottom of a building to be scaled. As you climb up the building, you will be assailed by bald people throwing flowerpots, signs with loose electrical wires, very large apes, falling signs, trash and barbells, and a bird that likes to drop bad things on your character. Your goal is to make it to the top of the building and catch the helicopter, which will transport you to the next building to be scaled. Of course, you will be rewarded for quickly making it up the building by getting a bonus (that is as long as you can catch the helicopter). The things one does for publicity.


- TECHNICAL -


The game was released in several different cabinet styles. Taito licensed the game from Nichibutsu and released it in the US in a generic orange 'Taito' cabinet with Americanized artwork. A cabaret version of the game was also created.

Nichibutsu's standard cabinet was shaped similar to the Taito cabinet, but it had a plain white exterior with the Crazy Climber logo from the marquee on the kickplate and diagonally on the sides. The marquee and monitor bezel art are very vibrant, using many custom flourescent colors. The control panel is black painted metal with artwork painted on in orange, white and red. The marquee had no backlighting.

Nichibutsu's deluxe cabinet was taller and had a very unusual control panel. The panel attached to the front of the cabinet seperately and was metal covered with a curved piece of plexiglass. Full color artwork of the climber scaling the outside of a building is silkscreened onto the curved plexi. The instruction sheet was moved from its position on the standard cabinet's monitor bezel to a window on the control panel. The deluxe cabinet also used several Nintendo parts, including the same type monitor (Sanyo 20EZ) and the same style of coin mechs used by games like "Donkey Kong", "Donkey Kong Junior", et. al.

Released in October 1980. Crazy Climber was Fujiwara's first game.


The names of each building to climb in the game are 'Nichibutsu', 'Nichibutsu Leisure', 'Nichibutsu U.K. Ltd.' and 'Nichibutsu U.S.A Corp.'.


Some of the musical themes used in the game are 'Baby Elephant Walk', 'The Pink Panther Theme' and 'The Entertainer'.


Jim Wright holds the official record for this game with 487,150 points on July 5, 1982 with three starting lives.

Jason Cram holds the official record for this game with 301, 950 points on November 21, 2003 with four starting lives.


A Crazy Climber unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Rocky III'.


Bandai released a boardgame based on this videogame (same name) : This game has you playing cards to move to the top of a building. Like in the arcade, there is the peril that people seem to drop just about anything out their windows at random times. Each card allows you to move to a particular postion relative to where you currently are (for example, a chocie of straight up two squares or up two squares and left or right one). However, there must be an open window that is not occupied by another player for it to be a legal move. Whenever a player passes certain checkpoints, the spinner is spun to see if anything falls from the windows. If you're hit on the head, you drop down to the next open window. There is also a gorilla that knocks you all the way down if you're unfortunate enough to be hit by him. First one to get to the top of the building and escape on the helicopter wins.


- SCORING -


Each building has a STEP POINT heading. This indicates how many points you get for each window you successfully climb to. You also start out with a certain amount of bonus points per building. On buildings one and two, they decrease by 100 about every 2 seconds while on buildings three and four they decrease by 200 points about every 2 seconds. Below are listed the STEP POINT and BONUS

RATE points :

Building 1 - Step Point : 100 - Bonus Rate : 10000

Building 2 - Step Point : 150 - Bonus Rate : 20000

Building 3 - Step Point : 200 - Bonus Rate : 30000

Building 4 - Step Point : 250 - Bonus Rate : 40000


NOTE : You will only collect the remaining BONUS RATE if you successfully grab the helicopter at the top of the building. If you fail to grab the helicopter after it has made two passes, you get a consolation bonus of 3000 points regardless of what the BONUS RATE remaining is.


The balloon shows up during buildings two and three. You don't get points, perse, for grabbing the balloon. Instead, your character will get lifted up approximately ten stories and avoiding any hazards they may contain. You will get STEP POINTS for these bypassed stories as if you had actually climbed them. In addition, it will give you a bigger bonus since it is quicker going up the building like this.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your climber will climb a couple of steps. Then it will be up to you to guide him to the top of the building. The hardest aspect of this game is developing a rhythm with the controls to enable your climber to climb smoothly. This is something that takes practice. Fortunately, once you've developed this rhythm, the game is much easier to play. The basic rhythm is :

1) From the bottom ledge, reach up to the next ledge (left or right joystick).

2) Once you've got a hold on the next ledge, pull back on the joystick to bring your climber to the next ledge.

3) Use the opposite joystick to reach for the next ledge. Then pull yourself up.

4) Continue this rhythm for fast, straight climbs.

5) This also works for climbing diagonally. Instead of reaching for the ledge above, reach for the upper right or left ledge diagonal from your climber.


* You can move your climber from side to side just by pushing both joysticks to the right or left. As long as windows are open along your path, you can execute this move. Good for avoiding objects dropping on you such as signs and garbage.


* All the buildings have the following hazards :

1) Windows opening and closing : You cannot climb on a ledge if the window is closed. On building 1, they open and close slowly while on building 4, they open and close quickly.

2) Bald people throwing flowerpots out the windows : You cannot climb on a ledge if a person is in the window. Also, if a flowerpot hits your climber, you will get one hand knocked off the ledge. If you were only holding on by one hand, your climber falls.

3) A pesky bird flies over dropping nifty things on your climber (only building 3 doesn't have this bird) : Again, not much trouble if you are holding onto a ledge with both hands.


* If you are holding onto a ledge with both hands and the window closes, your climber will fall. This is why you need to either quickly move up the building or learn how to move diagonally to avoid the window hazards. In addition, you will have to move diagonally when the building configuration is 4-2.


* BUILDING 1 : Besides the above hazards, there is only one other hazard to deal with...

1) The bird shows up when the building configuration goes from a 6-2-2 to a 6 for the second time.

2) People will drop flowerpots on you when the building goes from 6-2-2 for the first time to 6-2-2 the second time.

3) King Kong will be at the point where the building goes to 6-2 the second time. To get by Kong, just go up the windows on the opposite side Kong is on.


* BUILDING 2 : The usual hazards exist along with another new one.

1) The bird shows up when the building configuration goes from 6-4 the second time to the middle of the 4 configuration.

2) People drop flowerpots when the building goes to 2 until it goes to 2-4.

3) When the building goes 6-2-2, there is a Nichibutsu sign with wires coming out of either side sparking away. The best path is the right one under the sign.

4) Try to get the balloon which appears midway on the final 4 wide configuration.


* BUILDING 3 : There is yet another new hazard along with a couple of old ones.

1) People drop flowerpots from the first 6-2-2 configuration to the second 6-2-2 configuration.

2) Right after the 6-4 configuration, Crazy Climber signs will bounce toward your character. There are a couple of methods of dealing with them :

a) First, just slide left or right to avoid them.

b) If they can't be avoided, get both hands on one ledge and pull the joysticks back. This will bring your climber for a hanging position to one where he is resting on his palms. This sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Also, right when the sign is about to hit him, pull back on the joysticks.

3) Another King Kong awaits where the building goes from 4 to 2. Use the Building 1 method to scoot by him.

4) Again, try to get the balloon which appears midway on the final 2 wide configuration.


* BUILDING 4 : There is another hazard in addition to the above. Plus, things happen quickly on this building.

1) In the middle of the first 6-2-2 configuration, is another sign with electrical wires. Use the method from Building 2.

2) The bird appears at the 6-2 configuration and leaves in the middle of the first 2 configuration.

3) From the 2-6 configuration to the middle of the 6 configuration, people are dropping flowerpots on your head.

4) When you come to the final 4-2 configuration, it is usually better to go to the left. This is because the Crazy Climber signs usually come down the right side. Of course, this isn't always true. Use the methods in Building 3 to deal with them.

5) Throughout your climb up this building, various manners of barbells, trash. There is no real defense against these except hold on tightly.

6) Once you complete this building, you are transported back to Building 1 to start again.


* Secret Password : Enter the name 'jordan.ltd' in the high score table and you get two free credits. This only works on the Japanese and bootleg versions of the game (although the password code is still present in the US version, the high score table entry has been crippled to only allow 3 letters, so you can't enter the code).

- TRIVIA -


Released in February 1981.


Crazy Kong - Part II is not a bootleg of "Donkey Kong"!! Falcon DID have a license from Nintendo, but it was NOT for the US. Crazy Kong - Part II was supposed to be for sale outside the US (South America, Europe, etc.), but the lag in production of arcade DK's by Nintendo for a 3 month period during 1981-82 made demand for any DK type game go through the roof. At this time, Nintendo of America was moving from NY-NJ to Redmond WA and there was a 4 month backlog on orders. This opened the door for the illegal Crazy Kongs to fill the demand. Approximately 20,000 Crazy Kong were distributed illegally in the U.S.


The main difference between Crazy Kong and "Donkey Kong" is the sound, and color capabilities. Crazy Kong ran on hardware that had the same processor as "Donkey Kong", but its video capabilities were lacking, and it had a totally different sound chip. Basically what all this means is that Crazy Kong had terrible sound, and some definite strangeness in the color area. The background music is missing entirely, and most of the sound effects have been changed. For example, in Crazy Kong, Mario makes a 'Hiya!' sound when he jumps, instead of the 'Boing!' that he makes in "Donkey Kong". The graphics use slightly different colors, which change from level to level. The Kong animations are also different, and often do not match up with the in game action. There are also mild changes in gameplay. Kong doesn't toss out nearly as many barrels, and there are other mild changes such as gaps in platforms that were not in the original, and the manner in which the elevators work has changed as well.


There were lots of different Crazy Kong cabinets. The most common one was similar in design to the "Donkey Kong" cabinet, but the artwork was more realistic, and the monitor bezel had a circular clear area, as opposed to the rectangle that most games had. Crazy Kong could also be found in cocktail format. These were usually conversions, and were only decorated with an instruction card.


Bootlegs of this game are known as "Monkey Donkey" and "BiG KONG". Some other bootlegs under the same name were made by Jeutel (France), Alca and Orca. A special bootleg was also made on the "Scramble" hardware.


- UPDATES -


The "Scramble" hardware bootleg has additional ingame music and the 'Warp to level 2' trick doesn't work.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Warp To Level 2 (doesn't work on the "Scramble" hardware bootleg version) : Climb up to the second beam (the one with the hammer right by it). Walk to the right so that Mario is still facing away from you (you can see his back) and is suspended off the side of end of the beam, then jump to the right. He'll 'fall thru' the bottom of the screen and clear it, as if he had climbed all the way to the top.


* A Trick : On the conveyor belt level, Grab the bottom hammer (the one on the row with the full length conveyor belt) and go all the way to the right side of the screen. Push the joystick Right and he'll drop the hammer. Sometimes it'll be in the up position and sometimes it'll be sitting toward the left of Mario. If it's in the up position, jump up and grab it and keep repeating until he drops it on the left position. After this, you can walk away and anything that comes into contact with it will be splatted (Good way of getting extra points). After a few seconds, the hammer will disappear, but the stuff will still splat when it hits where the hammer should be. NOTE : This trick only works on the second level or higher!

Crime City (c) 1989 Taito.


A one or two player sideways scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which two cops, by the name of Tony Gibson and Raymond Brody, fight gangs of criminals over six platform-strewn stages. Each stage centres around a specific criminal activity, such as bank robbery or smuggling. The ultimate goal in Crime City is to find the King-pin 'boss' characters that await the players at the end of each level, and arrest them.


The game's heroes start each level armed with a pistol, and extra weapons become available as players progress through a level. Both the pistol and additional weapons have only a limited amount of ammunition, and if players runs out of ammo, they will only be able to punch or "somersault attack" into attacking enemies. Each stage features numerous background items that can be used to attack enemies, such as wooden barrels, boxes and hanging lights. When shot, some criminals drop packets of illegal drugs, which can be picked up for bonus points.


Crime City's gameplay takes its inspiration from both Namco's "Rolling Thunder" and Sega's "Shinobi".

Released in July 1989.


Also released as "Crime Fighters [4-Player model]".


Some bosses' character design in this game seem to have been inspired by popular horror movies, this seems true for three bosses in particular :

Stage 2 Boss : A parody of Jason Voorhees from 'Friday the 13th movie' series.

Stage 4 Boss : A distant parody of Leatherface from 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' movie series.

Stage 5 Boss : A parody of Freddy Krueger from 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' movie series.


The dying pose that the Stage 7 boss does seems to have been inspired by the movie poster from the 1986 film Platoon.


King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Collection Vol.2 - KICA-1016) on 21/08/1990.


- UPDATES -


The US version is slightly different, it has the 'Winners Don't Use Drugs' screen.


There are quite a few differences between the 4-Player version and the 2-Player versions of the same game :


4-PLAYER VERSION :

* This is a 2-button game (punch & kick).

* Character's energy is represented by a numerical hit point value which is always on countdown to zero. Additional hit points may be added by inserting more coins into each player's corresponding coin slot.

* Characters can use a reversal kick which is automatically activated if an opponent is behind you as you press the kick button. This kick knocks down enemies (except bosses) with a single hit!

* The gun has limited ammo, however it is possible to pick it up again if an enemy knocks it off your hand. Also each gunshot is as strong as 3 punches or kicks and knocks down most enemies in one shot.

* You can play the extra stage (enemy boss revenge) more than once.


2-PLAYER VERSIONS :

* Commonly seen as a 2-button game (punch & kick) but actually is a 3-button game (can be confirmed in the game's test mode).

* Character's energy is represented by a life-bar which only decreases with enemy attacks.

* There is a timer as well as a credit counter.

* The 3rd button is a reversal attack, which works as another kick button since you can use a pretty effective 3-hit combo (back kick, back kick, roundhouse kick). However you can't use this button to kick downed opponents.

* The gun has unlimited ammo, however you will lose it permanently if an enemy knocks it off your hand. Also the gun is now just as weak as a normal punch or kick and it takes 3 consecutive shots to knock down a normal enemy.

* You can play the extra stage (enemy boss revenge) only once.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Unlimited Credits : Successfully complete the entire game two consecutive times.

Crystal Castles (c) 1983 Atari.


Crystal Castles is a merry chase into a mythical land of incredible creatures that thrill at every turn of game play. Its hero, Bentley Bear, collects gemstones as he moves around 16 different playfields, including a castle, fortress, palace, and even a dungeon. Scary creatures, such as nasty trees, gem eaters, a swarm of bees, and Berthilda the witch, chase Bentley Bear as he explores tunnels, elevators that take him from one plateau to another, and sometimes a secret ramp.


Crystal Castles has 3 new features. Even if you are familiar with Atari games, you should note these important differences :

Lighted Midi Trak-Ball. The Midi Trak-Ball on the control panel of this game is translucent. A small lamp controlled by the game PCB shines through the ball. The result is a glowing Trak-Ball. During game play, the lamp flashes on and off creating a spectacular effect.


Crystal Castles is a fast-action, 1- or 2-player, third-person adventure game. By using the Lighted Midi Trak-Ball, the player moves Bentley Bear about the castle walkways and walls to collect gems. To avoid being overpowered by gem eaters, nasty trees, or bee swarms, use the left- or right-hand jump buttons.


The player's objective is to collect all the gems from the castle walkways and walls by moving Bentley Bear about the castle with the Trak-Ball controller. Bentley Bear must collect all the gems without being killed by any of the 8 possible computer-controlled opponents-crystal balls, trees, a swarm of bees, gem eaters, Berthilda the witch, a ghost, a skeleton, or a dust devel. In the lower levels of game play, this feat is easily learned by new players. In higher levels, experience, skill, and luck help the player to accomplish the objective.


When game play begins, Bentley Bear is at the lower right corner of the castle walkway. Immediately after the player's control is enabled for moving Bentley Bear, the opponents are displayed about the castle walkways and walls. The player may move Bentley Bear either up or down the stairs or the elevators to get the gems. When Bentley Bear passes over a gem, the gem disappears. Points are scored for each gem collected by Bentley Bear and shown in the score display area. If Bentley collects all the gems from the castle, the player receives bonus points. The initial bonus is 1,000 points for the first castle of the first level. The bonus is increased by 100 points for each subsequent castle (i.e., the bonus for castle 2 of level l is 1,200 points; castle 1 of level 2 is 1,400 points; etc.).


When a start button is pressed, the gems and Bentley Bear appear on the castle walkway and the game tune begins.  Soon afterward, three crystal balls (the only opponents of this wave) drop from above and land at the far right corner of the castle walkway. These three balls begin a slow pursuit of Bentley Bear.  As the Trak-Ball is rotated, Bentley Bear moves about the walkway.  As he passes over a gem, the gem disappears and a score value is added to the score in the window at the top left of the display.  If Bentley Bear gets all the gems, the three balls rise out of sight above the castle. Then Bentley Bear also disappears.  If Bentley Bear gets the last gem, the message YOU GOT THE LAST GEM. BONUS 1000 appears across the castle.  If the opponents get the last gem, the message THEY GOT THE LAST GEM. NO BONUS appears across the castle.


Crystal Castles consists of 37 castle mazes that are laid out with a walkway between each castle. The castles are arranged in ten levels with four castles on each level, except for level 10, which has only one castle. As Bentley Bear advances to the next castle on each level, the difficulty in collecting all the gems increases. Each level also increases in complexity. The result is a nice variety of mazes, from the easy first castle of level l to the extremely difficult castles in the higher levels. At the beginning of play at each castle, a message appears in the window at the top right of the display. This message identifies the level being played. Other messages, such as next bonus point level, also appear in this window.


Bentley Bear has 8 opponents : crystal balls, trees, a swarm of bees, gem eaters, Berthilda the witch, a ghost, a skeleton, and a caldron. If Bentley Bear touches a gem eater while it is in the process of eating a gem, the gem eater dies and 500 points are awarded the player. However, if the gem eater is not eating a gem when Bentley Bear touches it, Bentley Bear dies. When Bentley Bear is wearing his magic red hat, he is invincible.  When he is wearing the hat he has the power to kill Berthilda the witch when he touches her. However, the magic of the hat only lasts about 5 seconds.


Each of the opponents has its own characteristic. The swarm of bees appears near the honey approximately every five seconds. However if Bentley Bear takes the honey, he collects 1,000 points for the honey, and the bees will appear less frequently. The gem eaters are relatively stupid creatures. The only thing they are interested in is eating gems. However, if gems are not in their area, the gem eaters will rush around randomly looking for gems. The crystal balls and trees act much the same. They will go directly for Bentley Bear.  However, if Bentley keeps obstacles between him and either of these opponents, he is relatively safe from attack. The skeleton and the ghost usually stay within their immediate areas, move about randomly, but not very fast. They guard their area well. Berthilda the witch flies around on her broom in one small area in the lower levels of game play. However, in the higher levels she boldly flies about the castles.


- TECHNICAL -


5,380 units were produced. There were 2 different Crystal Castles cabinets, an upright and a cocktail. Both of these were highly detailed and covered with decorations. The upright had a production run of 4880 and the cocktail had a production run of 500.

* The Crystal Castles upright was one of the best looking cabinets ever made. It is sort of colored white, and has huge painted sideart of Bentley Bear gathering gems in the castle. The marquee has a futuristic looking logo flanked with two in game scenes on a black background. There is a second mini-marquee over the speaker are that has a large Atari logo. For some reason that logo ends up going missing on many machines, and don't believe sellers when they say it is a cheap or easy part to find, because it isn't. The control panel continues the same graphical scheme as the rest of the machine. It has a standard trackball mounted centrally with fire/start buttons on either side. These trackballs eventually become worn out or damaged, and are mildly expensive to replace.

* The cocktail version has no sideart, very few cocktail machines do. But the top glass is nicely decorated and the control panel art matches the upright version. The players sit across from each other on this version, and the on screen image flips over to face whichever player is currently controlling Bentley Bear.

- TRIVIA -


When it first appeared in arcades in July 1983, Crystal Castles amazed players with its sharp graphics and pseudo 3-D mazes.


The game was originally supposed to be a variation on the mega-hit "Asteroids" and the working title was 'Toporoids' (from TOPOgraphics and asteROIDS). It featured a one-legged robot and/or a spaceship placed in 3-D mazes lined with asteroids and the goal was (of course) to shoot them. The mazes were similar to those in Crystal Castles.


The character 'Bentley Bear' was originally named 'Braveheart Bear' in the released prototypes. But, Atari ran into trouble over that name from the American Indians and so had to change it. Whenever Bentley is killed, he shrinks, and says something in a cartoon-type balloon above his head. The four possible sayings are: OUCH; OH NO; BYE; and #?!.


Originally, FXL designed the game so that Bentley could jump while in a tunnel. But he decided to take that ability away when he saw Bentley's head popping through the roof!


All of the musical themes in the game are from works of classical music. The tune when you first start the game and the bonus life music, are both from The Mephisto Waltz by Liszt. The last gem bonus music is from one of the scenes in Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite. And, the triumphant theme played when you complete level 10 is of course from The 1812 Overture, again from Tchaikovsky.


If you hadn't noticed, the color schemes of the castles change during the game, and from one game to the next. The colors in the first level are always the same. From level 2 thru 6, they appear in a set order, but every 100 paid games, this set order changes. Finally, in levels 7 and up, the color scheme is picked randomly. A most odd arrangement! There are 17 possible maze color schemes, and four different color possibilities on every board: gem, floor, front wall, and side wall colors. But, each one is not randomly picked and mixed with the other; they are pre-determined as a group, and then the whole group is chosen randomly. The possible gem colors are red, blue, white, and yellow. The floor can be white, black, or pea-green. And, there are 12 possibilities for wall colors, including pink, maroon, and peach!


On two of the mazes in the game, FXL has built into the structure initials of friends of his. On Hidden Spiral, the DES stands for Desiree McCrorey, who holds a contest record on "Mr. Do!". SSM is Sam Mehta, who came in 2nd in a "Centipede" contest held by Atari. And BBM stands for Brian McGhee, a former Atari game designer. On Berthilda's Palace, the initials are harder to make out, as they are cutouts in the floor. EDG is the initials of Eric Ginner, while MAR stands for Mark Robichek. Both of these were famous video game players at the time Crystal was made and are still known by many. Other initials appear in the game, on the above-mentioned scoreboard. While many are made up, some stand for real people. FXL appears in the top 3 spots on a new, or newly reset, game scoreboard and he also appears at other places in the top 250 initials. MEC appears more than once also. This stands for Mark Cerny, a fellow designer at Atari. He is responsible for "Marble Madness".


Note : The formula for calculating the points given for the last gem bonus on a particular level and board number is 1000 + ((((level x 4) - 1) - (4 - board)) x 100).


Frank Seay holds the official record for this game with 910,722 points.


A Crystal Castles units appears in the 1984 movie 'Gremlins'.


- SCORING -


Points awarded for collecting gems.

Killing Gem Eaters : 500 or 1,000 points.

Collecting the honeypot : 1,000 points.

Collecting the witch's hat : 2,000 points.

Killing Berthilda : bonus points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Warps : There's a 'continue option' warp on the first board. It won't take you any higher than level 8, though.

1) The first warp is behind the palace on the upper-right hand corner of the first board. Go there then jump. It'll take you to level 3.

2) The second warp : get the hat, run to an elevator, and at the back corner of the hidden ramp, jump before the hat expires. The warp always gives you four lives (not including the one you're on) and takes you to level 5.

3) The third warp is on the third screen of Level 5, titled 'Crossroads'. It is extremely easy to trigger; just move to the very upper left corner and jump. You will be transported to the first screen of Level 7, again with four lives to spare. There are no other warps.


* A Trick : If you jump at least 128 times in the front right corner of any maze, the next maze that is fully drawn from the beginning will have a string of the words ATARI stretched across the middle of the screen. It disappears on the next maze, unless you are playing a two-player game, in which case it can appear on two screens.


* Another Trick : On Level 5, Berthilda's Palace grab the hat and enter the large door where Berthilda is. Run over her for 3000 points, then head to the corner of the room (where Berthilda was) and jump. The initials FXL will appear in the lower-right hand corner of the screen, which stands for Franz Lanziger, one of the designers of Crystal Castles!


* This Trick Is Free : When the machine is in its demo mode, wait until the first stage appears. When Bentley gets killed, hold down BOTH jump buttons and the accounting screen, which shows customer play information, will appear.


* Secret Message : When you complete level 10, a special screen appears that says, I GIVE UP : YOU WIN  YOU MUST BE _______________.

What goes in the blank depends on the number of lives you have left.

* Time Bonus : For every four seconds of game play, you lose 1000 points. The amount of time bonus starts at 200,000, so you can figure that a 5 minute game will have a time bonus of 125,000. Also, for every life you lose, you lose at least 1000 time bonus points, so even though you can make up for your life as far as the life bonus, you still lose in time bonus.

Released in November 1979.


Upon joining Namco, Mr. Iwatani wanted to design pinball games. Gee Bee, Cutie Q and Bomb Bee were his early video game/pinball hybrids. Toru Iwatani would achieve later, greater fame by designing "Pac-Man".


- SCORING -


EXTRA rollovers : 100 points.

Drop Targets : 10 points.

Faces : 50 points.

Spinner : 10 points.

Side Traps : X amount of points, in 100 point increments.

Ghosts in middle roll-through : number of points listed above targets.


Adjustments to scoring :

Finishing all drop targets in an area brings up a ghost. Hit it, and you get a certain number of points (shown near the ghost) multiplied by a number which changes quickly. If the ghost is hit (or if it makes it to the edge of the area), the drop targets return with an extra row of two drops to work on each time.

Make all faces into smiley faces increases bonus multiplier up to 3X

Light up 'EXTRA' on either side will give you a shot in one of the side drains for an extra ball. Once gotten, the 'Extra' rollovers will disappear.

Dangun Feveron (c) 1998 Cave.


A vertically scrolling shoot-em-up from the undisputed masters of the genre, 'Cave', Dangun Feveron features the usual Cave trademarks of intuitive, power-up driven gameplay backed-up with superb graphics and sound.


Dangun Feveron features a very high level of player customisation. At the start of a new game, players are prompted to select 3 different ship attributes; the speed of ship they wish to pilot (from a choice of four), which of the 3 rapid-fire weapons they prefer, and their preferred choice of sustained-fire weapons (activated by holding down the FIRE button). This allows players to tailor the ship to suit their individual needs and gameplay styles, be it a fast-flying speeder with widespread shots to handle enemy squadrons, or a ship with a lower speed that makes it easier to negotiate the swathes of enemy bullets that often fill the screen.


Another of the game's selling points is the capture-and-score system. Initially, every enemy destroyed is worth only one point. However, whenever an enemy is destroyed, coloured spheres appear in its wake, each containing a trapped, human prisoner. The spheres can then be collected by the player to earn additional points. For each prisoner saved, the total points gained from each enemy killed increases by one. For example, saving 56 prisoners means every subsequent defeated enemy is worth fifty-seven points. When the spheres appear, they drift slowly towards the bottom of the screen, before moving back up towards the top where, if they are not collected in time, they drift out of the screen and beyond the player's reach. This resets enemy-destroyed score back to a single point per enemy. If the player loses all of their lives and chooses to 'Continue' the game, the rescue count is reset to zero.


Dangun Feveron's final destinction was in its use of music and sound effects, with the game's creators drawing heavily on the disco sound of the 1970s.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Secret Guest Character (from "Uo Poko") : insert a coin and press quickly Down, Up, Right, Left, Up, Down, Left, Right, Start. 1P cat's name is Uotaro and 2P cat's is Poko (81). Note : At the continue (when you loose), you need to enter this code a second time, just after inserting a new credit, to continue to play with this guest character.


* Time Attack Mode : insert a coin, hold A+B and press Start simultaneously.


* You can kill enemies offscreen to the left and right, but not the top and bottom. This can be very useful for getting to later patterns. DM will still appear.


* If you have your side-guns powered up, a quick change in direction can be used to 'whip' their spread to kill popcorn enemies. Useful for killing offscreen enemies as well.


* There are specific triggers, sometimes apart from killing things fast that cause new formations to appear. Many yet to be deciphered.


* At ~2200 DM a 1UP will appear at the center of the screen. Usually triggered late in stage 3 or early in stage 4.


* Seems it is best to use Ship B with bomb or roll. Bomb appears to be higher scoring (due to chaining explosions) and require more planning, while roll is more frantic but kills many large enemies quickly.


* There is a maximum saturation of DM that can be onscreen at one time ~80. After which no DM will spawn, this can be detrimental to score especially in Stage 3.


* If the sphere boss at the end of stage 5 is beaten having not died, you will get a level bonus, then face the true boss. You will be invincible unless you use bombs and will get another level bonus when you kill it.


* Bonus for clearing the game is 100,000 per bomb and 500,000 per life left. These are doubled if you finish by defeating the true last boss.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* General sequence :

1) When you are not invincible -> (get hit by a bullet) -> PISTER

2) All states -> (fixed time without collecting power-up) -> degenerate

3) PISTER -> (get hit by a bullet) -> die

4) All states -> (get hit by an enemy) -> die


* Evolution sequence (when you collect a power-up) :

PISTER -> BEAS (your starting level) -> BASUM -> SHARRU -> MISEAVE -> TWIPET -> DODOK -> ZUGAU -> KUES -> SHASUEM -> ZUGOGA -> GYASHARRU


* Degeneration sequence (at fixed time without collecting power-up) :

1) GYASHARRU -> ZUGOGA -> SHASUEM -> KUES -> ZUGAU -> DODOK -> TWIPET -> MISEAVE -> SHARRU -> BASUM -> BEAS

2) LAYSPER -> BASUM

3) SUPPURATE -> PISTER

4) BLACK DEAME -> PISTER

5) DEAME -> SEAS -> MALTO -> MEASA -> ZUGAU


* Mutation sequence :

1) All states -> (hit the orange smoke released by the 'bird' alien that flies from the screen bottom) -> SUPPURATE (bullet invincible) 

2) SHARRU -> (degeneration) -> BASUM -> (collect power-up) -> LAYSPER (you front shot is invisible)

3) KUES -> (degeneration) -> ZUGAU -> (collect power-up) -> MEASA -> MALTO -> SEAS -> DEAME


* Opposite evolution :

DEAME -> (get hit by a bullet) -> BLACK DEAME (bullet invincible)


* Bomb upgrade :

1) Shoot horizontal stick aliens the right number of times and they will drift slowly down the screen. Dock with this to get extra firepower. This also works with the aliens that have extendible poles that spring out from their sides : just shoot them until they flash and dock with them.

2) You can also dock with the rectangular aliens (after you have shot them a few times). These appear close to the start of the game. It seems anything you shoot that then drifts slowly down, you can dock with (which increases the bomb power).

Datsun 280 Zzzap (c) 1976 Midway.


The game is a simple black and white monochrome driving game. You control a car through a night time scene, and the road is represented by simple posts at the edges. The top of the screen will display information about upcoming curves (like the maximum safe speed to take them at), while the bottom of the screen has a speedometer, timer, scoreboard, and may also display a few tips as well. Just drive, and don't crash. Pay attention to your speed on the corners to avoid crashing.


- TECHNICAL -


This game came in an upright format. The cabinet was painted blue with simple striped sideart. The marquee was integrated into the monitor bezel and may bear one of three different titles (with four distinct marquees/bezels). The most common one showed a picture of a yellow Datsun 280Z and said '280 Zzzap', the other three versions had stripes that matched the side of the machine, and were labeled either 'Midnight Racer', '280 Zzzap', or 'Datsun 280 Zzzap'. This game uses a 23'' black and white television as a monitor.

Originally called 'Midnite Racer' when Midway acquired the right from Digital Games to create the game (01/1976). Midway released their final version 10 months after at the AMOA as 'Datsun 280 Zzzap'. Here is the reason for the game's name change : Midway came up with a marketing promotion where winners in various categories would win a Datsun 280Z. Realizing that their driving game would be a perfect tie-in, they renamed it Datsun 280 Zzzap.

Defender (c) 1980 Williams.


Your mission, as Captain of the Defender, is to protect the stranded humanoids on the planet surface from the alien abductors. For close-range search-and-destroy accuracy, thrust across the field into the heat of action; for long-range strategy planning, the scanner will give you an overall view of the entire attack force.


It's best to shoot down the alien ships before they reach the humanoids. Once they've captured their prey, you can still destroy them, but then you must also catch the humanoids as they are released from the aliens' grasp and return them to the safety of the planet or they will fall to their death. If an alien swoops down and carries its victim out of your range, the humanoid will mutate, becoming a permanent part of the alien force and the ship, revitalized with incredible powers, will take to the assault with new and deadly vengeance!  Throughout the entire mission, you must act quickly or face possible destruction by the cosmic baiter, a most deadly enemy! If all the humanoids are successfully abducted, the entire planet will explode in a blinding flash!


The challenge becomes ever more intense as action progresses. Fighter ships and their mines will soon join the abductors in testing your skill. You must also destroy mother ships. But beware! A direct hit smashes the mother ship into a swarming mass of mini-ships that then must be wiped out!


Use your 2 escape options only if all else fails! The power to activate your 'smart bomb' button which destroys all the enemies in your sight is limited!  And 'hyperspace', like Russian Roulette, can backfire! 'Hyperspace' puts you in a time warp, take you out of the immediate space and time, but putting you into a possibly even more dangerous situation! You must think wisely and act quickly for you alone are responsible for the consequences and there's no turning back!

- TRIVIA -


Along with Namco's seminal "Pac-Man", Defender shares the title of 'Highest Grossing Video Game of All Time' and to date has earned more than one billion dollars. It's interesting to note that when the now-legendary shoot-em-up was first shown at a 1981 Chicago arcade machine trade show, it was deemed to be a flop due to its high level of difficulty. Arcade industry insiders confidently predicted that both Defender and "Pac-Man" would be commercial flops and that Namco's "Rally X" would be the next major arcade success.


Defender's attract mode for the game was programmed in just 5 hours.


Defender was noted for both its superb sound and visual effects and, moreover, for its extremely demanding gameplay. This didn't, however, stop players from accumulating millions of points when playing the game. Just minutes after the opening of the AMOA - an arcade industry trade show - Eugene Jarvis and his team - Defender's creators - were burning new ROMs for the game's display due to the fact they plugged the first burn into the board BACKWARDS and fried them. Due to the intimidating controls, hardly anyone at the show played the game and there were even rumours circulating suggesting that both "Pac-Man" and Defender would flop and that Namco's "Rally X" would be the next big hit. Not only did Defender have the highest number of controls (five buttons, in addition to a two-way joystick) but it was also the first video game to feature an artificial 'world', in that game events occured OUTSIDE the on-screen viewing area presented to the player.


Chris Hoffman holds the official record for this game on 'Marathon' settings with 79,976,975 points on January 1, 1984.

Bill Jones holds the official record for this game on 'Tournament' settings with 543,950 points on August 15, 2008.


Some bootlegs of this game are known as "Star Trek 1981", "Defence Command", "Defense Command", "Zero" (Jeutel), and "Tornado" (Jeutel).


Defender inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Defender' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album.


A Defender unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Terms of Endearment', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks' and in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance'.


A mini Defender unit appears in the 1984 music video 'Almost Over You' by Sheena Easton.


MB (Milton Bradley) released a boardgame based on this video game (same name) in 1983 : win the most points by using your Defender ships to protect Humanoids from waves of aliens. A set of chance cards will bring the different aliens (Bombers, Landers and Humanoids) into play. Movement is determined with a spinner. Players can move their defenders and aliens.


- UPDATES -


Defender ROM sets were distinguished by early and later editions. The early edition supported only upright cabinets. In 1981 Williams released a cocktail cabinet version which necessitated extra code to flip the video display and to support a second set of game controls. The editions had some minor differences in the game's attract mode : The early edition gave an erroneous point value of '100' for alien landers; this was corrected to '150' in the later edition. Also, the high score value for player PGD was '14185' in the early edition and '14285' in the later edition.


Early edition ROM sets :

* Defender (White Label)

* Defender (Green Label)


Later edition ROM sets :

* Defender (Red Label)

Wave 2 : Humanoids Left X 200.

Wave 3 : Humanoids Left X 300.

Wave 4 : Humanoids Left X 400.

Wave 5 and above : Humanoids Left X 500.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* The enemies that initially appear in each wave are :

Wave 1 : 15 Landers

Wave 2 : 20 Landers, 3 Bombers, and 1 Pod

Wave 3 : 20 Landers, 4 Bombers, and 3 Pods

Waves 4 and up : 20 Landers, 5 Bombers, and 4 Pods


* Avoid using hyperspace unless you are about to die. Fighting off attacks, regardless of the number of enemies, will make you a better Defender player.


* Baiters can usually be overcome by hitting the reverse button twice quickly. They will fly past you and be in range for your fire power. Do NOT try to outrun them as baiters are faster than your ship.


* Swarmers are easy to defeat. You can hit reverse as soon as they fly past you and fly behind them. They cannot shoot backwards so you can blast away at will.


* Shooting a Pod will usually release between 4 and 7 Swarmers. However, there can be a maximum of 20 Swarmers on the screen at any time. For example, if there are 18 Swarmers on the screen and a Pod is hit, it will only release 2 Swarmers.


* At higher levels, you will need to play God and even sacrifice some Humanoids (by killing them yourself) to preserve the rest of the planet's population. The planet is too large for you protect and you are sparing the Humanoids from a fate worst than death (mutation). Do not worry, these Humanoids reproduce quickly and overpopulation has always been a constant problem. The planet will be fully populated at the start of every fifth attack wave (configurable).


* See Credits : to see the designers' credits, do the following while in game play:  Down, Reverse, 1P Start, Thrust, Reverse, 2P Start, Fire, Down, 1P Start, Thrust and Fire.


* The International Date Line : there are reverse lines for Swarmers and Mutants (AKA the 'International Date Line'). If this line is between you and the type of enemy in question, they will travel the opposite direction around the planet to get you (i.e. they won't cross this line to get to you). If a Mutant, say, is following you and you cross the Mutant reverse line (to the left of the big mountain) it will suddenly reverse direction and go around the other way. The same is true for the Swarmer reverse line (located approximately where your ship starts each wave). This doesn't affect Swarmers that you are following behind. If you're on one side of the line and a Pod is on the other and you shoot it open, the Swarmers will fly away from you and you can get in behind them immediately. The best use of these lines is where there are lots of Swarmers and/or Mutants that you don't want to hassle with. You stay near the line and go back and forth over it to keep the enemy on the other side of the planet. This is especially useful in space and waves that get really hairy.


* Freeze : you can freeze a Defender machine by picking up all ten Humanoids (on any wave, but Wave 1 is your greatest chance at success), stopping all forward motion of your ship, quieting the screen down (i.e. having no enemies moving around on it) and setting all the Humanoids straight down quickly. This seems to work better were the terrain is very close to the bottom of the screen. Everything will freeze, but you can still move your ship up and down. Thrusting will break the spell, so to speak. If you do pick a spot with shallow terrain, some Humanoids will go thru the bottom of the screen and appear suspended in mid-air near the top. This trick is good to use during marathon games when you've reached Wave 256 and need a breather.


* Some top players begin each round by shooting all the Humanoids except for one, which they pick up. The planet is too large for you protect and you are sparing the Humanoids from mutation, a fate worse than death. This keeps Mutants from developing, but it also means that the planet explodes if you lose your last Humanoid. The planet is fully repopulated at the start of every fifth attack wave (configurable). This can be considered an advanced trick.


* Due to a bug in the algorithm that computes extra lives, every scoring activity from 990,000 to 999,975 will earn one extra ship and one extra Smart Bomb. If the player suicides on something or gets shot, one ship is lost, but one ship and one smart bomb are awarded; the net effect on the number of ships is zero. Dying on hyperspace re-entry awards nothing, because this awards no points. For winning N ships from 990,000 to 999,975, the player will have to achieve N x 10,000 points after passing 1,000,000 before the game's accounting balances, and ships are awarded properly at 10,000 point intervals again. For example, if a player earns 45 extra lives during this interval, he will have to score another 450,000 points before being awarded another extra life.  The player gets to keep surplus ships and bombs and can have super long turns where he may bomb 2 to 3 times per wave to get out of dangerous situations.

* The trick is this. If the player wins 100+ ships between 990,000 and 1,000,000, this causes the game to start awarding extra lives right away again after turning the score over to zero. If the player wins 100 ships, the machine will have to wait 1,000,000 points to begin awarding ships again. However, since 1,000,000 is equivalent to zero, it awards them immediately at 1,010,000.


* It's possible on a real Defender machine to make the screen color inverted so that all the black space is white while you are playing. It will reset itself when you die and maybe when you use hyperspace. Smart bomb flashes are cool when it's reversed. The trick was to drop a credit in right when you die and the screen flashes white. Somehow the program gets distracted (non masked interrupt on coin drop?) and the screen stays white.


* Defender attack waves 'roll over' at wave 100, which is displayed, after being completed, as wave 0. The game keeps track of the actual number of waves, even though they are not shown properly. For example, the next wave will be counted as wave 101, even though it shows being completed as wave 1. The game will 'roll over' again at wave 200, which is displayed, after being completed, as wave 0 as well.

The next 'roll over' occurs at wave 256. Upon completion of wave 255, the next wave is a 'blank' wave, in which no enemies appear, and the wave immediately ends after the player's ship appears on screen. This level is counted and displayed as Wave 0, and the player is awarded a bonus of humanoids left X 0 points (the bonus for this wave is always 0 points). The next is wave 1, and the game now plays just as if the player had started a new game, except the player gets to keep his score and all of his bonus ships and smart bombs.

- TRIVIA -


This bootleg of "Defender" resulted in a far-reaching legal decision in US copyright law. Williams sued the distributor of the game, Artic International, for copyright infringements of 1) the game's ROM code and 2) the 'look-and-feel' of the attract and play modes.


Artic never contested that the 'Defense Command' ROM code had been lifted from the Williams "Defender" game; over 85% of the code was identical in both games. However, Artic argued that ROM chips should be considered as 'utilitarian objects', much like common knobs and gears which are beyond the scope of copyright law. Artic had used this argument unsuccessfully in a similar case against Midway Manufacturing.


The court reaffirmed the previous legal decision against Artic. Under US copyright law, intellectual property can be protected if it is made permanent in some way (known in legal terms as 'fixation'). Computer code stored in ROM chips met this requirement. Artic lost its case against Williams.


The Midway/Williams decisions against Artic set an important legal precedent : compiled computer code was protected under copyright law regardless of the medium of storage.

- SCORING -


Collecting a crystal : 100 points.

Dropping a crystal in the shuttle : 100, 200, 300 etc up to 1,000 points then back to 100 points.

Each second survived : 10 points.

Destroying large alien with tail : 1,500 points.

Off centre hit on large alien : up to 1,300 points.

Destroying a mutated crystal : 400 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* At the start of the game, concentrate on loading as many crystals as you can. Don't worry about the enemy ships yet as they are easy to avoid.


* The mutated aliens with the tails which appear later in the game are worth the most points. You get 1,500 for a direct hit destroying them, but also points for each near non-fatal hit. Get a few hits off-target if you can, as they can be worth 1,300 points each!


* Keep an eye on your shot power remaining and be ready to collect a crystal if necessary to recharge.


* If the shuttle appears on screen level with the bottom block, keep collecting crystals and don't drop any off until the shuttle is clear of the block. You can often lose a life if you are carrying a crystal and can't get to the shuttle before it explodes.

Depthcharge (c) 1977 Gremlin.


Depthcharge is a 2-Dimensional shooter. You control your destroyer on the surface of the water while submarines patrol underneath. Your job is to drop depth charges to eliminate these submarines. The submarines aren't defenseless as they launch mines straight up toward your ship.


Depthcharge was one of the early video games. Action was simple. This game also had the ability to retain the highest score (without the initials of course). Although the game is simple in concept, just trying to get enough points was enough to keep you working at it. Good luck on your submarine hunting mission.

Released during September 1977.


This game is also known as "Sub Hunter" (Taito).


Martin Bedard holds the official record for this game with 4,770 points on November 18, 2007.


- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is pretty simple :

* Submarines will have their score posted on their hull. The submarine scores are from 10 to 90 incrementing in 10's. For example, if you see 40 on the submarine, then that submarine is worth 40 points.

* Generally speaking, the lower in depth the submarine is, the higher the value for the submarine.

* You get 90 seconds on the timer to do as much damage as possible. If you score 500 points or greater, you will get an additional 45 seconds for overtime.

* After you are totally done, you get 30 points for each submarine killed. You do not lose points for losing your ship although it takes about 2 seconds to get a new one.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your destroyer will be in the middle of the water. You will start seeing submarines entering the screen either from the left or right and at varying depths. You have a total of 6 depth charges that can be on the screen at any one time. This means if you fire all 6, then you have to

wait until one detonates on a submarine or the bottom of the sea before you get them back.


* Try to aim your shots to where the submarine will be at. This is, in a sense, ''leading'' the submarine. This is especially important if you are trying to get those submarines at the bottom of the sea.


* Always try to keep at least 2 depth charges in reserve. This is for those submarines that are close to the surface that like to throw mines you cannot avoid.


* Try to keep moving around in your destroyer. If you sit in one place, the submarines can put mines on either side of your ship and prevent you from escaping and adding a destroyer to their kills.


* Don't fire your depth charges too close together on one side. The reason is if a submarine is killed by one of them and the other one is too close, it will also detonate. If you were aiming at another submarine with the second one, then your shot is wasted.


* In addition to the mines themselves being dangerous, your ship can also be sunk by the effects of the mines. Don't sit too close when a mine detonates or you will be at the bottom of the sea.


* If you ''walk'' your shots you have a better chance of getting a good spread and taking out multiple submarines. Kind of like leaving a diagonal string of depth charges the submarines must pass through.  Plus, you don't lose your other depth charges to the detonation of ones around them.


* Try to get the 500 required for extra time, it isn't too hard if you play smartly.

Destination Earth (c) 1979.


Destination Earth is a combination two-dimensional simple flight simulator and two-dimensional shooter. You start the game by floating within your mother ship. You then either must release your lander or after a pre-determined period of time, the mother ship will forcibly eject it. You first have to navigate through 6 rows of asteroids to make it to one of the landing platforms. You have 6 platforms initially but each landing will eliminate one since there is 1 platform per astronaut you have to rescue. On your return trip up, the screen changes and now you have saucers trying to destroy you with laser fire. Again, you will either have 3 or 6 rows of saucers depending if there are meteors in the area. You then must successfully land in the docking bay of the mother ship to get credit for a successful rescue of 1 astronaut.

Large Saucer : 30 points

Small Saucer: 50 points

Platform : 50, 100, 150 points


Each man rescued has an increasing value until stage four where it is at its maximum. The values are:

Stage 1 : 50 points

Stage 2 : 100 points

Stage 3 : 150 points

Stage 4 : 300 points

Every stage after stage 4 is 300 points.


Fuel remaining is added to your score (i.e. if you have 560 Fuel left, then add 560 points to your score) at the end of a wave.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


When you start the game, your lander will be sitting in the docking bay of the mother ship. You can release your lander by pressing the firing button or wait until the mother ship forcibly ejects you. It's better to do it yourself lest the mother ship ejects you on top of an asteroid.


* Fuel is a precious commodity in this game, use it sparingly. You only have 800 units of fuel to rescue 6 men. If you burn all your fuel off on the first rescue, you will have nothing to fall back on for the other 5.


* When you leave the mother ship, try to navigate through the asteroids without using any fuel. Since your lander doesn't accelerate during the fall, you will be going at a constant speed down. Try to maneuver between the rocks to land on a platform. You also don't need to decelerate when landing, you just land.


* Try to knock out the harder platforms first. This means, land on the harder to reach ones on the sides first. A good strategy is to get the right hand-one first, then the two left-hand ones, then finish by landing on the three in the middle.


* If you must use fuel, use quick bursts to get into position to land on a platform. Fuel burns up very quickly in this game so some quick shots to the thrusters should keep you out of trouble. Keep in mind, as the waves progress, the asteroids move faster and become more numerous.


* Once you've landed, the little guy will run over and get in your lander. The screen will then change and you will see 3 to 6 rows of saucers blocking your path. Again, as the waves progress, the saucers and meteors get faster and more numerous. There are a couple of different strategies for this section:

1) If you only see 3 lower rows of saucers, look to the upper right or left corner. More than likely, some meteors will be coming diagonally down to the opposite corner. The best solution is to quickly blast a path through the saucers and get above the meteors trajectory.

2) If you see 6 rows of saucers, then you need to blast a path through them to get to your mother ship. Keep in mind that the fire button acts as a dual fire/thrust button. When you fire, you accelerate yourself up just a bit. In other words, no point blank shooting or you may end up taking out the saucer with your lander. When you have cleared a path, use the fire button to get yourself quickly above the saucers.


* The saucers firing just drop their shots on you. Because of their numbers, you may find yourself surrounded by enemy fire. The best solution is again to blast a path through them. Once a saucer is destroyed, it doesn't come back. Also keep in mind that you can only have one shot on the screen at a time.


* Once you get 1 row from the bottom of the mother ship, it will stop and open its docking bay door. If you are too far away, you will fail to dock with the mother ship and get destroyed by the top of the screen. If you hit the side of the mother ship, the man you are rescuing will unfortunately fall from your lander to his death to the planet below. Plan out the best strategy to make sure that you stay in the middle so you can catch the mother ship with minimal effort.

* Wait on the other side of a gate where you know a pursuing octopus will get trapped and pick it off as soon as it gets stuck. If another octopus was close behind the dead one, move back over the gate and kill it when it gets stuck.


* Since the octopuses always pursue you, you can use this to get them to follow the path you want.


* Don't collect extra fish at the start of a screen since no more than 15 can be stored, and any extras are lost.


* Use the side tunnels to move across the screen, and the enemies don't often pursue you through them.


* When being pursued by a fast and small octopus drop two fish in front of it, taking it to its largest size and slowing it down.

Diamond Run (c) 1989 KH Video.


An arcade puzzle game in which a single player must tunnel their way through a number of underground caves, collecting the many gems spread throughout the levels. Each cave is litterered with rocks which, should they fall onto the player, will result in a loss of life. Carefully planned tunnels can be dug to manipulate the direction in which the rocks fall, however, which makes them an effective weapon against the many enemies that populate the levels. A number of red explosives can be found which can also be used to kill enemies and also to destroy any walls blocking the player's path. Again, like the rocks, these must be used carefully to prevent the explosion from killing the player.


In order to complete a level, a specified number of gems must be collected. Once a sufficient amount of gems have been collected, an exit will open which the player must enter to proceed to the next cave.


Diamond Run is heavily based on First Star's Commodore C64 classic, 'Boulder Dash'.

Dig Dug (c) 1982 Namco.


Dig Dug is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster-scan video display. The screen shows a cutaway view of the land, most of which is below ground. The player controls the Dig Dug character who travels through and digs tunnels in the dirt. The object is for Dig Dug to destroy monsters by pumping them up or dropping rocks on them and to capture vegetables.


Game play takes place on a cutaway section of the land. The characters are Dig Dug and 2 monsters - one is a round, orange monster with goggles called Pooka, the other is a green, fire-breathing dragon named Fygar. The underground area is divided into 4 different colored layers of dirt. Rocks are scattered in the dirt. The sky is at the top of the screen.


The player controls Dig Dug, the hero of the garden, clad in white. He moves through horizontal and vertical tunnels. When Dig Dug digs new tunnels he moves slowly. When he is on the surface or in an existing tunnel, he moves faster. The object of the game is for Dig Dug to destroy all the monsters and go to the next round.


Monsters are trapped in caves. A monster may get out of a cave two ways. Dig Dug may dig him out. Then, the monster chases Dig Dug. The monster may also get out of the cave by turning into a ghost. As a ghost, he cannot be destroyed. The ghost does not travel in the tunnels. He travels through the dirt, and can travel diagonally. However, he reappears as the monster when he goes into a tunnel.


The monsters move faster than Dig Dug in vertical tunnels and slower on the surface. They destroy Dig Dug by catching him. In addition, Fygar can destroy Dig Dug by breathing fire on him. Fygar can only breathe fire horizontally. The fire can penetrate the dirt.


Dig Dug destroys the monsters by pumping them up until they burst, or by causing rocks to drop on them. To pump up and destroy a monster, the player presses and holds down the pump button. It is possible to stun a monster for a few seconds by pressing the pump button once or twice. While a monster is stunned, Dig Dug may pass over him without being destroyed. If 2 monsters are very close together, only one may be stunned. The other will catch and destroy Dig Dug.


Dig Dug must dig tunnels under the rocks to get them to drop. A rock may fall in a vertical or horizontal tunnel. A rock also goes through a thin layer of dirt from one tunnel to the next. In a vertical tunnel, Dig Dug may stay directly under a rock and it will not drop. However, in a horizontal tunnel, Dig Dug must move out from under a rock right away, or he will be crushed.


After two rocks are dropped, a vegetable (worth extra points, see Scoring below) appears in a tunnel in the center of the screen. Dig Dug has 10 seconds to capture (touch) the vegetable or it will disappear. There is only one vegetable per round.


The game progresses by rounds. Round 1 starts with four monsters (one Fygar and three Pookas) and three rocks. The vegetable is a carrot. One flower on the surface (top right of the screen) represents Round 1. Two flowers represent Round 2, etc. As the rounds progress, the monsters move a little faster, and are better at avoiding falling rocks. In each round, the last monster tries to escape. If he is not caught by Dig Dug, he exits on the surface (top left).


The game ends when all of Dig Dug's lives are used up. A player may continue to play at the beginning of the same round (level) by following instructions on the screen. He has 16 seconds to insert a coin(s). Then he must push and hold the pump and start buttons at the same time.


- TECHNICAL -


The upright Dig Dug machine came in the same cabinet as several other Atari titles (such as "Kangaroo" and "Centipede"). The machine was decorated mostly with cartoon graphics showing scenes from the game, superimposed over a yellow background.


There was also a cocktail version. It had 2 control panels (one on each end). Each panel had a 'Pump' button on either side of the joystick, so left handed players can play equally well. This model used a 13inch monitor (as opposed to the standard 19inch in the upright), and the game image flipped for each players turn. The top glass is decorated with some cutesy pictures of Fygar, Pooka and Dig Dug.

- TRIVIA -


Released in April 1982.

Licensed to Atari (May 1982). Approximately 12,200 units were produced by Atari.


Introduced in 1982, Dig Dug was a shining addition to the golden age of video games. Dig Dug's charming world and innovative game play made it an instant classic.


The main character of Dig Dug has a name in Japan, 'Taizo Hori', a pun based on the phrase 'Horitai zo', or 'I want to dig!'. He is believed to be the father of "Mr. Driller".


* A place in video game history : During the golden age of video games we saw a lot of novel approaches to gaming, said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "Tempest", for instance, required things of its players that we'd never seen in a video game before. You had to learn a whole new set of skills to further the game experience. Dig Dug is another game that provided a novel approach. The types of movement you had to learn, the skills you had to develop, were like none other up until that point. And this game play was combined with a really engaging subject matter, which was this guy, Dig Dug, who digs around underground after subterranean monsters, and who explodes them with a really bizarre weapon, an air pump! There was just this string of interesting, engaging things for the viewer to look at and experience while dealing with this new type of game. It really captured, and still captures, the imagination. The sounds in Dig Dug are also really distinctive. When people hear that music start to play here at the museum, they'll laugh with recognition. It's quite funny watching people play that game.


* The great 25-cent escape : Lindsey enjoys seeing visitors to his museum discover a video game that rekindles memories from earlier years.

"They'll say, 'Wow, I used to be great at this!' And then they'll adopt their old game-playing position -- which seems to vary almost randomly from person to person," Lindsey said. "They drop a token in, start rolling, and then they will lose all sense of time and space, becoming completely immersed in the game. Often they'll start laughing. I had a guy yesterday who was so funny. He came in and had obviously played these video games quite a bit in years past, like many of us did. He wandered around the museum, going from game to game, and he just laughed hysterically as he remembered all the little details of each game that he had spent so much time on, so long ago."


* Namco notes After the release of Dig Dug in 1982, Namco engineers went to arcades to watch their new game being played. They noticed that "there were two completely separate groups of people. One group enjoyed blowing the enemy up with the pump. The other group enjoyed beating the enemy by dropping rocks on them".


Dig Dug was NOT the first game that Atari licensed from Namco, as is common belief. That honor goes to F-1, the ''3-D'' racing game that projected a race track on a screen using a rolling film. Hardly anybody in Atari coin-op liked Dig Dug except for Brian McGhie (who later joined Starpath) and Owen Rubin. It was McGhie who added the finishing touches to Dig Dug. Rubin still owns an upright prototype cabinet of Dig Dug with hand-drawn artwork, and still considers it one of his favorite games of all time.


Donald Hayes holds the official record for this game with 4,595,010 points on January 27, 2008.


A bootleg of this game is known as "Zig Zag". Another bootleg running on the "Galaxian" hardware was made by LAX as "Zigzag".


A Dig Dug unit appears in 1983 min movie 'WarGames'.


Former Atari game designer Owen Rubin owns an upright prototype of Dig Dug with hand-drawn art. The ROMs in his prototype are the actual production ROMs.


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Video Game Music - YLC-20003) on 25/04/1984.

Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The Best Of Video Game Music - 32XA-66) on 25/04/1986.


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".


- UPDATES -


The background graphics are slightly different in the Atari version, the earth is less regular.


The Sidam version skips the first 3 layouts and starts with the layout of Round 4.


- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is relatively complicated due the dirt layer a monster is at and also how you kill said monster. In addition, you even get points for 'eating' dirt.


* Over-inflating (bursting) monsters :

Layer 1 : Pooka - 200 Points

Layer 1 : Fygar - 400 Points

Layer 2 : Pooka - 300 Points

Layer 2 : Fygar - 600 Points

Layer 3 : Pooka - 400 Points

Layer 3 : Fygar - 800 Points

Layer 4 : Pooka - 500 Points

Layer 4 : Fygar - 1000 Points


NOTE : If you over-inflate a Fygar vertically, you only will get 1/2 the listed points (same points as a Pooka on that layer). This is due to the fact you aren't risking your life dealing with Fygar's flame breath.


* Dropping rocks on monsters :

1 Crushed : 1000 Points

2 Crushed : 2500 Points

3 Crushed : 4000 Points

4 Crushed : 6000 Points

5 Crushed : 8000 Points

6 Crushed : 10000 Points

7 Crushed : 12000 Points

8 Crushed : 15000 Points


* You get points for collecting the prizes :

Round 1 - Carrot : 400 Points

Round 2 - Rutabaga : 600 Points

Round 3 - Mushroom : 800 Points

Round 4 & 5 - Cucumber : 1000 Points

Round 6 & 7 - Eggplant : 2000 Points

Round 8 & 9 - Bell Pepper : 3000 Points

Round 10 & 11 - Tomato : 4000 Points

Round 12 & 13 - Onion : 5000 Points

Round 14 & 15 - Watermelon : 6000 Points

Round 16 & 17 - Galaxian : 7000 Points

Round 18 and + - Pineapple : 8000 Points


When you are digging a new tunnel, you get 10 points per 5/8 inch dug.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hints for Game Play :

Get many monsters to follow you. Then dig a long vertical tunnel up to a rock. Drop the rock by digging right or left.

Dig Dug may take extra time to turn. It is better to start turning early than to wait until the last second.

Destroy monsters at bottom dirt level for more points.

Use PUMP to stun monsters. Then you may escape or walk through them.

Don't stop next to Fygar when he is in a cave. His fire can go through a thin layer of dirt and destroy you.

A vegetable appears after 2 rocks have been dropped. So be sure to drop two rocks in each round.


* When you start the game, Dig Dug will dig a downward vertical shaft into a chamber. The floor of this chamber is the top of the third layer. It is your job to dig tunnels and keep the monsters busy. This won't be an easy task since the monsters will attempt to surround Dig Dug and permanently end his mining career. You will have a two second delay before the round starts. It shows Dig Dug digging his vertical tunnel down to his starting area. Take this time to see where all the monsters are and figure out the best course of action to take them out.


* Knowing the behavior of the monsters is a crucial element of this game. Pookas travel a bit faster then Dig Dug and tend to run him down. Fygars don't have the speed but they make up for it with their fiery belch.


* Dig Dug travels slower when he is busy carving tunnels.


* Know the rules of dropping rocks :

1) Rocks will wobble for about a second before they drop.

2) Rocks drop immediately when you cut a horizontal tunnel under them.

3) In vertical tunnels, the rock will stay in place as long as Dig Dug is facing it and moving.

4) When you drop two rocks, the prize will appear.


* Don't waste your rocks on only one monster. Try to get as many monsters crushed as possible. The best way to accomplish this is :

1) Try to dig long, vertical tunnels under the rocks. Don't dig all the way to the rock or you will waste it.

2) Try to get the monsters to follow you. Sort of a ''follow the leader'' type thing up that vertical tunnel. This will be especially important in the later rounds.

3) If the monsters are spread out a little, do a couple of pumps on the monster that is close. This will only stun it and allow the others to catch up.

4) Right before they get Dig Dug, dig the rest of the way then head off left or right. The long, vertical shaft will prevent their escape and get you big points.


* There are a total of 15 unique layouts in the game. After level 15, layouts 12-15 repeat over and over in waves of four. There are patterns for these levels. Also, after level 36, all of the enemies will speed up. The game does not award extra man after 900,000 points; the score will simply flip over at 1,000,000. It is very easy to get a score of 999,990 by eating dirt for ten points per section. At level 256, the game begins with a Pooka on top of the player character. Since there is no way to escape, the game is basically over, no matter how many lives the player may have left.


* Avoid killing the monsters by bursting them. If you don't have a choice, try to do in the lower layers since you get more points that way.


* The pump is better utilized as a delay mechanism. Inflating a monster with two pumps will immobilize it for about two seconds. With two monsters, you can pump one up, move back a little and pump the other one up.


* Monsters can be released from their pens in one of two ways :

1) You open up their pen by digging it open.

2) They turn into 'ghosts'. While they are ghosts, Pookas appear only as goggles, and Fygars appear as a set of evil eyes and a mouth. They will rematerialize as soon as they get into a tunnel.


* Watch out for the fiery breath of Fygar. They not only can let loose down a horizontal tunnel, they also can send their fire through thin layers of dirt. The best defense when caught in a horizontal tunnel with a Fygar is to immediately go up or down to avoid their breath.


* The Pookas have a tendency to try to surround Dig Dug. Usually they will try to trap him from the front and behind. Watch the Pooka 'ghosts' to make sure that they are not heading toward an area that you are currently tunneling in.


* It is possible to find patterns for the different levels, but it also is difficult since there isn't a well-defined maze to work with (like in "Pac-Man").


* When there is one monster left, it will attempt to escape rather then continue to pursue Dig Dug. You can chase him to get the points or let him go. Regardless, the game will advance to the next round.


* In the later rounds, it is much more profitable to collect the fruit then try to drop rocks on the monsters since they move so quickly.


* 'Eat Dirt' secret : You should try this before round 36 since everything speeds up.

1) Get the game down to two Pookas. If you only leave one, it will escape thus ending the round.

2) This works best in horizontal tunnels under the rocks.

3) Get a Pooka to follow you, inflate as necessary to delay him a little.

4) Right when you are next to the rock, inflate the Pooka once to just delay him. When he moves at your character again, move under the rock.

5) Quickly turn around and start pumping the Pooka up. Using the delay of the rock dropping, you should be able to cause the Pooka to burst at the same time the rock drops on him.

6) If you are successful, then the other Pooka will disappear and you can amuse yourself digging out tunnels all day long in the dirt. To return the game back to normal, drop another rock and you will go into the next round.


* Easter Egg :

1) Enter service mode.

2) Keep B1 pressed and enter the following sequence : Up(x6), Right(x3), Down(x4), Left(x8).

3) '(c) 1982 NAMCO LTD.' will appear on the screen.

Dig Dug II (c) 1985 Namco.


For this sequel to the 1982 classic, "Dig Dug", Namco changed the game's perspective from a sideways viewpoint, to an overhead one. Action now takes place on a series of small islands.


The gameplay itself retains much from its predecessor, with players still armed with a pump that allows them to inflate and burst the enemies. For this sequel, however, Namco also introduced ground-based charges. Players can activate the charges in order to join them up with other charges, represented on screen by the appearance of trenches. Once a line of charges is linked to two of the island's edges, the charges will detonate and destroy a piece of the island, killing any enemies that happen to be standing on the piece when it's destroyed. Players must be careful not to be standing on a piece that is destroyed, or they themselves will be killed.

Digger (c) 06/1980 Sega.


Digger is a game that requires you to dig strategically placed holes within a maze format so you can capture and fill in over the invading creatures before they can attack and destroy your man. The maze format changes with every round played.


The creatures are confined behind a wall. In the first of three rounds of game play, four creatures are let out of the holding area through a gate. You must conquer these four before advancing to the next round, where you face six creatures. Your third round has you battling eight creatures. This process is repeated and the point value increased with each three-round victory. Also, creatures' speed increases each round. Any contact at all with the creatures will be fatal to your man.


While you are busy digging holes and entrapping creatures, the rest are behind the retaining wall scurrying back and forth. After about three minutes, the gates at each end will open and all of the remaining creatures will stream into the play area at once. However, a skillful player will conquer all of the creatures of each round and the gate will not be a threat.

The point value per creature increases with each three-round phase.

The first phase awards 300 points per creature, decreasing to 100 points if not filled over promptly.

The second phase awards 500 points per creature, decreasing to 300 points.

The third phase awards 700 points, decreasing to 500 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* A double score bonus is awarded if you capture and fill in over the RED creature before any of the GREEN ones. But, this must be the FIRST creature defeated, or the RED creature becomes GREEN and no bonus is awarded.


* A 1000 points bonus is given if you capture four creatures in a row at full point value during any one round.


* When a creature is captured, 8 squeaking sounds are heard before the creature escapes from the hole. 5 squeaks are required to cover a creature, so you must hurry to the hole and Fill before the 4th squeak, or the creature will emerge and devour your man.

Discs of Tron [Environmental model] (c) 1983 Bally Midway.


As Tron, you fling discs at Sark in an attempt to knock him off his platform. Knocking off Sark will advance you to the next level. Other levels vary the level and number of platforms to jump between.


- TECHNICAL -


Discs of Tron [Environmental model] is huge, weighing in at over 700 pounds. The game was often sawed in 2 to make it easier to move. The cabinet, though it looks like it should come apart, does not (the roof and floor boards span both halves of the cabinet).


The environmental is called such because it attempts to replicate the environment that your character on the screen is experiencing. The player stands inside the cabinet on a disc, and lights around the disc flash when your character dies (just like on screen). The surround sound replicates the sounds of discs that whiz by your character.


- TRIVIA -


Released in March 1983.


Also released as "Discs of Tron [Upright model]".


Discs of Tron was originally designed to be a part of the original "Tron" coin-op, but was cut out at the end and set aside for refinement and release as a stand-alone coin-op in its own right.


Discs of Tron is inspired by the short sequence in the movie (Tron, 1982 Disney) where the character Flynn beats another trapped program and eventually 'derezzes' him, and when Tron is introduced, beating four 'computer players' very early in the movie.


David Bagenski holds the official record for this game with 418,200 points on June 28, 1986.

Released in March 1983.


Also released as "Discs of Tron [Environmental model]".


Discs of Tron was originally designed to be a part of the original "Tron" coin-op, but was cut out at the end and set aside for refinement and release as a stand-alone coin-op in its own right.


Discs of Tron is inspired by the short sequence in the movie (Tron, 1982 Disney) where the character Flynn beats another trapped program and eventually 'derezzes' him, and when Tron is introduced, beating four 'computer players' very early in the movie.


David Bagenski holds the official record for this game with 418,200 points on June 28, 1986.


A Discs of Tron 'prototype' machine was shown at the 2003 classic arcade games show 'California Extreme' in San Jose, California.

Do! Run Run (c) 1984 Universal.


A superb final entry into the "Mr Do!" series (not counting the Neo Geo-based "Neo Mr. Do", which was merely a remake of the first game in the series), "Do! Run Run" takes its inspiration from Namco's "Pac-Man".


As in his previous games, Mr Do! must once again collect coloured dots and/or fruit while avoiding or killing a number of enemies. For the fourth Mr Do! outing, Universal ditched the sideays viewpoint of the series' previous games and switched to an overhead perspective. This allowed the game to give an impression of 'depth', with slopes and steps affecting Mr Do!'s mobility and speed.


Mr. Do. has two items at his disposal with which he can kill the his enemies. The first is the 'Powerball', which featured in the original 'Mr. Do!' but was dropped from the first two sequels. The Powerball can be shot directly at an enemy to kill it instantly.


The second offensive option is provided in the form of the large wooden logs that litter the levels. These work in the same way as the apples did in the original game, and can be pushed free of their supporting struts, causing them to roll down the screen and kill everything in their path, including Mr. Do. himself if he strays too near.


As Mr Do! moves around a screen, he trails a line behind him. Players can join the two ends of the line up to form a rectangle (in a similar fashion to Taito's 1981 classic, "Qix") which will change any dots within the rectangle into cherries. A second rectangle can be drawn around the cherries which in turn will change them into apples. This can be repeated twice more, changing apples into lemons, and lemons into pineapples. The better the fruit, the more bonus points Mr Do! will earn when he collects them.

- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "Super Pierrot".


Because of the video game crash of 1983, Universal decided to release their final Mr. Do! game as a conversion kit only, because the market for dedicated cabinets had all but dried up at this point (but it was a full kit that would fit any cabinet, not just a kit for other Mr. Do! games). This kit is fairly rare, and is almost impossible to find today. The kit contained a new PCB and new graphics for the machine, the graphics were purple themed, and the marquee had a 'DO! Run Run' logo superimposed over a purple geometric landscape with a blue line running randomly about it.


Bootleggers ported this title to the very similar "Mr. Do's Castle" hardware, although that version is fairly rare.


Adam Mastromarino of Bristol, England holds the official record for this game with 1,605,100 points on September 16, 1984.


- UPDATES -


The maze graphics are slightly different than the Japanese version.

Free credit diamond : 8,000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* You can kill a baddie with your ball or by log-rolling him. Save the ball for emergencies and use the logs as much as possible.


* It takes 16 dots to regain your ball after you throw it.


* Each bounce of your ball against a wall increases the points you can get if it hits a baddie, up to 3000 pts max. Somewhere on every board, is hidden a 'letter', that when surrounded by your path, will bring out the 'E-X-T-R-A' guy if you step on it.  It changes as time passes so use this to get the letters you need to come out so you can spell extra as fast as possible.


* The extra guy will also come out if you kill or log-roll enough baddies. If you use the hidden letter and a log, you should be able to get 2 EXTRA letters per level. This will earn you more free Mr. Do!s as fast as possible because the higher levels will get tough.


* Stepping on an EXTRA letter will not only bring out the EXTRA guy and his entourage, but the baddies on the level will slow down to half speed. This makes it easy to avoid them while you lure the EXTRA and his ghosts under a log. 


* Use the logs as much as possible. They kill the most guys with a single log to get the most points. If you can lure 3 or 4 baddies into the path of a log, they will not move out of the way once the log is pushed and you kill them easily. Walking under a log knocks out the post holding them up so get out of the way if you do that. You do not have to push the log from above to get it moving.


* A log will also roll if it is hit by a flaming/flying snake/dragon. Be aware of this so you don't get crushed!


* A level ends once you get all the baddies (or get all the dots). Use this to your advantage. If a log is going to run over the last baddie, let it run into you too. If all the baddies are in line with a log, you can start it rolling, let it roll you and then the baddies will freeze in place for the log to roll them too. Your life will be restored at the end of the level if you get all the baddies!


* Mr. Do! slows down going up a step and speeds up when going down them. Use this to your advantage if you are being chased. The baddies don't speed up going downhill so you have the advantage.


* Don't waste your time gathering dots or surrounding them to get pineapples. There are more points in log-rolling and multi-bounce hits of your ball. Collect dots only to restore your ball or expose the EXTRA letter. You should be able to get about 20,000 points per level using the above techniques.


* Try to make concentric circle patterns from the outermost edge in, 'eating' the outermost cherries, dots or whatever each time. This will allow you to get a ton of pineapples, which score the most, and will get you a good score in early stages before it gets difficult.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Bee Medals : There are bee medals hidden in the whole game. If you shoot where a bee medal is hidden, it starts to blink. Then you will need to use your laser to free it, before you can collect the medal.


* Hits : There is a combo score system for hits within a specific time range. If it takes too long for your next hit, the chain breaks and counting restarts.


* Hidden 1up player : In stage 3 is your one and only chance to pick up a 1up item. It is hidden in the giant red spaceship you will pass later in the stage. To get it, open all 6 side-boxes with your laser, before you destroy the main tower in the center of the ship. You are not allowed to use your smartbomb for these actions. Otherwise the 1up item would not appear in the ruins of the tower afterwards.


* Bomb Stock : If you don't use the smartbombs and keep the stock display at 'maximum' bonus multiplier will be 2x.


* Flower bloom : There are a few places in the game you will meet flowers growing in ruins. If you fly near them they will bloom. This is more than just a joke of the graphic artist. It can reward you with a nice bonus score :

(each) flower blooming : 10 points per 1/60 sec.

+ your shots hit it : 510 points per bullet

+ your laser crosses it : 1'100 points per 1/30 sec.


* Second loop : To access the second (harder) loop thus being able to fight against Hibachi, the 'true' final boss after level 6 boss, you have to complete the first 6 levels with only ONE credit AND meet at least one of these conditions :

- Don't lose more than 2 fighters (lives). 

- Depending on the fighter, have a maximum hit count of at least : 

Type A : 270 hits 

Type B : 300 hits 

Type C : 330 hits 

- At least 50 million points by the end of level 6. 

- Collect ALL 13 bees in four of the 6 areas using the tactic explained above for 'bee medals'.

Domino Man (c) 1982 Bally Midway.


The player controls Domino Man, a bespectacled, moustachioed artist who must set up a chain of giant dominoes across the screen, to form a chain of dominoes which can then be toppled.


The dominoes must be placed on sites marked by black spots, achieved by simply running over each spot. Once all of the spots are covered with a domino, the chain is complete. The player will then have the choice of either knocking them all down to clear the level, or simply wait for a few seconds to continue to the next screen, in hope of completing the chain on THAT level, and so on. In this way, the player can set up several chains and knock them all down in one fell swoop, earning many bonus points in the process. Multiple chains are, of course, very difficult to achieve.


Domino Man's progress is hampered by a neighborhood bully who walks onto the screen and tries to knock over the first dominoes he comes across. The player must either try to complete and topple the chain of dominoes before the bully knocks them over, or hit the bully with a domino; causing the bully's trousers to fall down and disabling him for a few seconds. A killer bee also appears, and if it manages to sting the player, a life is lost. A bag lady and a boy pushing a shopping cart wander blindly around the levels, occasioanlly knocking over some of the dominoes. Domio Man can hit them, however, causing them to change direction.


Once a game is over, a poem is displayed on-screen to evaluate the player's performance on the game. For example :

Roses are red

Or so goes the verse,

You set up fifty-two

You could have done worse.


- TECHNICAL -


The game uses the standard Midway-style cabinet for that era. In addition to pictures of dominoes around the monitor, the lower front portion of the cabinet (around the coin door) sports several large vacu-molded plastic dominoes.

Donkey Kong (c) 1981 Nintendo.


An absolutely legendary arcade game in which the player takes on the role of Mario - who makes his debut in this game, and would go on to become a gaming legend - and must battle his way to the top of each level to rescue his beloved Pauline; who has been kidnapped by the evil giant ape, Donkey Kong.


Mario is controlled with a the joystick and the JUMP button and must jump over and avoid rolling Barrels thrown by Donkey Kong; jumping over Fireballs and Cement Pies and avoiding bouncing rivets as he traverses the levels; moving along ramps and conveyor belts and utilizing ladders and elevators. For additional points, Mario can collect Umbrellas, Hats, Purses and other bonus items that Pauline has dropped on her way to the top of the building. Mario can also grab a Hammer (by jumping up to it) to smash Barrels, Beams, Fireballs, Cement Pies, and Firefoxes which earn the player additional bonus points. The Hammer can only be used for a limited amount of time, however.


On the Ramp, Elevator and Conveyor Belt Stages, whenever Mario reaches Pauline, Donkey Kong will grab her and carry her off to the next higher level. But on the Rivet stage, Mario must remove all the rivets on each and every floor by running or jumping over them. After all the rivets are removed, Donkey Kong will fall head first onto a stack of girders and be knocked out and then Mario and Pauline will be together again for good. The game then starts over again with an increased difficulty level.


CAST OF CHARACTERS :


Mario - This is the one and only Mario who will go on to become one of the biggest video game stars of all time. This is the game that started it all for him. In this game, he is thought to be a carpenter instead of a plumber.


Pauline - Mario's girlfriend and damsel in distress. She is stuck at the top of each screen awaiting rescue from the clutches of Donkey Kong.


Donkey Kong - The most well-known video game monkey. Donkey Kong has kidnapped Pauline and carried her up to the top of the construction site that Mario is working at.


Hammer - Except for the Elevator Stage, 2 Hammers can be found on each stage. Jump to grab the Hammer and use it to smash nearby dangers for points. It only lasts for a short time and Mario cannot climb ladders while he is holding the Hammer.


Barrel - Donkey Kong throws these at Mario on the Ramp Stage. Many of them roll down the ramps and randomly drop down ladders that they pass. Sometimes Kong throws them directly down the building.


Beam - These are the blue Barrels that Kong throws. Other than color (the regular Barrels are orange), the only other difference between Barrels and Beams is that Beams will turn into Fireballs when they reach the burning oil can at the bottom.


Fireball - These appear on every stage except the Rivet Stage; on the Ramp Stage, one appears each time a Beam reaches the oil can. They move about randomly and can be jumped, but it's dangerous to try because they change directions frequently.


Firefox - These are the fire enemies that roam around the Rivet Stage. They are even harder to jump over and they seem to track Mario a little more closely.


Spring - These bounce along the roof of the Elevator Stage before falling down to the bottom of the screen creating a dangerous but predictable obstacle to avoid.


Cement Pies - The Cement Pies passively travel along the conveyor belt and are harmful to touch. The only danger they pose is when the conveyor belt suddenly changes directions.


Prizes - Some of Pauline's items (Purse, Hat, and Umbrella) litter the construction site and can be retrieved by Mario for bonus points. They appear on every stage except the Ramp Stage.


- TECHNICAL -


Donkey Kong machines came in one of 4 different cabinets. 2 flavors of upright machines, plus a cabaret, and a cocktail thrown in for good measure. The cocktails and cabarets were mostly black and woodgrain, and not excessively decorated. But the upright versions were. The red upright versions are actually "Radarscope" cabinets that have been factory-converted to Donkey Kong. These are fairly rare (even though they were supposed to be the only Donkey Kong machines), and feature slightly different gameplay. The blue uprights (which are the most common), are a very rectangular affair, with quite a lot of artwork. They have orange-ish sticker style side-art (with Mario and Kong on them), with control panel, marquee, and monitor bezel graphics to match. This game does not use a standard arcade monitor. It requires a 'Nintendo Compatible' monitor (a normal monitor will display the picture like that of a photographic negative). This simple little monitor change basically launched the entire Nintendo Vs. Unisystem later on. Because only Donkey Kong series games and Vs. titles would work on these monitors (forcing operators to buy conversion kits for those games instead of a competitors game).

- TRIVIA -


Released in July 1981.


The game was originally going to be called 'Monkey Kong' but, as with "Continental Circus", a mistake during the translation process from Japanese to English resulted in the now legendary name. The game's creator, the equally-legendary Shigiru Miyamoto denies this story to this day - claiming that the naming is deliberate as he wanted an animal name that would capture the 'stubborn' nature of the Kong character (as in 'stubborn as a mule'). Few within the industry believe this explanation, however.


Nintendo was sued by Universal Studios who said the Donkey Kong character infringed on the King Kong copyright. Nintendo's legal counsel, John Kirby of Latham & Watkins LLP, recalled an old case were the RKO Pictures sued Universal Studio for the same reason. At this time, Universal Studio had argued that King Kong was in the public domain. So, Universal Studio lost and had to pay Nintendo $1.8 million in damages. To thanks John Kirby, Nintendo created a personage with the name of Kirby (originally called Popopo).


Donkey Kong was to be Nintendo's first big breakthrough into the western - and particularly American - arcade scene. Before Donkey Kong, Nintendo was having difficulty establishing itself in these markets. After the game's massive success Nintendo quickly established their headquarters of Nintendo of America to ensure that the game was being distributed properly.


Donkey Kong introduced a number of wholly original game-play ideas to the platform genre. It was the first ever game to feature multiple play-fields, for example. It was also the first game that allowed players to jump over objects. Its creation came about due to the commercial failure of another game called "Radarscope". A consequence of which was an excess of redundant arcade cabinets. In an attempt to limit their losses, Nintendo commissioned Donkey Kong and history was made.


Mario was named after Mario Segali, the landlord of Nintendo of America's first warehouse location in Seattle (thought it was debated whether this occurred before or well after the game was released). Mario was originally called 'Jumpman'; only the arcade version of Donkey Kong has ever called the hero Jumpman; home ports proceeded to call the hero Mario. Accounts differ as to how Nintendo of America felt about the game before its release. Many sources claim that they all felt sure it would be an absolute disaster while others say they were more optimistic. Although Mario is a plumber in later games, his career in Donkey Kong is that of a carpenter. Mario's appearance (and consequently his career) was dictated by the primitive graphics hardware of the time - the only way to have his arms appear 'separate' to his torso was to have them as a different color - hence he wears 'dungarees'. The mustache is present merely to indicate where Mario's mouth is, again due to the low graphics resolution imposed by hardware limitations. Mario wears a hat so his head is distinguishable from the game's black backgrounds.


About 60,000 units were sold in the U.S. Oddly, despite it being one of the ten best selling games of the golden age of video games, it never reached #1 on Replay's popularity charts. Instead, it was stuck at #2 behind mega hits "Pac-Man" and "Ms. Pac-Man" - the two best selling games ever.


The 75m Stage (a.k.a. the Elevator Stage), is used as an unlockable stage in Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Nintendo Wii.


Billy Mitchell holds the official record for this game with 1,050,200 points on June 13, 2007.


Donkey Kong inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Do The Donkey Kong' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album.


A Donkey Kong unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1984 movie 'Gremlins' and in the 1985 movie 'The Heavenly Kid'.


MB (Milton Bradley) released a board game based on this video game (same name) in 1982. Save the girl and avoid the barrels and fireballs as in the video game. The gameboard is laid out like the video game's Ramp Stage. 'Can You Battle Donkey Kong And Save the Fair Maiden?'.


Donkey Kong also spawned a cartoon series of the same name : Ruby-Spears Productions. Produced by Joe Ruby, Ken Spears. Originally aired September 17, 1983 as part of 'Saturday Supercade' on CBS. Donkey Kong's voice was provided by actor/comedian Soupy Sales.


- UPDATES -


Originally both the US and Japanese versions asked us 'How high can you try?'. This was quickly grammatically corrected to ask the familiar 'How high can you get?'.


The game does end, as it has a 'kill screen'!. The timer in Level 22 expires so quickly, that the first stage cannot be completed.


A 'speed-up' kit was released disallowing barrels coming down the ladder if you were at the top of it (SEE TIP BELOW).


The Japanese version has all 4 stages displayed in their original, logical order 1-2-3-4.

For the US version they changed it to match the 'How high can you try/get?' theme. With the stage order as follows :

Level 01 : 1-4

Level 02 : 1-3-4

Level 03 : 1-2-3-4. 

Level 04 : 1-2-1-3-4

Level 05 : 1-2-1-3-1-4

Level 06 through Level 21 all remain the same as Level 05

Level 22 : 1 (Kill screen).


There is this text in one of the roms of the Japanese version :

CONGRATULATION !IF YOU ANALYSE DIFFICULT THIS PROGRAM,WE WOULD TEACH YOU.*****TEL.TOKYO-JAPAN 044(244)2151 EXTENTION 304 SYSTEM DESIGN IKEGAMI CO. LIM.


- SCORING -


Jumping over Barrels, Beams, Fireballs, Cement Pies, or Firefoxes :

1 item jumped : 100 points

2 items jumped : 300 points

3 or more items jumped : 500 points

* Due to a bug in the program, jumping 3 or more items displays onscreen 800 points but actually awards only 500 points.

* Sometimes jumping over one or more objects scores no points.

* Sometimes scoring can occur when objects are next to or behind the player when jumping (especially the Springs on the Elevator Stage).


Destroying objects with the hammer :

Barrels : 300 points

Beams, Fireballs, Cement Pies, and Firefoxes : 300, 500 or 800 points


Picking up the purse, hat, or umbrella :

Level 01 : 300 points

Level 02 : 500 points

Level 03 and above : 800 points


Running over a rivet : 100 points


Jumping close to Kong on Rivet Stage : 100 points 


When each level is completed, the player receives the points shown in the bonus box.

Starting bonus points :

Level 01 : 5000 points

Level 02 : 6000 points

Level 03 : 7000 points

Level 04 through Level 21 : 8000 points

Level 22 (kill screen) : 4000 points 

* The timer on level 22 behaves strangely. When the stage first comes onscreen, the timer reads 100. Then it changes to 4000 when Mario appears. It then counts down to 3700 and stays there for a few seconds, then Mario dies for no apparent reason, presumably due to a bug in the game's timer code.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, Mario will start at the oil can on the bottom level of the Ramp stage. Your job is to navigate him to the top so that he can progress to the next levels. Here are some strategies for each level...


* RAMP STAGE : This is the first stage of each level.

1) On Level 01, the Ramp Stage pretty easy. Donkey Kong will start the show by dropping a Beam into the oil can, igniting it. After a couple of seconds, a Fireball will jump out and dance about. Afterward, every eighth Barrel released by Donkey Kong will be a Beam. In the later levels, Donkey Kong will throw the first Beam diagonally toward the lower right corner. If you are running toward that ladder, you and the Beam may have an unexpected encounter. On the later levels, it's better to hesitate briefly, then start running so you can jump the Beam.

2) Donkey Kong releases a Barrel about every 2 seconds. This does not mean, however, that the Barrels will all come at you at a uniform rate. Some Barrels will fall down the ladders, whether they are broken or not, before reaching the end of a platform. This can cause the Barrels to bunch up in 2's, 3's, and even 4's. Be wary when attempting to jump too many Barrels since you don't have the horizontal range to jump too many.

3) Also remember to have enough overhead clearance when jumping Barrels. If Mario's head goes above the platform above, he may hit a Barrel rolling down that platform. This problem is especially true at the ends of the platforms.

4) In the later levels, the Barrels seem to go for Mario. To offset this a bit, go just a little past a ladder. The Barrel may drop giving you an opening at a ladder farther down the platform.

5) The Hammer can be either your greatest friend or your worst hindrance. It lasts anywhere from 5-7 seconds. Here are some hammering tips :

a) Remember, you cannot jump or climb ladders when you have the Hammer.

b) Be wary of trying to hammer Barrels that are close together. You will take out the first Barrel, but the second Barrel will get you when Mario is swinging the Hammer up. It's better to do a quick back and forth jog so that you can get the second Barrel.

c) If Mario stands at the end of a platform so the one above is right above his head, he can destroy Barrels before they drop to his level. Again, watch out for how much hammering time you have or a Barrel may drop on you right when your hammer goes away.

6) If there is a Barrel coming down the platform above and you are about ready to climb a ladder, wait for a moment. If you are on the ladder, the Barrel may decide to take a short cut and land on your head. This becomes more prevalent in the higher levels.

NOTE: On the Japanese version, a Barrel cannot drop down a ladder while Mario is on it.

7) As you proceed into the higher levels, Donkey Kong does not always play fair. He has a tendency to throw Barrels diagonally or even to drop them to the next platform. Be ready to expect the unexpected at the later levels.

8) Although the Fireballs on this stage are rather sedate, they still can pose a danger. If you take too long on the level, the Fireballs will eventually climb the ladders to higher platforms so it is important to move up quickly and safely.

7) On this and all stages, Mario can only survive falls at a distance no greater than his height..


* CONVEYOR BELT STAGE : A relatively easy stage. You just have to watch out for Fireballs and conveyer belts... 

1) The conveyer belts have a tendency to change direction very quickly. So if you are just under a ladder, you may find yourself being moved in the wrong direction. You may want to jump toward the ladder to reduce this chance. 

2) Watch out for the Cement Pies. They come up randomly and Mario will lose the battle if a Cement Pie hits him. The same goes for the Fireballs that are born from the oil can. 

3) If Mario goes off the edge of the screen on a conveyer belt he will lose that battle. 

4) Any platforms that have circles on one or both of the ends are conveyer belts. That means the very bottom and third platforms are not conveyer belts. Plan your strategy accordingly. 

5) Once you get up to the fourth platform, depending on what side you are on, you must make it to the telescoping ladders. You can hang on the ladder when it is retracted to avoid the Cement Pies. Just make sure there aren't any Fireballs around to harass you. Once the ladder extends to the next platform, climb it. 

6) On this level, you don't have to climb the ladder to the platform Pauline is on. All you have to do is make it to the platform that Donkey Kong is on. 


* ELEVATOR STAGE : Probably the hardest stage in the game. It's the one that players have the most trouble with... 

1) Mario will start out on the bottom of the leftmost girder. This level has a few hazards you must negotiate : 

a) The gaps between the girders. A sure hand and jump at the right place will prevent tragedy. 

b) The elevators themselves can be hazardous if you don't jump off in time. Mario will be caught in the gears either in the uppermost or lowermost girders. 

c) The Springs themselves are a hazard. If your timing is off, be prepared to have Mario squashed by a wayward Spring. 

2) There are two routes you can travel to get to the top : The upper and lower routes. All veteran Donkey Kong players know that the upper route is the best route but it takes a little skill. The reasons for the upper route are : 

a) You don't have as many jumps to make. 

b) If you take the lower route, you will have to cross the path of the Springs twice. Once while traveling on the first set of girders and again when you cross over on the second set of girders. 

c) These factors create a higher risk for Mario not to make it. 

3) To navigate the top route, do the following : 

a) Get on the first elevator (it is going up). When you almost get even with the top of the next girder to the right, jump onto it. If a Fireball is in the way, jump back to the top of the girder on the left (and pick up the Umbrella if you haven't done so yet). 

b) From the top of that girder, get ready to jump on the next elevator (it is going down). When the elevator is slightly higher then the girder Mario is standing on, jump onto it. Without breaking stride (in other words, keep running), jump again to the third set of girders. Mario will have a pretty good arc since you ran him constantly. You should land on the top or second level of that girder. 

4) Climb the ladder onto the girder that Donkey Kong is standing on and don't move. Mario will be right on the edge of that girder. The Springs will get very close to Mario (basically shaving his nose) but they won't hit him. 

5) When a Spring basically scrapes Mario's nose, take off running toward the ladder to the platform with Pauline. This trick will require some timing. Run a little past that ladder then immediately turn around and go up the ladder. If this trick is done correctly, Mario will follow the Spring that just bounced over him and beat the Spring right behind it. This trick works on the later levels even when the Springs are 'double-jumping'. 

6) This stage requires practice to perfect your techniques. Fortunately, in the American version, there is only one Elevator Stage per level after Level 03. Remember, Mario cannot survive long falls.


* RIVET STAGE : This is final stage of each level. However, it is probably one of the easiest stages to go through...

1) There is no real pattern to taking out the rivets holding the girders. What you must really be wary of are the Firefoxes. At the later levels, the Firefoxes move quite a bit faster and they become more aggressive.

2) One tactic is to get on one side of the rivet. Right as a Firefox gets right next to Mario, jump backward over the rivet. You will gain 100 points and remove the rivet. Firefoxes cannot cross the gap created by the missing rivet.

3) Make sure you don't accidentally jump into Donkey Kong when you are on the upper platform. This will lead to a premature end for Mario really quickly.

4) You can jump into the side walls away from the girders and they will bounce you back onto the girder you were on. This move is usually for if you are surrounded by Firefoxes and there is nowhere left to go.

Donkey Kong 3 (c) 1983 Nintendo.


The 3rd and final arcade outing for Donkey Kong sees the giant ape once again cast as the enemy. Unlike the first 2 Kong games, the legendary character Mario doesn't feature, with the player taking on the role of 'Stanley', a gardener who is armed with a bug spray with which he must destroy the swarms of insects that attack Stanley and try to steal his plants.


Each level has five plants that must be protected. Stanley must also spray Kong to force the ape to the top of the screen and complete the level.


CAST OF CHARACTERS : 


Stanley - Stanley's job is to defend the greenhouse that Donkey Kong has invaded. He does this with his trusty bug spray. When Stanley pumps his spray can, the spray travels a certain distance before dissipating so it's not useful against targets that are far away. Stanley primarily uses his bug spray to zap bugs or to make Donkey Kong scoot up the vines that he holds onto. In order to complete each stage, Stanley's goal is to either push Donkey Kong all the way up the vine using bug spray, or defeat every insect present in that stage. There are many ways for Stanley to lose a life, including touching an insect, getting shot by any of the bee stingers, running out of time, or allowing Donkey Kong to slip off the bottom of the vine. 


Donkey Kong - Nintendo's favorite simian seems to have been working out a little bit compared to his previous appearances. Donkey Kong attempts to keep himself above harm's way by hanging on to two vines that descend from the greenhouse ceiling. If left alone, Donkey Kong slips down the vines little by little, hoping to land on Stanley by surprise. Occasionally, he will reach over to one of the two beehives along side him and tap them in order to send more bees after Stanley. In the yellow stages, he even grabs coconuts from time to time and lobs them at Stanley's head. Starting in round 15, he will throw coconuts at you regardless of the stage. 


Super Spray - One time for every one of Stanley's lives, a more powerful bug spray will be perched on Donkey Kong's right vine. When Stanley pushes Donkey Kong high enough so that his hand is touching the spray, the spray falls to the ground, at which time Stanley can pick it up. The Super Spray lasts for a number of seconds, and continues with Stanley to the next stage until the full time runs out. When this spray is activated, Donkey Kong is forced up the vines much faster, Creepies die when hit, and Queen Bees die in one hit. It will not be replenished after it runs out until Stanley loses a life, so it's not a good idea to plan your strategy around it's use. 


Beespy & Buzzbee - These bugs are the primary attack force of the hive. Stanley starts the game squaring off against the Beespies as they swoop down and try to steal Stanley's vegetables. Starting in round 12, the hive switches to their faster and more aggressive soldier, the Buzzbees. Buzzbees strike at Stanley more directly than Beespies. Either bee may or may not be accompanying a Queen Bee, but they are dangerous either way. 


Queen Bees - Starting in round 3, the Queen Bees of the hive will from time to time enter the fray surrounded by their royal escorts. One shot isn't enough to do them in, it simply changes them from red to blue. Even after you shoot them a second time, the threat isn't over. When killed, they split up in to 4 tiny projectiles that can kill you if the connect. You are only safe directly beneath them when they die. 


Buttifly & Beetle - Starting in round 6, the Buttiflies escape from the hive. They fly down along the side of the screen until they are even with Stanley, pause for a brief moment, and then charge across the screen in an attempt to collide with him. They disappear after round 16, only to be replaced with Beetles in round 18, who are bigger and a bit harder to dodge. Beetles do not pause as Buttiflies do, and attack immediately. 


Moth - The Moth is the mercenary of the bee hive, employed from round 24 and on. They move erratically, so it's slightly difficult to predict where they are going to end up. They will occasionally attack Stanley, or they will swoop down for his vegetables. Don't let them distract you from your efforts to force Donkey Kong up the vine, but don't get in their way either, or let them fly away with your plants. 


Creepy - This worm likes to play interference. In the blue and gray stages, he crawls down to the platforms from the plants along the side of the screen. Once he reaches the platform, he will wiggle back and forth and make a nuisance of himself. He cannot be killed by the normal bug spray, but he is quite allergic to it, and spraying him causes him to stop in his tracks until he finishes coughing. He can be persuaded to climb back up the plant for a while if you blast him with spray before he reaches the platforms. In yellow stages, three or more Creepies will slide along the vines below Donkey Kong and try to get in the way of your bug spray. If you hit one, not only with it absorb the spray, but you'll have to wait for it to finish coughing before he will move on and allow you to shoot Kong. They can be killed by super spray. 


Beebomb - After an insect successfully steals one of your plants, it turns into a Beebomb. Beebombs circle around a few times near the hive that they came from, and then immediately dive bomb towards Stanley. They are incredibly fast when diving towards you, but due to their direct attack nature, they are easy to defeat as long as you keep your eyes on them and time a blast of bug spray just as they are about to hit you. 


Vine Eater - These creatures appear when the bonus timer runs out. When the timer reaches zero, two of these appear on either side of the screen. They are oblivious to bug spray. When they reach the vines, they eat the vine from the bottom up to the ceiling. If they eat the section of vine that Donkey Kong is holding on to, Donkey Kong falls down and Stanley loses a life just as if he had allowed Donkey Kong to drop off the vine himself.

- TRIVIA -


Released in October 1983, Donkey Kong 3 was Nintendo's 3rd arcade featuring the hapless ape.


This game came out at the time of the big arcade game collapse. Companies such as Atari, Konami, and Taito saw a drastic reduction in sales for their arcade machines. Smaller arcade companies such as Centuri (producer of "Pleiades" and "Phoenix") simply went out of business. Although some notable games such as "Cloak and Dagger", "Track and Field", and "Elevator Action" were released, none of them had strong sales. Donkey Kong 3 was no exception to what was going on.


First of all, Donkey Kong 3 changed the look of their game. Second, Instead of Mario, they now used Stanley the Exterminator (This is the only Nintendo game to feature the character of Stanley). Unfortunately, Donkey Kong 3 was not well received at the arcades and did pretty poorly in sales. It did develop a cult of games who remained loyal to the Donkey Kong series, but it never offered any serious competition.


Dwayne Richard holds the official record for this game with 2,583,000 points on September 21, 2008.


A bootleg was made by Kazutome in 1984 on the "Donkey Kong Junior" hardware!


- SCORING -


Beespy : 100 points

Buttifly : 200 points

Buzzbee : 300 points

Insect with Plant : 400 points

Beetle : 700 points

Beebomb : 700 points

Moth : 700 points


NOTE: Killing an insect with a plant will rescue the plant.


The Queen Bee's scoring depends on how many Beespies or Buzzbees are escorting her :

Queen Bee with no escorts : 400 points

Queen Bee with one escort : 700 points

Queen Bee with two escorts : 1000 points


Creepy : 300 points (can only be killed with Super Spray) 


You get 500 points per plant saved. If you save all the plants in consecutive levels, you get the following bonus :


First two consecutive levels (at this point, plants are not all full size) : 2000 points.


Third consecutive level onward (saving all plants after all 5 have grown to full size) : 5000 points.


If you lose a plant, you will get no plant bonus. Afterward you'll have to grow a new plant, resetting the plant bonus to 2000.


You also get the remaining bonus points added to your score when you complete a level. The bonus points start off at 8000.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, Stanley will start at the bottom, middle of the screen. You job is to move him up to push Donkey Kong out of the area and to defend against the various insects that will plague Stanley. Using the joystick, you can easily navigate on the platforms as long as there is a platform above and below Stanley. Use this ability to maneuver to keep out of harms way.


* Your big goal is to prevent the insects from getting all of your plants. If you lose all of your plants, you lose the game. If you do happen to lose a plant, it takes two levels to grow another one.


* Some players use this to their advantage in order to increase their scores. They let the insect capture the plant, then they shoot the insect to get both the plant and insect bonus. In addition, they collect the bonus for having all five plants at the end of the stage.


* When using the regular bug spray, you will have to go to the top of the platformed area and jump up to force Donkey Kong higher while defending yourself against the insects.


* Keep in mind, that the bug spray you start with is pretty weak; both in terms of range and power. Your immediate goal is to get Donkey Kong far enough up the ropes so that the super-bug spray can gets dropped. This will enable you to hit him from the bottom of the platforms and give you more running room to avoid the insects. Keep in mind, this super-bug spray only last for that stage.


* The above will be especially crucial during the yellow stages. The bug spray merely causes the Creepies to choke and cough and it doesn't kill them. Instead, you may end up creating a wall of choking Creepies that block your line of fire from Donkey Kong. Make sure you fire in-between the four rows of Creepies.


* You will note that on the gray stages, there is no middle level, per se. Instead, you must work your way around to the right or left to get to the top platform. This delay could prove crucial since you will have to be very wary of the insects that will have had a head start on you.


* In the yellow stages, Donkey Kong likes to throw coconuts down on Stanley. There is a pattern to his throwing. He will first throw one to the left, then one to the center, then one to the right. The left and right coconuts that are thrown are aimed at the beehives, which will release a Beespy or Buzzbee.


* In the later levels, after 18, for the blue and gray stages, the pattern is a little different regarding the coconut throwing. Donkey Kong will throw a coconut to the right, then the left, then to the center.


* As you progress further into the levels, the insects become faster and more aggressive. As a matter of fact, after level 15, their shots are much more accurate when they shoot at Stanley. Also, the insects that don't shoot will home in on Stanley. This will require good joystick control if you are to survive.


* Be aware that the Queen Bees explode into shrapnel when killed. Four pieces will radiate downward.  Most of the time, if you are centered under them, the shrapnel will go around Stanley. If you are moving, though, be aware that even though you killed the Queen Bee, you will still have to deal with the aftermath.


* Watch for patterns on the blue and gray stages. The bees have a pattern when they swarm from their hives and come down to attack. Even on the later levels, when extra bees are involved in the attack, they still show patterns. Use this to your advantage.

Donkey Kong Junior (c) 1982 Nintendo.


Something of a role reversal for this superb sequel to the seminal 1981 platform-based original, with Mario now cast as the villain (the only Mario game in which this occurred) and Donkey Kong the captured victim.


Donkey Kong's son, DK Junior, must rescue his captured father from Mario's clutches by climbing and jumping his way over vines, chains and platforms before he can reach his father. Junior has to race against time while avoiding the horrible Snap Jaws, Nitpickers, and Sparks released by Mario.


Like the original, Donkey Kong Junior features 4 different stages, but in the US version, one or both of the middle stages are omitted in the first 3 levels. In the Japanese versions, all 4 stages are played in their logical order. See Updates below for complete details.


CAST OF CHARACTERS :


Donkey Kong Junior - The baby ape in the white unitard with a big J printed on the front, this is the son of Donkey Kong and he must rescue his father from Mario's cage.


Mario - This game is quite possibly the ONLY game in Mario's long history where he is the enemy.


Donkey Kong - Poor DK was captured by Mario after the events portrayed in Donkey Kong. Now he must helplessly watch as his son comes to the rescue.


Snapjaws - These mechanical mouths must be avoided. Blue Snapjaws will drop down a vine and continue to fall off the screen, while Red Snapjaws will climb back up a vine and pose a more permanent threat.


Nitpickers - There are two types of Nitpickers in the game. Small Nitpickers appear on the Springboard Stage and occasionally drop eggs on Junior as they fly around the top branch. Large Nitpickers appear on the Chains stage and weave back and forth in an attempt to hinder Junior's chances at rescuing his father.


Sparks - These volts of electricity patrol the Mario's Hideout Stage. The red variety follows the loop that they begin on while the blue version follows the vertical strips from one level to the next as they drop to the bottom of the screen.


Fruit - Junior will find various pieces of fruit scattered throughout each stage that he will pluck when he touches them. The fruit will fall and take out any enemy in its path until it reaches the bottom of the screen. They are one of the best sources for bonus points.


Keys - On the Chains Stage, Junior must push 6 of these up a chain into the lock positioned at the top of the stage. When he does, Papa will be set free.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, Junior will start at the bottom left corner of the Vines stage. Your job is to navigate him to the top so that he can progress to the next levels. Here are some strategies for each level...


* VINES STAGE : This is the first stage of each level.

1) To start out, Junior must grab the vines above him, and climb up to one of the two ledges to his right. He can jump to the next vine from either ledge, where he must fall down to the tree top below. 

2) Carefully jump right from one tree top to the next before grabbing the fourth vine from the right. Climb up above the right ledge and maneuver Junior over to the far right vines. Climb up and onto the branch above. Jump over any Snapjaws that pose a threat and leap up to the higher section of the branch before leaping for the key and ending the stage. 

3) Along the way, the pear and apple fruit prizes should be plucked with ease, and if you have time, it pays in the early levels to eliminate any of the red Snapjaws since they won't come back. However, from L4 onward, they will regenerate at Mario's feet. The banana is in a precarious position and should only be plucked if time and safety permits.


* SPRINGBOARD STAGE : This stage earns it's name by hosting a springboard at the bottom of the screen. Its purpose is to provide Junior with a shortcut.

1) Ordinarily, Junior must jump on the springboard to reach the tree top on the opposite side. Then he must ride the moving platform to the right and climb up the chains beneath the pulley. He must step on to a ledge which is placed directly beneath the point that Small Nitpickers like to lay eggs, so watch out. Then he must jump to the left to reach the first hold. When the small platform is beneath him, he must drop down and let it carry him to the next hold which rises and falls. 

2) If Junior uses the springboard as a shortcut, he can move directly from the start to this small ledge by pressing the jump button at precisely the moment when he hits the springboard, and he will launch up to the small platform immediately. 

3) Junior can only jump up and grab the second hold when it is in its lowest position. Once he safely has it, he must reach left and grab the chains that extend below Papa. After pulling himself up, he must navigate through the gauntlet of Small Nitpickers to reach the chains on the right side, where he must climb up a little further to reach the branch. Jumping over the gap in the branch, and timing his jumps to ensure that he doesn't collide with any Small Nitpickers, he can reach the key and end the stage. 


* MARIO'S HIDEOUT :

1) The layout of this electrically-filled chamber is substantially simpler than the previous stages, but it poses an even greater threat. Not only are Sparks a danger to Junior's feet on the ground, they also pose a danger when they pass overhead. A nervous player may anxiously jump over a Spark only to realize too late that another spark was headed Junior's way above him. 

The route is simple, from the start, cross over to the right, climb up, cross back over to the left, climb up, cross once more to the right, climb up again, and finally back to the left in an effort to reach the key. 

2) While the Red Sparks remain in their loops, the Blue Sparks move from the top of the screen to the bottom, taking the blue vertical pathways along the way. In the beginning, a Blue Spark will randomly choose one of the four pathways beneath Mario, so cross below Mario with care. 

3) The fruit are easily plucked on each level, but nailing Sparks with them will take extra timing, and may put you in a bad position if you're not aware of your surroundings. 


* CHAINS STAGE : This is Junior's last chance to save Papa, so it's now or never.

1) Papa's cage is positioned above a set of locks, and the keys to those locks are located on chains directly below them. All Junior has to do is push those keys up in to the locks and grant Papa his freedom. 

2) Blocking his way will be stubborn Red Snapjaws and Large Nitpickers that Mario sends after Junior. The Large Nitpickers will fly from one end of the screen to the other before swooping down a level and reversing direction. 

3) Obviously it is faster for Junior to push up keys two at a time when the chance is available, but that exposes Junior to twice the danger as Red Snapjaws could be located on either chain at any given moment. So proceed with caution, and try to save the apples for the moments when the Red Snapjaws are located beneath them and can be done away with for bonus points. But from L4 onward, beware: as in the Vines Stage, Red Snapjaws will regenerate at Mario's feet.

3) Once Junior unlocks every lock, Papa will come tumbling down and mighty Junior will catch him before the game starts all over again from the Vines stage at a more difficult level.


* Slow Down : This trick is not really useful but it has a comical effect. On the Vines Stage, climb to the top of the two vines at the far right edge of the screen. Then, with one hand on each vine, push up against the top of the screen and hold the joystick forward. All of the action on the screen will slow to snail's pace until you release the joystick.


* Infinite Play : This trick allows player 1 to earn an infinite number of extra turns, at the expense of player 2's game. Player 1 just plays a normal game but each time player 2 has a turn he must perform a trick that costs him that turn and earns each player an extra turn. If player 2 can do the trick every time, player 1 will always have extra turns to play with and player 2 will always have at least one turn left to perform the trick the next time around. At the beginning of the Vines Stage, Junior appears on a platform in the lower left corner of the screen. Walk to the right edge of this platform, and move as far right as possible without falling off. Only Junior's heel should still be on the platform. Wait at the edge of the platform and watch for a Blue Snapjaw to come down the first vine to the right. As soon as the Snapjaw leaves the end of the vine to fall in the water, jump toward him. You should hit the Snapjaw at the same time it hits the water. If you timed your jump correctly, your turn will be over but both players will be awarded an extra turn. You can then play normally (as player 1) until player 2's turn comes up again and you must repeat the trick.

Double Dragon (c) 1987 Technos.


Martial arts masters and twin brothers Billy & Jimmy Lee (nicknamed Hammer & Spike in the U.S. arcade cabinet) must defeat the savage street gang known as the Black Warriors to rescue Billy's kidnapped girlfriend, Marian. Standing between the brothers and Marian are four huge, colorful and varied levels; each populated with a wide variety of thugs. Many of the game's enemies carry weapons (knives, baseball bats etc.) and should Billy or Jimmy manage to knock the weapons from the enemies' hands, the heroes can pick the weapons up and use them against the enemies.


Double Dragon was a huge success due to the many game-play innovations it brought to the genre (see TRIVIA for details), but it demonstrates its final moment of inspired genius at the very end of the game. Should both players still be alive after the final boss has been defeated, they will have to fight each OTHER. The winner of this fight will be the one who wins Marian's affections.


The Black Warriors is made up of six distinct warriors - plus Willy, the game's final boss - and each is different from the others in both physical appearance and fighting style. As such, the game-play never feels repetitive. The members of the Black Warriors consist of the following fighters :

* Williams - A generic street punk. Not very strong but he wields a variety of weapons such as baseball bats, dynamite and daggers.

* Roper - He is a bit stronger than Williams and likes to pick up and throw large objects such as oil drums, rocks and boxes.

* Linda - Female punk who usually carries a whip. She's not very strong and appears less frequently than the other enemies.

* Bolo - A tall, big-muscled bald guy. He's very strong and likes to pick up and throw the player's character.

* Abobo - The first boss, a head-swap of Bolo with a Mr. T-style mohawk and beard. A green version of Abobo appears in the end of Mission 3.

* Jeff - The second boss. A head swap of the player's character who uses similar techniques. A real challenge.

* Willy - The game's final boss, armed, somewhat unfairly, with a machine-gun.

Behind a clear front glass, the dedicated cabinet has a decorative cardboard frame surrounding the monitor that includes instructions for game play. The cardboard frame is usually 2 sided. There is the TAITO design on one side and the Double Dragon design on the other. The marquee and control panel art features a drawing of a dragon and pictures of Billy and Jimmy Lee. The control panel includes their names. Most cabinets used blue buttons for player 1 and red buttons for player 2, but a middle release cabinet used yellow buttons for both players and used thicker bezel glass with white plastic protectors along its outer edges. The side art features the name TAITO at the top with a Y-shaped pattern of lines in red, white, gray, and black. The first cabinets of Double Dragon had a different color combination for the side art. The black part of the side art was orange and the gray part was yellow. The cabinet features a lockable pullout drawer at the bottom that contains the power supply and game-boards.

Released in August 1987.


Licensed to Taito for manufacture and distribution (Prom Stickers : 21J) in America and Europe (July 1987).


Double Dragon may not have been the world's first scrolling beat-em-up (that accolade belongs to Technos Japan's own "Renegade", released in 1986) but it is the world's first CO-OPERATIVE fighting game and as such defined its era. The varied, multi-colored sprites and hugely detailed backdrops - married to instinctive, one or two-player game-play - was something that had never really been seen in the fighting game before and Double Dragon quickly became a legend in its own right. The game would be the inspiration for an entire genre and classics such as Capcom's "Final Fight" owe a huge debt of gratitude to the Technos legend. The game was such a huge hit, that when the home versions finally came out, the rear side of the package advertised, 'You'll never have to stand in line to play Double Dragon again!'.


Double Dragon's hugely innovative game-play and superb graphics proved to be too ambitious for the host Technos hardware and the game was plagued with the now notorious 'slowdown', that occurred whenever a large number of fighters appeared on-screen.


The game's director, Yoshihisa Kishimoto, reportedly conceived his initial idea for Double Dragon around the date of July 20th in 1986, the 13th anniversary of Bruce Lee's death.


Director Yoshihisa Kishimoto got the idea of picking up an enemy's weapon from his previous game, "Renegade" ("Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun" in Japan). During the first stage of Renegade, he noticed that the armed enemy characters were not holding their weapons when they were on the ground.


On the first stage of the game, a billboard for "Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun" (the Japanese version of "Renegade") can be seen atop a building prior to the first boss battle.


The car at Billy and Jimmy's garage resembles the interceptor from the laserdisc game "Road Blaster", which was one of director Yoshihisa Kishimoto's previous games at Data East before he left the company to work for Technos.


The 3 kanji characters on the game's official logo are (in order) : 'Sou' (Twin) 'Setsu' (Cut or Intercept) and 'Ryuu' (Dragon, also pronounced 'Tatsu'). Thus, the title can loosely be translated as the 'Twin Intercepting Dragons'.


The fictional martial arts practiced by the Lee brothers is called Sousetsuken or 'Twin Interception Fist', which is described as a combination of Shaolin Temple Kung Fu, Karate and Tai Chi Chuan. The name is derived from Bruce Lee's own martial arts style Jeet Kune Do, or Sekkendou in Japan, which is known as the 'Way of the Intercepting Fist'.


The character names are derived from the 1973 Bruce Lee film, 'Enter the Dragon'.


Double Dragon contained a number of bugs, most of which were never fixed despite several revisions of the ROM. The best known is a bug in the way enemies attack the player. Sportingly, enemies will not attack the player from behind, but will instead walk up to them and try to move past so they can attack from the front. Thus, by standing with your back to an enemy, it was possible to wait for them to get close and then elbow them in the face, without fear of being attacked. Another common bug was the 'infinite bouncing' bug. Due to the fixed way in which objects in the game would bounce off walls, trees etc, it was possible to drop an item between two tree stumps on the forest level, and it would bounce back and forth forever. In the first version of the game, this could happen to player characters who fell off either stump, the only way to continue the game being to allow the timer to run down. Another less serious bug was the ability to throw weapons from one level to the next. Usually, weapons were discarded at the end of a level. On some levels however, the transition to the next level was achieved simply by scrolling the screen one whole screen to the right, or down a cliff. By standing at the extreme right of the level and jumping just as it ended, the players character would drop their weapon in mid air, throwing it far enough to be picked up again once the screen had scrolled on.


Jason Wilson holds the official record for this game with 171,210 points on July 24, 1999.


Apollon Music released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Original Sound of Double Dragon - KHY-1026) in cassette format on 21/02/1988. Also released the soundtrack album in CD format (Original Sound of Double Dragon - BY12-5028) on 21/02/1988.

A Double Dragon unit appears in the abysmal 1994 movie 'Double Dragon'.

A Double Dragon unit can be seen in Drake and Josh episode 'Movie Job', but the marquee reads 'Dragon'.


Tiger Electronics released a board-game based on this video game (same name) in 1989 : The winner is the first player to successfully fight his or her way around the game board to Jimmy's Hideout to rescue Marian. You will pass through the slum section, the industrial section, the forest section and the hideout section on the rocky road to victory.


Comic Book : Six-issue limited series published by Marvel Comics in 1991. (cover dated from July to December). Written by Dwayne McDuffie for the first four issues and by Tom Brevoort and Mike Kanterovich for the final two. In this comic, Billy and Jimmy Lee were the twin inheritors of the 'Dragon Force', a mystical force that granted the Lee brothers their powers, as they fought against the occult crime lord Nightfall. Marian is reimagined as a policewoman (a depiction later featured in the cartoon series) and Stan Lee appears as Billy and Jimmy's long-lost father.


Cartoon : TV series produced by DIC Entertainment and Bohbot Entertainment, which lasted two 13-episodes seasons in 1993 and 1994. In the series, Billy and Jimmy are twin brothers who were separated at birth, with Billy being raised by his father's sensei, the Oldest Dragon, while Jimmy was raised by the evil Shadow Master to become his successor, the Shadow Boss. After the second episode, Jimmy realizes the evils of his way and joins his brother, becoming the Double Dragons. Inspired the 1994 home console fighting game "Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls".


Live-Action Movie : Released in 1994 by Imperial Entertainment. Starred Scott Wolf as Billy, Mark Dacascos as Jimmy, Alysa Milano as Marian and Robert Patrick as original villain Koga Shuko. Directed by James Yukich, with a screenplay written by Paul Dini (of Batman: The Animated Series) and Neal Shusterman. In the movie, Billy and Jimmy are young twin brothers who possess one half of a magical medallion, with the other half possessed by crime lord Shuko. It inspired the 1995 Neo-Geo game "Double Dragon".


- UPDATES -


* The original Japanese version by Technos has a different storyline than the one used by Taito in the International version. The Japanese storyline is more developed and does not use the Spike and Hammer aliases.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Here's How To Get Infinite Points In Double Dragon : Level One, one player grabs the whip when it comes out. The other player relieves the enemy who walks out with a bat of that bat. But he does NOT kill that enemy. Continue moving on until you're at the end of stage one. At this point the player WITHOUT the whip grabs the now bat-less enemy. The other player finishes the stage. Note that when the boss man is dead, the clock stops running down. Then the player tortures the bat-less one with the whip. 200 points per pop, and the enemy will NEVER die. Switch to non-whip attack to kill him, and resume normal play.


* To easily get through the whole game, use the following strategy. When an opponent is coming towards you from one direction, face the opposite direction. When the enemy is at arm's length, do an elbow smash. The enemy will go flying forward. While the opponent is still on the ground, face away from him/her and repeat the process. Now, you can defeat enemies without them attacking. This strategy also works for bosses.


* Ghost Player : Notice that player one gets all the points for certain weapons. Notably the barrel, which is important because it is reusable. Should player one die, while player two is still alive, player one continues to get points for the barrel. If this gets him over the extra-man mark, he gets a ghost player, which is limited in the kinds of things he can do.


* Infinite Knives : When an enemy carrying a knife appears on the screen (NOT an enemy that picks up a knife, but one already carrying the knife when he appears), instead of taking the knife beating the enemy, hit the weapon, causing the enemy to drop it (or let it hit a wall). Doing this you will be able to pick up and use the knife against some other enemies, while the character bearing the knife will take out a new one so you can repeat the trick. You can use this same trick with dynamite.


* At the end of some levels you can throw your weapons onto the next stage. Normally you discard them, but you can cheat. This works well on level 1, for instance. When at the end of the level, just after you kill the boss, move to the extreme right of the level, as far as it will scroll. Jump up just as the level ends and scrolls to the next one, if you time it right you will let go of your weapon in mid air and it will fall onto the next stage where you can just about pick it up at the very left of the screen!


* Throw Objects Through the Levels : At the end of the second stage, where the elevator appears, move as far down as possible without falling. Now, when you drop weapons, or hit some enemies, these will fall off-screen instead of falling to the ground. If fallen objects like whips  or knifes fall into a certain area (near the platform), you will find them when descending into level 3.


* Throw Enemies Into the Void : At the beginning of level 3 you will face two enemies; make them come as near to the left of the screen as possible, and throw them off-screen; they will die immediately as if falling into the 'void'.


* At the last level after the walls you will see two guys. Kill the first one and let the second guy on wait. Now you have only one guy in front of the door waiting for you. Just pass him by and when he comes turn fast and give him a punch to turn his head. Now you crash his head. To go back to normal you have to have a second player to catch his back.


* At the very end of the last stage you will notice the machine-gun man looking down on you nodding his head. Normally he will walk down when you have killed a few more hench men. Well if you can entice the BIG guy that throws you over his head towards the wall. Elbow him so he is on the ground facing the wall, at this point stand at his feet and he will throw you on the wall next to the machine gun man. You can then beat the crap out of the machine gun man with his gun on the wall still.


* How to kill the final boss (Willy) in just one hit (also useful to quickly kill the other enemies in the final part of the last level) : This trick requires a lot of dexterity and skill (and a bit of luck too, as it won't work if the enemies won't lean out enough) to be achieved. In the last level, after you kill the 2 Abobo that show up smashing the wall, exploit the edge near the wall on the left to lean out downwards as much as possible (you'd better do it here and now, as later on it will become almost impossible to lean out so much without falling), then move forward and keep fighting while remaining on this edge.

When Willy comes out of the steel door, wait for him to come down to the lower side of the screen; as soon as he leans out downwards enough, hit him and make him fall (be careful in using flying kicks, as you risk to fall on the spikes). If performed with the correct timing, Willy will NOT fall on the ground: he'll fall straight on the spikes, dying at once.

Note : if you use this trick on all the other enemies that show up before Willy, sometimes, after the final boss is thrown in the spikes, an enemy will jump out of the spikes, and fall on them straight afterwards.

- TRIVIA -


Released in February 1995. Double Dragon was Technos' first game for the Neo-Geo hardware. This game was based on the movie 'Double Dragon', which was, in turn, based on the 'Double Dragon series' of games.


The game features a combo counter like many fighting games, however this one is not always very accurate since it registers Cheng Fu's Super Dragon Kick technique (Forward Dragon Punch motion + 2 buttons with the charge meter filled) as a single hit! The original Double Dragon logo can be seen in the large white boat on Cheng Fu's stage!


Billy, Jimmy, Marian and Abobo are the only characters from the original 1987 "Double Dragon" game who were featured in both : the movie and this game. Billy and Jimmy have the ability to transform into more powerful counterparts like they did in the end of the movie, while Abobo turns into his mutated form for a brief moment when he does his 'Grow 'n Throw' super move. Marian is depicted as a female gang leader, much like her movie counterpart. Burnov was the first stage boss in "Double Dragon II - The Revenge", while Duke was the final boss in the Super NES game "Super Double Dragon", although neither character were in the movie. Koga Shuko, the game's final boss, was an original character from the film.


April Simmonds holds the official record for this game with 96,700 points on April 21, 2007.

MVS (arcade) vs. Home (neo-geo) differences :

- Arcade : If you beat the game without losing a round you'll see a drawing of each character posing while the credits roll. If you beat using a continue you just see the credits rolling on the screen in one of the monitors that fell on the last boss.

- Home : Regardless if you use continues or not you will only get the credits that roll on the big monitor screen.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Play As Duke / As King Shuko : Go to the character selection screen and put the cursor on Billy, then Marian, then Chung Fu, then Jimmy for 3 seconds each. If done correctly you will hear the word 'Bingo!'.


* Alternate Costume Colors : Press B, C or D when selecting a fighter.

Double Dragon 3 - The Rosetta Stone (c) 1991 Technos.


A mysterious fortune teller warns Billy & Jimmy Lee about the rise of a powerful enemy in Egypt. Since the Lee brothers are looking for a true challenge to put their martial arts skills to the ultimate test, they agree to face this mysterious new enemy. They embark on a world quest - joining up with new allies in the process - and try to lay claim to the famous 'Rossetta Stone'.


The 3rd and final arcade entry of the Double Dragon series (not counting the later Neo-Geo fighting game based on the movie) features a completely gameplay system and graphics from the first two installments. The game can played by up to 2 or 3 players, depending on the cabinet and settings. The 3rd player takes control of a yellow-clad Lee brother named Sonny, who is exclusive to this game. Techniques from the previous games such as the hair grab and the elbow punch are gone, but new ones are added such as the belly-to-back throw and the back-to-back hurricane kick, as well as the ability to dash by tapping the joystick left or right twice.


The game features weapon shops that allows the player to purchase power-ups by inserting additional tokens. The power-ups differ between stages differ between stages and are available as followed.

* Extra Guys - Allows the player to control a new character who replaces the current fighter when he dies. There are three character types in addition to the Lee brothers.

- The Urquidez Brothers (Roney, Sunny, Jonny) -  Tall European grapplers. They have the most energy of the four character types.  Up to three fighters can be have in reserve.

- The Chin Brothers (Seimei, Taimei, Sinmei) - Chubby Chinese men with powerful attacks.

- The Oyama Brothers (Masao, Kunio, Akira) - Japanese karate masters dressed in gis specializing in speedy attacks.

* Tricks - The hurricane kick and the one-armed stand head butt are added to the player's move set. If the player's current character dies, then the new techniques will be inherited by the next character in reserve, if there is one.

* Weapons - A nunchaku or sword are given player. Only the Lees can have purchase and wield weapons.

* Energy - Restores the current character's life to 150%.

* Power-Up - Increases the character's agility.


There are 5 stages in the game :


Mission 1 - America - The enemies in this stage are typical thugs and bikers. The first area takes place in a downtown area of city. After defeating the first wave of enemies, the player will enter a warehouse, where they encounter bikers that will try to run over them with their bike. The boss in this is Jim, a red-haired biker wearing a leather jacket.


Mission 2 - China - The enemies are martial artists that specialize in flying kicks. The stage takes place in a single level set in a countryside near the Great Wall of China. The boss at the end of level is Li Cheng-Long, a Shaolin Martial Arts expert who resembles Bruce Lee. When he's down in life, he will wield out his club.


Mission 3 - Japan - The enemies are samurai swordsmen. The first area takes place outside a castle, with bamboo traps and enemies coming out of walls. The second area takes place inside a castle, where the player will face a few more swordsmen before taking out on the boss, Ranzou, a ninja. He attacks with throwing stars and smoke bombs and splits into three forms when he's down on his life.


Mission 4 - Italy - Consists of a single level set in the ruins of a coliseum. The enemies are roman archers. After defeating most of the archers, the boss Giuliano, a man decked in gladiator armor, will attempt to run the player over with his horse. After defeating all the archers, Giuliano will dismount at the end of the level and fight the player. He wields a long hand spear and can block attacks with his shield.


Mission 5 - Egypt - The final stage is composed of seven levels, which includes a desert field, an underground forest, a trap room with stone pillars and giant hands emerging from the floor, a hall with a flying disc. Enemies include living tree men and rock creatures.

- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1990.


The first two Double Dragon games were created by an internal team at Technos, but this game was written by an outside team called East Technology (see Staff section for more information). A graffiti in the first stage reads "Gigandes", which one of the team's previous games.


There are 4 character types, the Lee brothers and 3 new character types (who are available via the weapon shops in the American and World versions, and are selectable in the Japanese version). However the original idea for the game was for the player to select between Billy and Jimmy Lee, or one of the 3 new characters introduced in the game. The original characters which were Roney Urquidez (who originally wore orange), Chin Seimei (who originally wore red) and Masao Oyama (who was originally named Masahiko Oyama). Apparently the designers considered the possibility that 2 or 3 players playing the game at the same time might want to control the same character, so they revised this by creating Sonny (the 3rd Lee brother) and 2 siblings for each of the new characters. A separate character portrait was made for Jimmy, which is unused in the released Japanese version. The game's ending depicts the original 5 characters, as does the artwork on the Japanese sales flyer.

Double Dragon 3 / The Conbatribes - Pony Canyon / Scitron - PCCB-00065 - Jun 21, 1991


- UPDATES -


The US version is slightly different, it has the 'Winners Don't Use Drugs' screen.


The Japanese version discards the weapon shops completely from the game. Instead, the game asks the player to select from the 4 character types available when they begin (Lee, Chin, Urquidez or Oyama). The one-armed stand head-butt and the hurricane kick are available as part of the default moveset, but the hurricane kick is made hard to execute. While controlling one of the Lee brothers, a nunchaku or a sword can be found on the floor in certain stages. The first stage is slightly re-arranged, with the starting point moved in front of the Power Records store and the conveyor belt inside the warehouse removed.

Double Dragon II - The Revenge (c) 1988 Technos.


Following his defeat at the end of the original Double Dragon, Willy, the leader of the Black Warriors, retaliates against Billy and Jimmy Lee by murdering their friend, Marian, leaving the brothers with the task to avenge her death.


The sequel to Double Dragon is essentially an upgraded version of the original game, but with with a two-way attacking system similar to one previously used in Technos Japan's 1986 arcade game "Renegade". Many of the attacks and combos from the original "Double Dragon" are retained, as well as new techniques including the invincible Cyclone Kick.


The stages and weapons are redesigned versions of items previously featured in the original game. There are a few new traps such as a bulldozer in the middle of Mission 3 and all of the transition sequences between stages are now done with the character entering the next level via a lift, making it impossible to carry one weapon to the next area.


Most of the enemy characters return from the original Double Dragon, with some given facelifts, but the stage bosses are all new. The enemies are as followed :

* Williams - Has a wilder face and longer hair. He can now run towards the player and do cartwheels. He throws his knives in mid-air and sometimes carry a shovel which he throws towards the player.

* Roper - Has a beard and eye-patch, but otherwise is more or less identical to his original self. He carries shovels and can sometime pick up large objects.

* Linda - She now has a mohawk and face paint. She can also jump off platforms and do the elbow smash against the player. In addition to the ball and chain, she also carries grenades and knives.

* Abobo - Now has a longer hair and a beard, but otherwise is identical to his original self.

* Oharra - A head swap of Abobo with flap-top and a clean face. He fights the same way.

* Jeff - Same as his original self, but now carries grenades.

* Burnov - The boss of Mission 1. An obese wrestler whose face is concealed with a mask. He grabs the player and throws similar punches in the face. After dying, he will stand up and yell, disappearing in front of the player and leaving only his clothes. In later encounters, he will revive himself at least once.

* Abore - The boss of Mission 2. A huge suspender-wearing strongman with Terminator-like sunglasses. His slaps and shoulder tackles do massive damage to the player.

* Chin Taimei - The boss of Mission 3. A Chinese martial artists armed with twin kali sticks. In addition to his energy-drainin stick combo, he also has a jump kick and sweep kick.

* Willy - The boss of Mission 4. Looks like he does in the original game, but now dresses in red. He still uses the same machine gun from the first game.

* The clone - After defeating Willy, the player will have to fight their character's evil self. This clone has all the techniques the player has, but can also throw energy beams and possess the player's body to drain his energy.

The yelling sound heard when a coin is inserted comes from an enemy in the game called 'Chin Taimei' (the mission 3 boss that fights using 2 sticks).


Billy and Jimmy trade their original blue and red outfits for black and white respectively in the game. They appear in the game's ending wearing their original colors. Marian wears a yellow dress in the game and her character sprite is slightly redrawn from the original game.


Unlike the original "Double Dragon", the controller configuration for part two were changed from standard punch and kick buttons to less conventional left attack and right attack buttons.


In the same way the original "Double Dragon" paid tribute to the laserdisc game "Road Blaster", Double Dragon II features a similar homage to the laserdisc version of "Cobra Command" ("Thuder Storm FX" in Japan), which was Yoshihisa Kishimoto's debut game. The helicopter inside the garage at the beginning of the game is the same helicopter from Cobra Command.


Double Dragon II originally began development as a chip upgrade of the first game. However, they was an incentive to add more features to the game, so this plan was discarded. The game's ROM size increased and the game was seriously reworked. However, the increased difficulty and reworked play controls drove away fans of the original game.


Isaiah Johnson holds the official record for this game with 47,880 points on May 31, 2008.


Meldac/Nippon Crown released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Double Dragon II The Revenge - MECG-28001) on 10/03/1990.

Dragon Breed (c) 1989 Irem.


A superb and innovative side-scrolling shoot-em-up from the same gaming stable that gave the world "R-Type", Irem. Dragon Breed differs from other shoot-em-ups through its interpretation of the 'ship' that appears in other games of the genre; in Dragon Breed, the player controls a figure who rides a fully articulated and superbly rendered dragon. What makes this a particularly inspired move is that the Dragon's body - which is invulnerable to enemies and enemy fire - can be used as both a shield and a weapon; the player can move the dragon in such a way that its tail can be used to surround its rider and protect him from his enemies. Any contact the enemy has with the dragon will also deplete the enemy's power and eventually kill it. The dragon can also be 'powered-up' in a similar fashion to the space craft of other shoot-em-ups.


At various point throughout a level, small areas of land will appear at the bottom of the screen. These often contain power-ups and the player can fly the dragon down to the platform, dismount, and move around on foot.


- TECHNICAL -


This game was only sold as a conversion kit, although many distributors would pre-install these kits in generic cabinets, and sell them to the public that way. This is a JAMMA compatible title, so any JAMMA cabinet could be a proper Dragon Breed cabinet. The control panel to this title has a single 8-Way joystick, with fire and jump buttons on either side of it (so you can play either left or right handed). The marquee for this title is a highly detailed scene of a knight riding a green dragon, while being attacked by what appears to be a group of carnivorous fish. Although you may encounter this title in a cocktail cabinet (as the circuit board supports the screen flip for the second player), there were no specific graphics made for a cocktail cabinet (So the game will appear either unmarked, or perhaps with a few of the graphics from the upright kit jury rigged into place).

Dynamite Düx (c) 1988 Sega.


An abstract and hugely entertaining take on the classic sideways scrooling beat-em-up genre for one or two players; in which two blue and red pet ducks called 'Bin' and 'Pin' take on a variety of bizarre enemies - such as disembodied moose heads and mortar-using wolves - in their quest to rescue their kidnapped owner, Lucy.


The ducks have a powerful punch which can be 'charged-up' by holding down the button, in a similar fashion to the beam weapon in Irem's "R-Type". In addition, extra weapons such as rocket launchers and bombs can be picked up along the way.


There are also two bonus stages (which appear after levels 2 and 4). In these stages player one fights against player two. The winner is awarded 100,000 points. If the time limit expires before the fight is settled, the player with the most energy is awarded 50,000 points.

E-SWAT Cyber Police - The Ultimate Factor in the Battle Against Crime (c) 09/1989 Sega.


The player takes on the role of a rookie cop in this sideways scrolling platform shoot-em-up from Sega. A powerful crime syndicate is creating chaos in the cop's home city and he must prove his ability as a police officer by capturing a number of crime bosses, killing as many of their henchmen as possible in the process. The policeman carries a standard issue pistol which only has a limited amount of ammunition. In the event of the ammunition running out, players will only be able to kick their enemies. Extra Ammo can be picked up at various points in the levels.


As the player progresses through the game and makes more and more arrests, their on-screen character will be promoted through the ranks. First to Captain, then Assistant Chief, Chief and finally, once three crime bosses have been arrested, to a full E-SWAT agent. Adorning full, robot-style body armour that bears more than a passing resemblance to the "Robocop" character from the games and movies of the same name. In armoured mode, the cop has vastly increased firepower, including a limited number of bombs that are ejected by a mechanical device on the policeman's back.


As the armoured cop is shot, his armour will gradually disappear until he is finally killed.


E-Swat plays very much like a cross between Sega's own 1987 classic "Shinobi", as well as Namco's superb "Rolling Thunder".

* ESP Ra.de. weapons :

1) Shot : your main shot is fired with the A button, and is the basic fire. If you just tap, the character will move at maximum speed: if you hold down the button, the character will slow down, about 20% slower. When you use the normal shot and have a chain going, destroying enemies while the timer is still active will grant you the multiplied score, i.e. if you have a x15 multiplier active and you destroy enemies, they all will be worth their value x15.You need to take four big "P" power-ups to be fully powered, or 4/8/12/16 (in this order) small "P" power-ups.

2) Secondary Shoot : actually the most important of the two basic weapons: Beside making a lot of damage, it triggers multipliers for your basic points. It works in this way: if you shoot a blast of the secondary shot and hit an enemy, you can land on it from 1 to 15 energy bars (the bar is located at the bottom of the screen, on the player's side of course).  If you destroy the hit enemy with the main shot, you will also trigger a timer for your multiplier: depending on enemy's size, you can get from 0.5 to 2 seconds to continue the chain and keep having the said multiplier on score. Now, the only way to replenish said timer is to collect the bonus cubes.these cubes are released by larger (i.e. that take more hits to explode) enemies and by engulfing bullets into explosions: if this happens, every bullet will be turned into a bonus cube. Now, when you land a secondary attack on an enemy and then destroy it with the main weapon, you will trigger the multiplier bonus: said multiplier is based on the level of energy that lands on the enemy. For instance, if you land a full level 15 secondary attack on an enemy and then destroy it, you will trigger a x16 multiplier : the basic formula is Energy Bar+1=Multiplier Value, or EB+1=MV

The amount of energy in stock depends on your power level : you start at 7/15, then increase by +2 per full power-up. Now, one final note on the bonus cubes: every cube gives you back 0.1 seconds on your multiplier timer. The maximum timer, however, can never be higher than 2 seconds. Bonus cubes are also (obviously) worth points, hence the name: every bonus cube is worth 100 points x the MV, so big showers of cubes are worth a lot of points and will maintain the multiplier going.

3) Psychic bomb : is your limited weapon to get rid of enemies once you don't know what to do.It basically works in this way: you have a big energy bar on the right of the EB, which tells you how much energy you have to use on the bomb. Once you push the C button, you will release a quick blast of energy which will damage hit enemies: unlike the typical smart bomb, it won't clear the screen of all dangers. However, if you hold down the C button, you will create an aura of invicibility, and accumulate more power: this is useful to release more powerful blasts. Once you hold down the button, all bullets going against your barrier turn into bonus cubes, so you can also get back some of them. You can use up to half of the bar for one huge blast (holding down the button will consume your energy).

Now, the bonus cubes we've spoken about are also meant to make you replenish your bomb. How? Once you reach 200 cubes (counter is below the score), the game will be a bit harder and the bonus counter will flash. This also means that you will get more bullets to be cancelled into cubes with explosions, and thus a better change to keep a multiplier going.

Since we've spoken of replenishing the bomb energy, let's see how it works. Once you reach the 200 cubes value, if you don't have a full bomb bar, the bonus cubes will turn into energy bonuses. These will replenish your bomb bar, but the counter will turn quickly back to 0: once it's resetted, you won't get any energy bonuses.Also, next time you will get energy bonuses will be at 300 cubes, then 400, then 500. Finally, if you die, your counter will be reduced at 75% of the stock, then 66%, then 50%, etc...

Eagle (c) 10/1980 Centuri.


An early shoot'em up.


- TECHNICAL -


The sides of the cabinet are decorated with huge stickers of a ship breaking into three parts orbiting a dish-shaped planet. The word 'EAGLE' is written in large letters diagonally across most of the side with round alien ships placed around it. The control panel has an overlay sticker containing docking instructions and labels for the left, right, and one/two player start buttons. Pictures of asteroids and a planet also decorate control panel. The marquee has a different, older-looking tri-stage ship with little planets and alien ships scattered around. The word 'EAGLE' is positioned on the right hand side with what looks like wings on each side. The game was also released as a cabaret. This cabinet has a different overlay than the upright, the title appears on the front bottom of the overlay with the wing design, there is a small spaceship on the right side, and there is no ship on top of the control panel.

* If you locate the red chick, always leave it until last. The 10,000 points outweigh any advantage you may gain by releasing it earlier.


* Run around an egg to avoid the Chomper, and then kick an egg at it when it is on the other side.


* Kick a row of eggs when the Chomper is above you and then move down into the middle and the Chomper will cut across the screen to intercept you, and hopefully run into the row of five eggs you kicked.


* Don't lose your eyes! If you fire your eyes be careful not to hit them with a kicked egg, or you will lose them for the remainder of the screen or until you lose a life.


* Don't collect the hen. Let it run around helping you for as long as possible.


* Force the chomper to cut across screen towards you when there is space and you are behind an egg for an easy kill.

Elevator Action (c) 1983 Taito.


Agent 17 (code name 'Otto') is to secure the top secret documents from the security building. The enemy spies are in pursuit and their orders are to stop him at any cost. Having made it to the top of a 30 story building, Agent 17 has to make his way down to the basement to get to the getaway car and save the documents. Enemy spies are everywhere and the documents are hidden behind the red doors (bonus points awarded). He has to open the door and keep moving. If either of them shoots the lights out there will be a temporary blackout. If Otto finds himself on top of the elevator the player will not be able to control the elevator. If he gets caught in the elevator he is a sitting duck and cannot duck the bullets. By using the escalator he can reach the basement quicker. Otto can defeat his enemy by jump kicking or firing at them. Help Otto to grab all the documents and escape the spies.


- TECHNICAL -


Elevator Action was available in 2 different arcade formats, a cocktail table and an upright dedicated cabinet. Both versions used the same internal hardware though.

* The upright version came in the standard 'Taito Classic' cabinet, which was the same one used for "Jungle Hunt", "Zoo Keeper", "Alpine Ski", and many others. These cabinets normally did not have sideart that advertised the name of the game, instead they had a painted design of lines and shapes, along with a Taito logo. Different titles had different designs and color schemes, although they have been known to ship games in the wrong cabinets. But lets get back on track here. Elevator Action should come in a brown cabinet with a Taito logo up near the top. The marquee shows a scene of Agent 17 waiting for an elevator while an enemy agent shoots at him. While the monitor bezel shows agents on either side, has game instructions at the bottom, and shows an elevator floor display at the top. This bezel artwork is silk screened on glass, and is prone to peeling, be very careful if you have to handle one of these. The control panel has a single 4-Way ball-top joystick mounted centrally, with jump and fire buttons located to either side.

* Internally the machine uses a 19'' open frame monitor mounted horizontally, and a set of game boards that conform to the 'Taito Classic' wiring standard. Many other early Taito games (such as "Jungle Hunt" and "Bubble Bobble") will plug directly into this cabinet without modification.

* The cocktail version came in a table similar in design to the one used for "Space Invaders" and "Carnival". It was not decorated except for a pair of instruction cards underneath the glass. Most Japanese game makers purchased their tables from the same few manufacturers, and were quite likely to change the exact model of cocktail that they shipped in mid production. So assume any Elevator Action cocktail is original unless it is obviously converted from another title.

Getting a secret document : 500 points


The bonus is 1000 points x the level you are on. After 10th level, you will get 10000 points per level completed.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, a quick animation will show a hook with a line connecting to the top of the elevator. Then your character will slide down the line to the roof. Then he will enter the building, in the elevator, at the 30th floor. It is now up to you to get all the secrets and make it to your car. The first thing you must know, obviously, is how to eliminate the enemy agents that are after you. There are a few ways you can do this :

1) Just shoot them. Of course, especially in the later levels, enemy agents make themselves an impossible target by lying down. You can only take them out by riding an elevator down.

2) Jumping on them will take care of them. In addition, you may avoid some of their fire.

3) On the non-dark floors, shoot the light down on top of an enemy agent. You must do this from the elevator. This also has the added effect of causing temporary darkness in the building, making enemy agents harder to see.

4) Crush an enemy agent using the elevator. This is hard to do since they move around. You may get lucky, however, and get one under or on top of the elevator you are on.

5) This way is pretty hard. You might be able to get an enemy agent to follow you and fall down the hole created by the missing elevator.


* You must know how to use the escalators and open the red doors :

1) To use the escalators, just stand on the little rectangle. Then push the joystick UP or DOWN depending on which direction you need the escalator to take you.

2) To open the red doors, stand on the little rectangle. Face the doorknob and press RIGHT on the joystick.


* You have full control over any elevator you enter. This means you can move UP and DOWN on a dime to keep your character safe. This works until the alarm goes off.


* Speaking of elevators, your character cannot duck while in an elevator. Also, while riding the escalators, your character cannot duck, jump, or fire his weapon.


* Also on elevators, you do not have control when you are riding on top of them. This means you are at the mercy of the elevator or the enemy agent controlling it. Be very careful if you ride on top of the elevator. You also cannot go past the bar on the top of the elevator.


* Enemy agents usually come out of the doors on the current floor or the floor above and below. A lot of times it is good to lay a wall of fire down a hallway. This way, you can pick off any enemy agents that happen to come out of one of the doors.


* When you enter through one of the red doors, the enemy agents will lose track of your character but will have a general idea of where your character is. When you exit the room, crouch and lay down fire both left and right to clear off the floor.


* As the levels progress, the enemy agents get better at their tactics. They start to crouch more to mess up your fire. They also may lay down which makes it impossible to hit them unless you are on an elevator and can shoot along the floor.


* As you move up in levels, there will be red doors in odd areas. Areas such as on the lower five floors where only elevators can take you across. Of course, if you get good with the jump button, you can jump those gaps to get to either side quicker. The downside is that enemy agents will usually flood the area and lay down a lot of fire.


* If you happen to get to the B1 floor and you have forgotten to get a red door, the game will automatically put your agent at the door you missed. If it is multiple doors, then you will be placed at the highest floor first.


* There is an internal time limit on how long you can take to get everything out of the building. If you take too much time, an alarm sounds and the following things occur :

a) Although you still have control over the elevators, it is much harder to get them to respond to your commands. If you are in a tight situation that requires a little bit of time, don't wait till the last minute or you may be an ex-agent.

b) The enemy agents move much quicker and their shots move faster. Plus, additional enemy agents will start appearing to really make your life miserable.

c) If your character happens to die, the next man will still be facing the same alarm situation. The only way to resolve the situation is to get all of the secrets and make it out of the building.


* Watch out for the double elevator. If you are in the top car, it will stop two floors short of the bottom since there is a one floor gap, and the bottom car. Try to always get into the bottom car of a double elevator so that you can make a hasty exit and not be trapped with enemy agents firing on you.

The End (c) 1980 Konami.


In 'The End' you control a ship whose mission is to zap as many bug-ships as possible, before you run out of lives, or the bugs manage to spell out the word END with little chunks of brick. You can move left and right, and the bugs attack from the top of the screen, coming out of a large mothership. But the bugs have another mission besides just blindly attacking you. That other mission is to systematically steal the bricks from your three bases, and use them to spell out the word END up near the top of the screen.


- TECHNICAL -


The End was available in both upright and cocktail formats. The upright version came in the standard Stern cabinet, which was the same cabinet that most Stern games came in. The only real difference between different Stern cabinets was that "Berzerk" and "Frenzy" cabinets had an access door in front, and other Stern cabinets did not. The game was black with black t-molding. The sideart consisted of a really awesome looking painted rendition of some sort of blue blasting machine shooting at a pair of bugs. The marquee and monitor bezel are covered with a great scene showing evil looking bugs assaulting a wall, drawn in classic Marvel Comics style. Stern really had some great artists back then, the only manufacturer who was even close to them in this department was Atari. The control panel was aluminum, and had some game instructions and a basic design painted onto most of its surface area. The controls consisted entirely of pushbuttons, with the same layout as the panel on "Space Invaders".


Internally the game used a standard 19inch arcade monitor for display purposes. The game's code ran on the "Scramble" platform. Several other games run on this exact same mainboard, and can be swapped in with an EPROM swap.


There were two different cocktail versions of The End, a small one with a 13inch monitor, and a larger 'Deluxe' one with a 19inch monitor. They were similar in design to the Midway Cocktail ("Pac-Man"/"Galaga"/et cetera), but with control panels that sloped slightly upwards. You probably won't ever see one of these, they didn't even make a lot of them back then, and it is doubtful if more than 1 or 2 have survived to the present day intact.

* In the Konami version, the bases are above you and you can use them as cover, but they block out a lot of your potential shooting area.

* In the Stern version, the bases are below you, which gives you a free path to shoot everything in sight, but also means that you have nowhere to hide.

Enduro Racer [Wheelie model] (c) 1986 Sega.


For their addition to the genre they had come to dominate, Sega delved into the world of off-road motorcycle racing. Enduro Racer features 5 extremely hilly and undulating courses, each littered with logs, rocks, trees and rival racers that must be either jumped over (where the track allows it) or avoided.


Enduro Racer is perhaps best remembered for its 'Wheelie' feature, which required the player to physically lift the cabinet's handlebars to raise the front wheel of the game's on-screen counterpart.

Escape From The Planet of the Robot Monsters (c) 1989 Atari Games.


The evil Reptilons are holding humans hostage on Planet X; one or two players must warp onto the planet and rescue them, destroying the swathes of enemy robot monsters that bar their way. players are armed with laser guns and a fiite number of bombs. Hostages are rescues by simply touching them, but players must be careful not to accidently shoot the hostages. Food can be found in storage lockers and will increase the players' energy levels. Some robots leave gems behind when they are destroyed, and these can be picked-up to give the players a weapon boost.


Robot Monsters is a colourful, comic book-esque and humorous pastiche of the classic sci-fi B-movie genre. The game has a similar feel to Atari's own arcade legend, "Gauntlet", although the scrolling levels of Robot Monsteres are viewed from a 3-D isometric viewpoint.

Licensed to Taito.


This game is known outside Japan as "Mat Mania - The Prowrestling Network".

The 2 players version of this game is known as "Mania Challenge".


In the game, if you look closely at the audience in the background, you will see a variety of recognizable characters including a boy in a Union Jack t-shirt, Darth Vader, Superman, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man (look to the far left when outside the ring) and ZZ Top is very prominently present in the middle of the crowd.


The champion in this game is very obviously a copy of Hulk Hogan. First of all, he bears a striking resemblence to Hogan. Second, his name is "Golden Hulk"; Hulk Hogan debuted wrestling as 'Sterling Golden'. Finally, Golden Hulk's most powerful move is the leg drop, which is Hogan's finisher.


Other wrestlers are copied from superstars of the early 80s : The Insane Warrior is a copy of Road Warrior Animal, Coco Savage is probably Kamala The Cannibal and The Piranha is probably Mil Mascaras. The main wrestler ('You') bears a striking resemblence to Kerry Von Erich. These are guesses, but all the mentioned wrestlers were very popular about the time this game was released.


Rac Carpana holds the official record for this game with 5,000,150 points.


- UPDATES -


In the game, The Piranha's name is misspelled as 'The Pirania'.

Insane Warrior's name is misspelled as 'Insane Worrier'.

Golden Hulk is known as 'Blues Bloody'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


*  If you manage to shoot all the first few screens worth of enemies (which is much easier with two players) you get rewarded with a group of dragonflies moving across the top. Each dragonfly is worth 10,000 points.


* Watch out for WOPs, which are POWs in reverse. They reduce your power level.


* There are special POWs that turn enemies into fruit. They're not the pretty POW on a circular background - those give power-ups - these are just the word POW. If you find one of these, hold off on using it until you get several of the bigger enemies onscreen. They're worth 5,000 points in their fruit form.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint : To get a high score, if you do not miss any shots your bonus score will keep on doubling to 10,000 then reset to 000. When at 10,000 miss a shot then bonus score will revert to 5,000.


* Bug : In the challenge stage, if you shoot all 40 aliens you normally get a bonus charge of 60. Sometimes a red hydra comes out during this stage. If you shoot it and all 40 aliens, you get a total of 41. The game seems to fail the test of 'hits=40' and only gives you a bonus charge of 41.

Express Raider (c) 1986 Data East.


The wild west-themed Express Raider is seperated into 2 different game types; a sideways scrolling fighting sequence and a shooting sequence. The player controls a train robber, or 'Express Raider', and must try to steal the bags of money from the moving locomotives.


During the fighting sequence, the Raider must fight the bank teller, hit the coyotes and then jump onto the train before it speeds away. Once on the train, he must fight his way past other enemies and avoid various projectiles, such as bottles, bullets and shovels full of coal. Players must be careful to duck under the low signs that come along as the train is travelling. Also, once a train carriage is clear of enemies, a bomb will appear between the current carriage and the next; players must quickly jump over to the next carriage before the bomb goes off, otherwise the Raider will fall from the train and a life is lost. If the Express Raider manages to reach the train engine, the loot will be captured and the game will then move on to the shooting sequence.


In the shooting sequence, the Express Raider rides a horse and must shoot at the enemies that appear from the windows of a train carriage. They will shoot back at the player and throw various objects. Players can hit the DUCK button to avoid the enemy attacks. A woman will appear at regular intervals offering the player a bag of money, if the player shoots the woman, a life is lost. After the shooting sequence has been completed, the game will start over again with an increased level of difficulty.

Exterminator (c) 1989 Gottlieb / Premier Technology.


A wholly abstract approach to the shoot-em-up genre in which one or two players take control of a disembodied, digitized human hand and must kill the swarms of insects that have infested a street of houses.


Exterminator is set in a street of houses and players must move from room to room in each property, clearing each one of the infestation, before moving onto the next house. Each player can initially only grap or 'thump' enemies (the latter for ground-based, crawling insects), but a number of power-ups, such as bug spray and somewhat bizzarely, a laser firing finger can be collected to make progress a little easier.

- TRIVIA -


This was the first game to use digitized graphics for every element of the game. It was also the first and only videogame produced by Premier and the last to carry the 'Gottlieb' badge. Production numbers are estimated at only 250 units worldwide; the machines proved to be very unreliable in the field and the abstract gameplay was not a huge hit with players. The dedicated and slightly odd cabinet design made it less appealing to operators, since many other games that were being released during that time were conversion kits. Exterminator remains one of the boldest, if least successful moves to bring something genuinly original to an increasingly staid arcade industry.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* On the first level inside the kitchens of houses one and 3, the freezer door swings open only once, releasing some floor-based enemies. If you get the hand in laser mode and shoot while the door is open, you will warp to the other house.

When driving the turbo car, activate the turbo boost by holding both buttons while at top speed.


There are 2 ways to decelerate, either by releasing button 1 while at top speed (or in turbo mode) or by releasing both buttons simultaneously.


When in the pit, tap the buttons to make the repairs go faster.

Fantasy Zone (c) 1986 Sega.


The Fantasy Zone is under attack by an army of ruthless, yet undeniably cute, alien enemies. A fearless space fighter by the name of 'Opa-opa' (a craft that is as cute as the game's enemies, featuring wings and feet - the latter appearing whenever the player flies down to ground level at the bottom of the screen) must stop the alien invasion to restore peace to the Fantasy Zone, as well as finding his missing father, 'Opapa', in the process.


Each level has a number of large, enemy generating ships, that produce a constant stream of enemies to attack the player. While the enemies the generators produce can either be shot or avoided, the generators themselves MUST be destroyed. Once the generators are gone, an end-of-level ship will appear that must be beaten to complete the level.


Fantasy Zone is rendered with the surreal, brightly coloured graphics that typify many Japanese videogames; with an equally abstract approach to in-game weapons: with that cartoon comedy staple, the 'anvil', making an appearance.

Take off on a fantastic video trip. A voyage that simulates the thrills and skills of actual Hang Gliding. Players use the joystick to control Freddie, but good timing and strategy is necessary to successfully negotiate invisible air currents, wind direction and up and down drafts. This game has incredible visual impact for this time, Freddie flies the skies over the Alps--over trains, trees, bridges, through winter and summer seasons; over the Pacific--over a yacht, tropical islands, an aircraft carrier; and over Egypt--camels, Pyramids, the Taj Mahal, the Sphinx, through day and night landscapes. It's a complete global challenge with non-stop action over a continuously changing panorama below.

- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1991.


This game is known in Japan as "Garou Densetsu - Shukumei no Tatakai" (translates from Japanese as 'Legend of Hungry Wolf - Battle of Destiny').


Originally called 'Real Bout', SNK opted to change the title to 'Fatal Fury'. You can see the game's original title on the banner of a store in the background of Hwa Jai's stage ('Real Bout Shop').


Acording to the USA flyer, the name of the game is 'Fatal Fury - The Battle of Fury'. On the ingame titlescreen, however, it's called 'Fatal Fury - King of Fighters'.


The official name of the tournament is 'The King of Fighters'. This can be verified if you look closely the promo poster seen in the name rankings. Later SNK would use this name for a popular game series of its own.


The music in a 2-player battle is taken from the first stage of "Street Smart".


This is the very first game that featured one of SNK's most famous fighters : Terry Bogard! Over the years, Terry Bogard has appeared in many games, usually in his familiar jacket with a star on his back and a cap on his head. However, what is on his cap is different (probably because he tosses so many of them, but that's a different story). Some games have him wear a blank cap, some have his cap say 'Running Wild', some have the Neo-Geo logo on them, but the commonly accepted cap is the one that says 'Fatal Fury' on it.


Terry Bogars appears in "Quiz King of Fighters" as selectable character.


This game was such a hit in Japan that an animated movie was released featuring character designs by Masami Ohbari. This movie's plot is fairly true to the game's main plot and all the characters in the game are featured. The movie was released on the USA by coutesy of Viz Video, a division of Viz Comics.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Garou Densetsu, Last Resort - PCCB-00087) on 21/05/1992.


- UPDATES -


The Japanese version features quite different move list sets for the three main characters (In the Fatal Fury sequels as well as the King of Fighters, Terry, Andy & Joe's move list sets are clearly based on the Japanese release of this particular game). All other versions feature very simplified joystick commands for each move.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


As the game sometimes says on the continuation screen, you can tell some opponents' weak points by watching their moves carefully, which can help you figure out how to beat them. Here are a few examples :


-- If you've knocked down an opponent, you can damage them some more by charging at them with a 'dash attack' just as they're getting up, until they've been fully beaten. This may work best when playing with Andy Bogard.


-- When Tung Fu Rue changes into a hefty beast Incredible Hulk-style, he'll be briefly intangible as he beats his chest. Wait until the right moment and then dash at him (or, if you're playing with Joe Higashi, you can use his rapid punch). He won't actually fall on the ground in this form, but he'll be easier to beat until he turns back to normal as long as you can keep dash-attacking him.


-- When you're facing Hwa Jai, he'll be thrown a bottle of some kind of drink by an agent of Geese standing within the crowd of spectators, and after drinking it (during which time he'll be briefly intangible too), that's when he really lets loose with damaging attacks. If you feel Hwa Jai's too hard to deal with this way, you can try to cause him damage by a small amount, and if your lifebar is still higher than his, you can then step back on defense. He'll try hitting you with standard punches and kicks, but will not throw you, and this way, you can keep on the defensive until the timer runs out, winning simply by having more life energy left than he does.


-- When facing Billy Kane, if his pole falls away (he can either throw it at you or it can fall when he's thrown to the ground), he'll go on the defensive until another agent of Geese's tosses him another pole from within the crowd on the bridge. When he jumps up to grab hold of it, that's when you can move in and try to grab and throw him to the ground, or ram him with a dash attack.


Finally, when facing Geese Howard in the showdown match, you can move towards him as the round begins and then grab and throw him to the ground, then, by timing your attacks correctly, you can grab him in a body slam again when he gets up, eventually beating him by body-slamming him repeatedly. It's a tricky strategy, but it can work!

- TRIVIA -


Released in December 1992.


This game is known in Japan as "Garou Densetsu 2 - Arata-Naru Tatakai" (translates from Japanese as 'Legend of Hungry Wolf 2 - The New Battle').


Acording to the USA flyer, the name of the game is 'Fatal Fury 2 - The Sultan of Slugs Battle Royale'. On the ingame titlescreen, however, it's just called 'Fatal Fury 2'.


Things that changed in this sequel :

* This game allows you to switch between the background & foreground planes at will (in the first game, you could only switch planes if the CPU was on a different battle plane!).

* The game ditches the previous game's 3 button setup (punch, kick & throw) in favor of a new 4 button setup (light & heavy punches & kicks). This is apparently one of the very first Neo-Geo fighters to use this now common button setup.

* This game introduces the use of Desperation Moves (highly damaging techniques that can only be used when the life-bar is flashing red). This game as well as "Art of Fighting" were the first fighting games to introduce these moves.

* Newcomers in the game are : Mai Shiranui, Cheng Sinzan, Kim Kaphwan, Jubei Yamada, Big Bear (aka Raiden), Axel Hawk, Lawrence Blood & Wolfgang Krauser. Richard Meyer, Michael Max, Tung Fu Rue, Duck King, Hwa Jai & Geese Howard were left out! (although some of them make some cameos during some of the game's cut-scenes!).


Just as the first game introduced the famed Terry Bogard, this game features SNK's most popular fighter lady : Mai Shiranui! :). Mai appears in "Quiz King of Fighters" as selectable character.


The Hungry Wolf is a reference to Terry Bogard, the main character in Fatal Fury. Terry, Andy and Joe (and to a lesser extent, Mai and Mary) are referred to as the Lone Wolves.


Keeping the tradition of the first game, an animated movie based on this game was released in Japan featuring character designs by Masami Ohbari. The movie was also released in the USA by Viz Video, a division of Viz Comics. After the second Fatal Fury movie was released, a third movie followed (which predated "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory"). It follows the adventures of the Lonely Wolves (Terry, Andy, Joe and Mai) as they attempt to prevent a power-hungry man from claiming all the parts of the legendary Armor of Mars.


When a player wins a match in a single player game, the post match screen shows people watching the tournament inside the Pao Pao Cafe from the first game, "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters".


Pony Canyon released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Garou Densetsu 2 - PCCB-00111) on 19/02/1993.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* You can only see any character's ending if you beat the game with a single credit used (no continues or 2-Player matches are allowed)


* Just like the first game, it's possible to use the strategy of dashing at your opponents just as they're getting up in order to damage them repeatedly.


* Billy Kane, Axel Hawk and Lawrence Blood all have stages that use a single plane, with the 'second' plane having objects on it that can injure players if they're knocked against them (all three of these bosses have ways of throwing their opponents into the background). You can knock the bosses into the background too by standing close to them while they're dazed and then hitting them with a good hard kick or punch.

Released in March 1995.


This game is known in Japan as "Garou Densetsu 3 - Haruka-Naru Tatakai" (translates from Japanese as 'Legend of Hungry Wolf 3 - The Distant Battle').


Things that changed in this particular game :

* The game introduces a deeper plane change system which proved to be somewhat clunky & difficult to use due to the tricky commands used to move between planes.

* Chain combos are introduced to add even more depth to each character's fighting style. 

* Throws are harder to use since these are slow and throw-miss animations were added.

* Newcomers in the game are Bob Wilson, Blue Mary, Franco Bash, Hon Fu, Sokaku Mochizuki, Ryuji Yamazaki, Jin Chonshu & Jin Chonrei.


Hon Fu's goofy martial artist routine & easygoing personality make him SNK's hillarious homage to Jackie Chan. Definitely not a Bruce Lee clone! :)


Kyo Kusanagi & Sie Kensou make a cameo in Pao Pao Cafe!


The Japanese version of this game, Garou Densetsu 3, overtly refers to itself by its overseas name of "Fatal Fury 3" throughout the game.


Pony Canyon released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Garou Densetsu 3 - PCCB-00179) on 21/04/1995.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


One of the coolest things of this game is the fact that you can alter some backgrounds objects by slamming opponents against them. For example, you can knock away the training dummy in Joe's stage if you send an opponent flying towards it. Experiment on various stages to find more surprises!


Endings are based on your performance on the game, here are the final bosses you'll face according to how well you do :

1) Poor performance ending boss : Ryuji Yamazaki

2) Average performance ending boss : Jin Chonshu

3) Above average performance ending boss : Jin Chonshu (Jin Chonrei makes a brief cameo at the very end)

4) Good performance ending boss : Jin Chonrei


Note : If the game is set on the USA, ASIA or EUROPE bios, the game will reset after defeating Jin Chonrei and you won't get to see the ending, however if the game is set on the JAPAN bios it will work just fine! :)

- UPDATES -


MVS (arcade) vs. Home (neo-geo) differences :

- Home : After the credits you will see all the characters grouped together and it will say to try a harder difficulty. If you beat it in the hardest difficulty it will say 'Perfect! It's a knockout, Superman!'.

- Home : If playing on the hardest difficulty and you fought Ryo Sakazaki, you will see all the characters moving around him in a circle while he, for some reason, is crying.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Fight against Ryo Sakazaki : Beat the game without losing a single round (you can lose continues, but not rounds). You'll face against "Art of Fighting"'s main character Ryo Sakazaki as a powerful extra end boss!


* Beat the game without using a single continue and after the credits you will see every character performing a special move, their portraits and giving a quote.

Fax (c) 1983 Exidy.

Players : 2

Buttons : 4 (A, B, C, and D)


- TRIVIA -


Released in June 1983.


Fax came in what was essentially a jukebox cabinet (with a black and woodgrain finish). This was probably because Exidy had hoped to sell this machine to a different market than its normal arcade games. It has a 9in. monitor mounted in the center (with a 'Fax' logo on the monitor bezel), and a row of buttons on each side of the screen. Sales of this title were limited a bit by its $2495 price tag (USD), which was a good $500 over the average arcade game price at the time.


This game used an advanced (proprietary), compression algorithm to hold nearly 3700 questions in a tiny amount of EPROM space (roughly 128K, which was still a huge amount of storage in 1983, which was why this game was so expensive). Exidy also sold several EPROM replacement kits that provided new questions, but they sold very poorly, and are nearly impossible to find today.

Final Fight (c) 1989 Capcom.


Jessica, the daughter of the city Mayor Mike Haggar has been kidnapped by the evil 'Mad Gear' gang. Set in the fictional Metro City, Haggar rounds up two of his closest friends, Guy and Cody, and sets out to battle Mad Gear's gang members and ultimately rescue his daughter.


1 or 2 players choose to play as either Guy, Cody or Haggar in this superb, sideways scrolling beat-em-up. As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, but with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's energy is lost. Energy levels can be replenished by finding the food that lies hidden in certain crates and barrels. Some of the Mad Gear gang members will drop a weapon when they are felled. These weapons can then be picked up and used by the players.


After the benchmark-setting "Double Dragon", released by Technos in 1987, Final Fight would become the standard-bearer of the scrolling beat-em-up genre. Featuring a large variety of distinctive, well animated characters moving through colorful and detailed backgrounds, and with a control system that is as intuitive as it is complex, Final Fight is still considered to be the finest example of its kind.

- TRIVIA -


Released in December 1989.


This game was originally billed as the sequel to "Street Fighter" and was to be called "Street Fighter '89". While the game had become a major hit in its own right, Capcom decided to change the name to "Final Fight" and save the "Street Fighter" name for another game, 2 years later.


Guy's name is written with the kanji meaning 'victory song'. The character of Guy has been allegedly inspired by the lead singer of the post hardcore group Fugazi, Guy Picciotto.


The enemy character, Andore, and all of his relatives (Andore Jr., Uncle Andore, Father Andore and Grandfather Andore) are Capcom's homage to the now late WWF Champion, Andre Rene Roussimoff, aka 'Andre the Giant'.


2 other Mad Gear characters, Axl and Slash, are parodies of the lead singer and guitarist respectively from American rock band, 'Guns 'N' Roses'.


Poison is taken from the glam rock group of eighties, in which the singer used to wear a similar hat to the female character in the game. The character Poison is actually a male transvestite and so is Roxy (although a translation error in the Capcom Classics Collection character profiles refers to Roxy as a female).


Abigail is a King Diamond album, whose singer (King Diamond) resembles the character in the game.


Sodom is a famous German thrash metal band founded in the eighties.


The enemy character 'Two P' appears in "Forgotten Worlds" as the second player ('Two P' for 2P, 'Player 2').


The game shares a similar plot with the 1984 movie 'Streets of Fire' directed by Walter Hill. Starring : Michael Parï¿½, Diane Lane, Rick Moranis and Willem Dafoe. Here's a list of the things the movie and the game have in common (Warning! Contains movie spoilers) :

1) The main character played by Michael Parï¿½ is named 'Tom Cody' and resembles the game character. Wears jeans and a white shirt at some points during the movie.

2) The city is plagued by gangs and a motorcycle gang kidnaps Codyï¿½s Ex girlfriend. 

3) The cop that arranges a meeting between Cody and the Gangï¿½s boss is nothing other than a corrupted cop by the name of 'Ed Price', the only Cop in the game is called 'Eddie'.

4) The city has an old and trashed look similar to the game.

5) At the end of the movie Cody leaves the girl just like in the game. Only this time there is no 'Guy' to stop him from leaving (see Final Fight ending sequence)


A bootleg of this game is known as "Final Crash".


Before the release of "Final Fight", Capcom released a vertically scrolling driving/shoot-em-up called "Mad Gear".


Pony Canyon/Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Final Fight : G.S.M. Capcom 3 - PCCB-00030) on 21/05/1990.


- UPDATES -


The Japanese version has an additional scene that shows Jessica in underwear on the TV. This scene was removed in all non-Japanese versions of Final Fight.


The US version has the 'Winners Don't Use Drugs' screen.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* At the front of the train of level 2, stand on the barrel and let the clock get to about 45. You will skip the section without defeating the Mad Gear guys.


* Special Endings : finish the game without having to continue to see an additional credit sequence (meet the staff).


* Hidden Stuff  :

Gaining extra points : to gain jewels and other high points items from breakable stuff like barrels, dustbins. Execute the jump+down attack move. (Cody - headbutt, Guy - Elbow). When doing the move, rapidly jag controller left to right. Usually, jewels will appear instead of other cheap things.

Crewing Gum : when fighting Eddie B. (Cop), you will notice that he spit out a wad of gum. That thing will give you about half a life if you pick it up.

Last Boss : Cody is able to punch away the bolts that the last boss fires. No other character can do it.

Off the wall attack : besides doing the normal off the wall flying kick, you can change it into a flying elbow drop by doing down+attack.

Hidden Gems : on the way to the last boss, there is a stage when there are some pillars. Located at the bottom of each pillar are gems. Make sure you get them. 


* Super Combo : This super combo can be easily executed with Cody or Guy, but it's a bit tougher with Haggar. To begin, initiate a punching combo (press attack, attack, attack for Cody or Guy) or (attack, attack for Haggar.) While you're pressing these buttons, hold the d-pad AWAY from your enemy. Before you do your final ending combo blow, you will throw the enemy, delivering massive damage!

Note : You can also start this combo with a jumping knee (jump and hold down, press attack) to deal even more damage! (This will not work for Haggar).


* Cody is the only character who can attack with a knife without throwing it. Press Attack while standing next to an enemy to stab them.

The primary objective of the game is to find and destroy the enemy's submarine, while avoiding the enemy's torpedoes. Through your virtual periscope you are free to launch one of your 8 torpedoes to take out any of the enemy's various ships for extra points. It takes some time to reload each torpedo tube, so you must be judicious in how you plan your attacks.


In addition to being able to control the left/right rotation of your periscope, the game also features a submerge button which you can use to temporarily hide from the enemy. Holding this button down keeps you hidden but also keeps you out of the action, allowing the enemy free reign over the seas.


- TECHNICAL -


The cabinet was split into two halves, with each player controlling their first-person submarine perspective on their half of the screen.

Fire Trap (c) 10/1986 Data East.


An abstract arcade game in which a single player tales on the role of a firefighter, who must climb a burning building rescuing the people and animals who are trapped inside. As well as the fires, the firefighter must also avoid or deflect (the latter with his extinguisher) a number of falling objects and debris, including cars, couches, hammers, chairs, lamps, stoves and refridgerators.


Fire Trap is very similar, gameplay-wise, to Nichibutsu's 1980 classic, ''Crazy Climber''. As the firefighter climbs the building, he must use his fire extinguisher to put out the fires which include burning papers, flame-gushing windows and moving fireballs. The fire extinguisher contains only a limited amount of water, so must be used it wisely. Certain extinguished fires, however, reveal cannistors of extinguisher fuel to be colleced. Other extinguished fires reveal bonuses and, very occasionally, springboards; which shoot the player higher up the skyscraper.


The firefighter's ultimate aim is to reach the roof of the skyscraper and rescue a young woman who is trapped there. As the firefighter reaches the roof, a giant fireball appears and circles the tower; this must be either avoided or extinguished. After the firefighter has rescued the woman, he must fly down the building with his jet pack and extinguish any fires remaining on the building; before finally landing safely on the ground. The firefighter will then move on to another burning building to make another rescue attempt.

Fire Truck (c) 06/1978 Atari.


Fire Truck is a simple two-dimensional driving game. Your perspective is from overhead as you navigate through the city streets. The object is to score points by getting as much distance as possible in the least amount of time. Those who are good enough can get bonus time for a specific amount of points. Beware, though, it will not be as easy as it seems.

Control : Steering wheel (for both players front and rear), Gas pedal (at the bottom of the cabinet)

Buttons : 2 (HORN (front player), BELL (rear player))


- TRIVIA -


This game is also known as "Smokey Joe".


Fire Truck was one of the first games to feature a cooperative feature. One player could either drive the fire engine or the hook and ladder while the computer drove the opposite part. Two players could play where one drove the fire engine while sitting up front while the other player stood in back and controlled the hook and ladder. This game also featured the front player having a horn while the back player had a bell. Neither of these buttons, though, effected game play. This game never really gained a large popular following mostly due to the fact that "Space Invaders" was released the same year. Nonetheless, it still proved to be somewhat popular just due to the fact it was different.


- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is really simple. Your score is tied to distance traveled so obviously you want to cover the most amount of distance in the shortest period of time. Your score goes up in 10 point increments.  Depending on what the fuel setting on the machine is set to determines what your score needs to

be for extended time. Below are these settings :

FUEL SETTING || REQUIRED SCORE |

Fuel Setting : 60 - Required Score : 120

Fuel Setting : 90 - Required Score : 160

Fuel Setting : 120 - Required Score : 220

Fuel Setting : 150 - Required Score : 270


An extended time of 39 fuel is awarded when you are equal to or greater then the required score.


After you get done playing the game, you will get a rating based on your final score. Below are the ratings :

Score Range : 0-50 - Rating : SORRY

Score Range : 60-100 - Rating : SO-SO

Score Range : 110-140 - Rating : GOOG

Score Range : 150-Over - Rating : ACE


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your fire truck will be in the middle of the road. It will be your job to navigate the truck through the city streets and avoid all the hazards. Try to stay in the middle of the road as much as possible. Especially around curves since it is very easy to run into hazards on the road.


* Learn how to use the steering effectively. The steering is relatively sensitive so don't spin the wheel or you will quickly find out that your fire truck either isn't going anywhere, or it is hitting hazards which drastically effects distance traveled. Small movements on the steering wheel (front or back) should be enough to keep the fire truck from going out of control.


* In addition to steering, learn how to use the gas pedal effectively to slow down around corners. This is easier then speeding through them and running into hazards which consumes a lot more fuel then just going slowly. If you are driving the hook and ladder, just make sure you keep the hook and ladder in line with the fire truck.


*  Don't panic if you do hit a hazard. Just patiently turn the fire truck or hook and ladder so you clear the hazard and can continue on your way.


* Make sure you follow the directional arrows on the road or you may end up going backwards down the road and head for unpleasant surprises.


* Your goal is to get the points necessary to get bonus time. After playing this game for a while, you will notice that the roads tend to repeat themselves making it easier to anticipate when the next curve or hazard is coming up.

Fitter [Upright model] (c) 1981 Taito.


The object of the game is for the player to maneuver his white robot in 1 of 4 directions within a maze, capture a red character robot as they move about the maze, and race to the center to change the 9 white balls located there to red. The player may only change one white ball to red at a time after he has captured a red robot, and must evade 4 chaser monsters in the process. Bonus point may be earned when capturing the elusive 'red king' that appears on the screen. Capture him and momentarily immobilize the chasers, but do not come in contact with the yellow robots--or your much-needed red robots will be changed to white and force you to change strategy. Play is over when the chasers have captured all of the player's robots. But, should the player be successful in changing all of the balls in the center to red, the pattern clears and a different challenge is presented. A 3x3 or 4x4 tri-colored pattern will appear at the bottom of the screen and a slightly different tri-colored cube of corresponding size will appear at the center of the screen. The player may earn bonus points by moving the directional arrow and rearranging the colors of the cube at the center of the screen to match the sample pattern presented at the bottom of the screen. The player is given 90 seconds to rearrange the cube as many times as he can. Action returns to the maze whether you win or lose the cube challenge. All in all, an exciting and challenging game where patience and skill are required.

Food Fight (c) 1982 Atari.


The player, as Charley Chuck, must dodge all kinds of flying fruit and vegetables and try to eat an ice cream cone before it melts. How many ice cream cones can he eat? Your players will soon find out in this incredible video feast. As an ice cream cone melts on the other side of the screen, Charley Chuck just naturally has to go for it, But he must get past Oscar, Angelo, Jacques and Zorba, four chefs who unexpectedly pop out of holes, chase Charley Chuck and throw food at him. They all have different personalities and they're all out to stop Charley Chuck if he isn't fast enough. There are piles of tomatoes, peas, bananas, pies and watermelon Charley Chuck can use to defend himself from the persistent chefs. The player controls Charley Chuck with an analog joystick which allows 360 degree movement on the playfield, and a Throw button, used when Charley Chuck needs to throw food at one of the chefs.

- TRIVIA -


Food Fight was designed for Atari by General Computing as part of a lawsuit settlement for an illegal speedup kit for "Missile Command", in which they affixed their copyright. This was one of two games; "Quantum" was the other. Inspired by the food fight scene in National Lampoon's Animal House.


This game has 125 recognized levels. On level 125 on the selection screen, it gives you the requisite free man with a ? above his head. While there are levels after 125, the game counter will not go that high.  It should be noted that the gameplay on this high a level is very reflex/twitch oriented. Only those with ice coursing through their veins can decipher the action on the screen.


The game code shares a hidden message : HI JON.


Approximately 2,050 units were produced (only ~100 cocktail).


Ken Okumura holds the official record for this game on 'regular' settings with 103,103,100 points.

Jon Dworkin holds the official record for this game on 'Tournament' settings with 1,234,100 points on June 3, 2001.


A Food Fight unit appears in the 1985 movie 'Real Genius'.


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".


- SCORING -


Hit chefs with food : 100 to 1,000 points.

Chef falls into hole : 200 points.

Eat the ice cream cone (levels 1-49) : Level x 500 points .

Eat the ice cream cone (levels 50 and above) : 25,000 points.

Unused food at end of level : 100 points each.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Free men are awarded at 25,000 and at 100,000 thereafter.


The best way to get the ice cream in the later levels (level 85 or above) is to use the diagonal method. If you are placed close to a corner, run diagonally toward the lower wall and then diagonally upward toward the cone. Hopefully there will be some food placed between you and the chefs. 


In later levels, it is NOT advised to try and target the chefs coming toward you. The only chef you need to concentrate on is the one running toward the ice cream in front of you.

Forgotten Worlds (c) 1988 Capcom.


Two jet-pack wearing marines must battle a powerful enemy force that has seized and inhabited their home planet - now known as 'Dust World' - and restore the planet to its former name of 'Earth'. Forgotten Worlds is the third and final game in Capcom's 'Jet-Pack Hero' trilogy (with the first two games being 1985's "Section Z" and 1986's "Side Arms - Hyper Dyne") and, as with the first two games, is a one or two player sideways scrolling shoot-em-up.


Forgotten Worlds' gameplay features multi-directional shooting, with the Marines being able to rotate through 360 degrees, allowing players to fire in any direction. When killed, enemies drop 'Zenny Coins' which can be used to upgrade weapons and player health at the shops that appear at the halfway point of each level. Forgotten Worlds features superb graphics and ingenious enemy design, and was converted to many different home formats.

Forgotten Worlds is the 3rd and final game of Capcom's 'Jet-Pack Hero' series; the other games being "Section Z" and "Side Arms - Hyper Dyne".


While Forgotten Worlds isn't a sequel to "Black Tiger", ot does share similarities with it: In both games the player fights dragons, and also collects 'ZENNY' coins, money to buy weapons and armour in shops. Also, both games feature intros depicting dragons attacking cities.


The first player character, Unknown Soldier, appears as an assist character in "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes". The second player character appears in "Final Fight" as an enemy member of the Mad Gear gang; he was then called 'Two P' (for 2P, 'player 2').


The shop music used in this game was later remade and used as the shop music for "SNK vs. Capcom - Card Fighters Clash".

Nichibutsu never released the old version in the U.S. for unknown reasons, although one could guess one of them. Perhaps it was the naked woman in the bath tub in which as you advanced in the game, bubbles would be washed away revealing her breasts?? Probably didn't go over too well with the U.S. arcade owners in the early 80's.


When the game was released, in October 1981, the service manual that came with the  original cabinet described the old version (set 2) of game play. That didn't help arcade owners much because it didn't match the system  they received. The game wasn't very popular so there were few complaints.


The flyer reads 'Nichibutsu original custom C.P.U. was used for the first time in video games'.


Cast of Characters :

FRISKY TOM

BOMB - When the bomb explodes, the *game is over.

MOLAR Mouse (Orange) - **50 points awarded if bumped by Tom.

MEGATON Mouse (Violet) - Mouse who plants the bomb.

KLEPTO Mouse (Green) - *****Mouse who takes or carry aways pieces of pipe.


(* The game is not actually over. You just lose a life)

(** Molar Mouse is worth 200 points in the new version. The value keeps doubling up to a maximum of 128,000 points for each consecutive mouse bumped before the first mouse hits the ground)

(*** In the new version MEAN Mouse is red)

(**** In the new version MEAN Mouse will kill Tom if he touches or falls on it. MEAN mouse doesn't fall in the old version)

(***** KLEPTO Mouse is not in the new version)


- UPDATES -


Two Different Frisky Tom Games ?


The new version (set 1) differs from the old version (set 2) and has a tremendous impact on game play and strategy. In addition to the differences listed in the Cast of Characters, the following are also noted :

* Frisky Toms are tracked as 'lives' in the new version while in the old version they are water tanks.

* In the new version, the bottom tank starts with 4000 points and will gradually slip to 0 if no water gets to it. A life is lost at this point (Frisky Tom). In the old version, water must be filled to maximum to not lose a life (a tank). A song will be played when the bottom tank is filled completely.

* The bomb fuse can be put out by either dropping on it from the left or all the way to the end of the screen on the right (reappear on the left side) in the new version. In the old version you can only put out the fuse on the left side. You fall just short if you move off to the right side of the screen.

* MOLAR mouse can be knocked down in any position on the pipes in the new version. MOLAR mouse can only be knocked off in the old version when he is transiting up and down on a pipe.

* The new version has classes of difficulty 'A', 'B' & 'C'. In the old version there are no difficulty classes.

* In the new version the lady will appear between levels everytime the bottom tank has more than 1900 points. Also she wears a bikini. In the old version the lady will appear every 3 levels or so and she is naked!

* Game config is backed up by 4.5v battery in old version.

* Old version uses larger board.

Frogger (c) 1981 Konami.


Frogger is a 1- or 2-player game in which players move their frog from the bottom to the top of the screen. This is achieved by overcoming a number of hazards without getting run over or drowned.


The first half of the screen is bi-directional flow of traffic including buses, cars and race cars. Players must avoid these vehicles. Frogs can move safely with the flow of traffic to make their way to the second half of the screen, which consists of a river with fast moving logs and sinkable turtles. Frogs must hop on the backs of the logs and the sinkable turtles to get to the home base at the top of the screen. At random times throughout the game play, a lady frog will appear on a log. Bonus points are scored if the frog successfully hops on the back of the lady frog and escorts her safely home. A fly will also appear randomly in a home base. Bonus points can be scored if the frog hops in the home base when the fly is present. Sinking turtles also swiftly move across the river with the logs. If a frog is unsuccessful in hopping on a turtle's back, the frog will sink and drown. Crocodiles, snakes, and otters also roam the moving river waiting to eat frogs on their way up to the home base. Players can hop on their back (except the snake, whose touch is deadly), but they must avoid their open mouths. The frog must be lined up perfectly to enter one of the 5 home bases. Players must maneuver the frogs to their home base within the allotted time (60 beats on the timer).


The frog can move vertically or horizontally by maneuvering the joystick.  Players must maneuver the frog swiftly and precisely without getting run over, drowned, or eaten by the creatures that roam the flowing river. Avoiding traffic, deadly snakes, otters, crocodiles, and the treacherous diving turtles make game action stimulating in Frogger.


- TECHNICAL -


Frogger came in a rather plain looking Sega cabinet known as the 'Convert-a-Cab'. The cabinets had wood grain sides, and the monitor was laid back at a 45 degree angle (just like the monitor in a "Ms. Pac-Man"). The control panel, monitor bezel, and marquee all have a single tire tread graphic that continues on all of them. Most machines have a large sticker for sideart. This game uses the Konami Classic wiring harness, but it doesn't have any buttons, which limits plug and play conversion quite a bit.

- TRIVIA -


1981 was a big year in video games. A lot of companies were putting some pretty popular games on the market and it created a very competitive atmosphere as to what company was putting out the most popular ones. In addition, 1981 continued on the trend of the 'cute' type games such as "Ms. Pac-Man", "Qix", and a host of Pac-Man clones. Konami was already becoming a force to be reckoned with in the video gaming world. With such hits as "Space War", "Scramble", and "Super Cobra", Konami was making its mark. Frogger was originally released in Japan (June 1981) and it became a runaway hit. Sega were awarded the license to manufacture the game in the United States (October 1981) and it was the first major hit for this company (in 1982, "Zaxxon" became their number one game).


The sound that can be heard when a coin is inserted into the machine was sampled by producer Richard X for the Sugababes' song, 'Freak Like Me' (and is the very first sound on the track).


Frogger has numurous bugs, although many of these are not immediately apparent to the average player :

1. Sections of the music will occasionally cut out, although the main melody will continue to play.

2. On occasion, Frogger displays a somewhat haphazard approach to collision detection. One side effect of this is that the player can sometimes make a perfectly legal and safe jump and still lose a life. Another side effect of this is that the player can jump up onto the first row of turtles, and then immediately jump back. This will place the player 'off the grid', and it is now possible to jump right off the side of the screen, leading to a loss of life.

3. There are several other odd jumps that can be made as well. Firstly, the player can 'hang off' the left side of a turtle, but attempting to do the same on the right side results in death. If the player jumps onto a home base with an alligator (and the 'gator vanishes after you jump, but before the player lands), Frogger will be killed, but he will ALSO make it home. Finally, left and right jumps on the top row of logs are sometimes much slower than usual - this is more likely to occur after previously eating a fly.

4. Another in-game bug is that the lady frog will sometimes be invisible, but will flash red when the player jumps onto the spot where she is.


Mark Robichek holds the official record for this game with 442,330 points.


A Frogger unit appears in the 1999 movie 'Magnolia'.


A bootleg of this game runs on the "Moon Cresta" hardware.


A bootleg of this game is known as "Frog".


Frogger inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Froggy's Lament' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album.


The TV show, Seinfeld, has an episode named 'The Frogger'. George and Jerry are in Mario's Pizza which is closing down, and they find a Frogger game still there. They realize that the high score of 860,630 points has George's initials GLC [George Louis Costanza]. They reminisce about the night it happened : "I was unstoppable!... Just the right amount of grease on the joystick".  George decides to buy the Frogger machine to immortalize his high score, but Jerry informs him that unplugging the game will erase all of the scores. Later, George tries in vain to call an electrician to help : "I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?". Kramer suggests an electrician who can help. George says, "Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me". George assembles a team and hatches a plan to salvage the game. But when he arrives, he finds the team playing the game, which has only three minutes of battery life left. They can't get it back in the closed pizzeria, but there is an open pharmacy across the street where it could be plugged in. George decides to push the machine across the highway, and an overhead shot of this feat looks much like the Frogger game itself, and the music from the game is played. At the end, George is unable to push the game onto the sidewalk and it gets destroyed by an oncoming truck.


MB (Milton Bradley) released a board game based on this video game (same name) the same year, 'One Wrong Leap Will Get You Squished And Splattered' : in this version of the game, 2 players face off, each with their own army of frogs, logs, and automobiles. Each turn, a player spends his movement points either moving his frogs toward their goal (the other side of the board), or moving logs and cars in an attempt to block or squash the other player's frogs. Complete with 'bonus points' for landing on flies, this is actually a pretty faithful interpretation of the video-game; but far too simple to have any long-lasting interest. More of a curiosity for video game enthusiasts than anything.


Frogger also spawned a cartoon series of the same name : Ruby-Spears Productions. Produced By Joe Ruby, Ken Spears. Originally aired September 17, 1983 as part of 'Saturday Supercade' on CBS.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your frog will start at the bottom of the screen. You will have 60 seconds to move your frog up 10 spaces and successfully put it in their home. If you are successful, then you will try to put a frog in the next home and so on until you fill up all five homes with frogs. When you do this, you progress to the next level.


* Note the traffic flow of the 2 parts. The cars travel on the roadway from left to right while the logs, turtles, crocodiles, etc. travel on the water lanes in the following direction :

a) Lanes #1, #3, and #5 go from right to left.

b) Lanes #2 and #4 go from left to right.


* First, you must cross the highway. You will become road kill if a vehicle hits you or you hit a vehicle. Try to find 'lanes' in between the vehicles. You must plan for gaps to form in the first three lanes so you don't become trapped. The vehicles in the first three lanes move slowly enough that you can jump side to side with reasonable safety.


* Lane #4 is the dangerous lane. Depending on how much time you are taking, the cars may pick up speed even though it shows slow on the chart. Keep this in mind when you are moving your frog.


* At level 3, a snake will either be in the median or on the log in water lane #3. The snake is deadly to your frog and you cannot hop over it.


* The turtles are pretty easy to navigate over in water lanes #1 and #4. Be wary of the diving turtles and only use them as a quick bypass to a more solid footing. If your frog is on a diving turtle when it dives, your frog will drown.


* Again, time your jumps to coincide with the logs and turtles to ensure you will always have a solid footing to jump to. As the levels progress, you will have less things you can jump to.


* You can jump on the backs of the crocodiles and otters. Just don't get near their mouths or they are apt to turn your frog into a meal.


* You may see a purple frog hopping around on the log in water lane #2. Just cross over this frog to give it a piggyback ride to your home and get an extra 200 points.


* Watch out for the snakes, they sometimes like to ride on the logs. If you see a snake on a log, jump back to solid footing.


* Your frog cannot 'wrap-around' the screen so make sure you bail off before that footing disappears off the edge of the screen or your frog will come out the other side in a squished condition.


* By that same token, if you have the time and necessary footing, you can hold out until the fly appears in your home before you settle your frog in. That's another 200 points.


* Try to fill in the two end homes before going for the middle. The hardest home to get into is the left-hand one (home #1) since everything in lane #5 goes from right to left up here. This may have to bounce back to lane #4 so you can get a good shot at your home.


* Speaking of getting your frogs into their homes. You must hit exact center or your frog will die. Also, keep in mind that crocodiles like to randomly appear in your home. Make sure that your home is clear before trying to settle your frog down into it.


* Again, if you waste too much time, the things on the river will move quicker so you will have to adjust your strategy accordingly.


* When the game is playing in demo mode, you can control the frog. When the frog reaches water lane #4, you can control the frog's movements until you move either up or down.


* If you jump into your home at the same time the crocodile is leaving your home, you will be credited with making to your home but you will still lose a frog in the process.


* You can dangle your frog from the left side of the turtles but not the right side.


* Your side to side movements in water lane #5 may be slow and sluggish.


* The purple frog will sometimes be invisible. The only time you know its there is when you jump on it. It will then ride on your back to your home.

Front Line (c) 11/1982 Taito.


Front Line is Taito America Corporation's action war game. Traveling through enemy territory the player must accomplish the ultimate mission or meet a violent end : capture the enemy fort and win total victory.


The journey begins slowly with the player armed with a gun (special Gun Control) and hand grenades. Quickly he becomes a target for enemy soldiers who also have guns and grenades. Moving faster, he races past trees that hide the enemy who now unleash an ambush barrage of bullets and bombs. Even the ground he races over has been booby-trapped with land mines.


If the player successfully makes it through this deadly obstacle course, he meets an even greater challenge... the enemy is attacking with tanks! His gun now useless, the player can stand and fight with grenades or leap into his own tank (special Tank button) and counter attack.


The battle rages on all fronts as the player fights for his life, racing for cover behind brick walls while outrunning grenades thrown by soldiers in fox holes. It's all-out war when the player jumps from his tank into a larger one with greater firepower.


Now comes the final test of victory as the enemy's fort looms in sight. The player must leap from the tank and run through a hail of bullets to throw one final grenade. The white flag heralds total victory!

Galaga '88 (c) 1987 Namco.


Galaga '88 is an updated version of the old favorite, Galaga, with more invaders and more player firepower. Galaga '88 gives players a chance to once again repel the invaders from the Galagan Kingdom. One or two players can try their hand at fighting the invaders. This time the Galagans have four more allies, each with unique weapons and defenses that a player must overcome.


By destroying special enemies or obstacles the player can get 'items'. When a player has two items, he can warp to another sector to confront more Galagan ships with new strategies. In the Challenge Rounds, the player shoots down as many invaders as possible as the Galagans dance to a waltz, tango, march or jazz tune.


The player selects single or dual ship power. The objective is to destroy all the Galagan foes in each of the 29 sectors of the galaxy, with each sector more difficult than the last.


Unique Features :

* More opponents. In addition to Boss, Goei and Zago, the original Galagan crew, Don, Nin, Ban, and Gan have been added. Each of the Galagans has a unique way of challenging the players.

* Different types of ships. Players can choose single or dual ships (if the game option is set for dual and single). When the player retrieves a dual ship from the Boss's tractor beam, it turns into a triple ship with ten times the power of a single ship.

* Challenge Rounds. In the Galaga '88 Challenge Rounds the Galagan invaders dance to a waltz, tango, Sousa march or jazz tune, while the player shoots down Galagans to earn bonus points.

* Warping to a new sector. By destroying particular enemies or obstacles and capturing two of their items, the player can warp to the next sector.

* Player challenge. Each sector has different mix of Galagans with different strategies to be overcome.

* Win back captured ships. The player can win back ships captured in the Boss Galaga's tractor beam. When the player destroys the Boss, the ships are released. If the player retrieves them, the ships become dual ships if they were single and triple if they were double.

* High Score Mode. Upon completing a game, a player can enter his initials if he is among the top eight scorers on the game.

This title was usually sold as a conversion kit (most games were back in 1988). It used the standard JAMMA harness. The marquee showed a gold 'Galaga '88' logo on a field of red teardrops. The side-art had the same picture as the marquee, but without the background. The control panel featured a single 2-Way joystick and a fire button on either side (along with start buttons and game instructions). Many of these machines will have 8-Way joysticks instead of the original 2-Way ones, they are interchangeable as far as this game is concerned.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Perfect Bonus : shoot all 40 enemies in the 'That's Galactic Dancin' bonus stages to receive a 'Perfect' bonus just like the challenging stages in the original "Galaga". Initially this bonus is 10,000 points but it increases on later 'That's Galactic Dancin' stages.


* Secret Bonus : during the 'That's Galactic Dancin' bonus stage, don't touch anything : don't shoot and don't move (simply don't touch the joystick); at the end of the dance and after getting ZERO hits and ZERO points, you'll receive a 10,000 points 'Secret Bonus'.


* Pick up two blue items to get a bonus and go to the next harder dimension after completing a 'That's Galactic Dancin' stage. This bonus is also initially 10,000 points but increases each time you achieve it.


* Pick up a purple item which appears on later stages to immediately get a triple firepower ship.

Galaga (c) 1981 Namco.


GALAGA is a space fighter game where you are the pilot of a spaceship referred to in-game as a Fighter, stationed in space, to defend your planet against the on-coming hordes of invaders. Your mission is to destroy as many of the enemy ships as possible.


These invaders arrive in convoys. They will attack you while swerving back and forth across the screen, dropping bombs all the while. A certain breed of the enemy ships, the Boss Galaga, can put out a tractor beam and capture your Fighter. That Fighter changes color from white to red and stays with that particular Boss Galaga for the rest of the game. You can get it back by destroying the Boss Galaga that captured it while they are both attacking your current Fighter. If you do this, the rescued Fighter changes color again from red back to white, and links up with your current Fighter. This doubles your fire power.


As your skill level increases, the number of attackers coming at you at any one time and the speed with which the enemy ships attack is gradually increased, plus their attack patterns become more and more complex.


Bonus Fighters are awarded to you periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values ('Bonus Life' dip switch setting). Each enemy ship has an assigned point value (see Scoring below).


2 major new features of your GALAGA game are :

1) The player is given the chance to double his fire power at certain points throughout the game.

2) The game has a rapid fire (automatic firing) option whereby the player just holds the FIRE button down and his space fighter continues to fire at the Galaga army in bursts of 2 missiles each.


To double his fire power, the player must let one of his Fighters be captured by one of the Boss Galagas and then rescue it (CAUTION : If the player's last Fighter is captured, the game is over). The Boss Galaga ships MUST BE SHOT TWICE to destroy them. When shot once, they change color from green to blue. When shot again, they explode. The rescued Fighter then links up with the one that rescued it and they now work as a team - both moving together and firing at the same time.


The object of the game is to survive as long as possible while destroying as many enemies as you can. As you do this, each following convoy of enemies will be harder to destroy.


The game is made up of convoys of invading alien space ships. You, as defender, try to destroy as many convoys as you can.


The convoys are displayed one at a time at the top of the screen. They are made up, in order from top to bottom on the convoy, of Boss Galaga, Butterflies (red/white bug ships), and Bees (blue/yellow bug ships). These ships fly onto the screen from different angles, going by your position (giving you an opportunity to shoot them down) and then take up their positions in the convoy formation at the top of the screen.


In the 1st STAGE, the enemies do not drop bombs on you as they fly onto the screen and go by your position. However, they will in later stages.


After the convoy (or what's left of it after you've finished shooting at them as they fly onto the screen and head for their respective spots in the convoy formation) finishes forming up at the top of the screen, enemies will begin peeling off and diving at your fighter. They weave back and forth across the screen dropping bombs all the while.


The Boss Galaga can put out a tractor beam and capture your Fighter. When this happens, that Fighter changes color from white to red and stays with that particular enemy Boss Galaga for the rest of the game. You can get your Fighter back by destroying the Boss Galaga that captured it while they are both attacking your current fighter. The Boss Galaga MUST BE SHOT TWICE to destroy them. When shot once, they change color from green to blue. When shot again, they explode. If, however, you mistakenly shoot the captured fighter, it will be destroyed.


Bees and Butterflies will explode as soon as they are hit by one of your shots.


Starting with Stage 4, a squadron of special bonus enemies called "transforms" begin appearing. They're called transforms because a Bee will begin pulsating and move out of formation to change into these bonus enemies. They appear in the form of yellow scorpions in Stages 4, 5, and 6, green ships from "Bosconian" in Stages 8, 9, and 10, and Galaxian Flagships in Stages 12, 13, and 14. After that, the three different transforms repeat in the same order. Transforms are always worthwhile targets because they are not very aggressive and are worth more than the other enemies, and if all 3 transforms are destroyed, bonus points will be awarded.


When you destroy the last ship of a convoy, the screen gives the following display centered on the monitor screen : STAGE (and the number of the next stage).


The only exception to this would be when the next STAGE is a CHALLENGING STAGE. The first CHALLENGING STAGE comes at the end of the 2nd STAGE. After this, they come at the end of every third STAGE. When you destroy the last ship of the 2nd, 6th, 10th, 14th, 18th, etc. convoys, you will see this display centered on the monitor screen : CHALLENGING STAGE.


A CHALLENGING STAGE is made up of 40 enemy ships that fly by your fighter in 5 groups of 8 ships each while describing varying patterns. They do not drop any bombs and the object is to shoot down as many of them as you can. When you shoot down one COMPLETE formation of 8 enemy ships, bonus points (between 1000 and 3000 depending on the STAGE) are added to your score. If you can destroy all 40 GALAGAS, you will be awarded a SPECIAL BONUS OF 10000 POINTS for that particular CHALLENGING STAGE.


As you destroy more convoys, the attacks on you become faster, are in a more rapid succession, and follow trickier flight patterns. For instance, they will try to trap you in a cross fire, or in one corner of the screen, etc. You've really got to watch them closely. If they can't bomb you, they'll ram you in the rear. That's one of their favorite tricks, to fly in a circle and come up behind you.

- TRIVIA -


Although Galaga was a superior game, it didn't sell the large numbers that its predecessor did. One of the first games with a bonus stage.


The game 'rolls over' at 999,990 points. The player 1 score counter is 6 digits, but the player 2 counter is 7 digits. Therefore, most good players start a 2 players game and play exclusively on the player 2 side so their score won't 'roll over' at 999,990. After the 1,000,000 mark, new Fighters are no longer awarded.


What happens after finishing the 255th stage depends upon the skill level set in the DIP switches:

* On the easy skill, the game resets.

* On the medium skill, the game flips to "Stage 0" which plays as a strange cross between the 2nd challenging stage and a regular level where the enemies shoot.  The game will advance to stage 1 after completion, and the game will get easy again.

* On the hard skill setting, the words "Stage 0" stay on the screen forever.  No more enemies ever appear. The player can continue to move the ship and fire, but there is no way to advance to the next level, or to die. To play again, the machine must be reset.

* On the hardest skill, the game flips to "Stage 0" which plays like stage 1 (no extra enemies when flying onto the screen), but it is still as difficult as stage 255.  The game will advance to stage 1 after completion, and the game will get easy again.


If you have more than 7 extra men, the marker for the screen will only show 7 1/2 (!) men remaining. Additional extra men will still be credited, even though they won't show on the screen.


The Bees are also referred to as 'Zako' and the Butterflies are also referred to as 'Goei'.


Stephen Krogman holds the official record for this game with 15,999,990 points.


A Galaga unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the in 1983 movie 'Spring Break' (being played by one of the main characters), in the 1984 movie 'The Karate Kid', and in the 1987 movie 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Easter Egg :

1) Enter service mode.

2) Keep B1 pressed and enter the following sequence : Right(x5), Left(x6), Right(x3), Left(x7). '(c) 1981 NAMCO LTD.' will be added at the bottom of the screen.


* Enemy Stop Shooting : on the first stage, kill everything but the 2 Bees in the bottom left corner. Then just wait, dodging the enemies' shots, until the enemy no longer drops any shots towards you. After the enemies stop firing, let them pass for 2 more trips and then kill them. For the rest of the game, the enemies will not drop shots. It will take approximately 15 minutes for the enemies to quit shooting at you, so this trick requires a lot of patience. Note : in a 2-player game, only one person has to do the cheat for both players to benefit. But as soon as 1 of the players game is over the enemies begin shooting again.


* (BUG) Take The Control Of The Fighter For Free : during the Galaga demo, the Boss Galaga comes down and tries to tractor-beam up the player's ship. As soon as that tractor-beam starts, the player can take control of the ship in the demo. The player has 2 choices here and this will effect how the game handles this bug : If the player allows himself to be captured, the demo will continue as normal and he has the option of controlling the player Fighter or not. The player can choose whether to save the captured Fighter, try to complete the level, etc. The demo mode will complete after 30 seconds and the high-score screen will appear. If the player takes control of the Fighter and destroys the Boss Galaga with the tractor beam, some of the characters on the screen will freeze while others are still moving and doing what they are suppose to be doing. This will last 15-20 seconds, then the game will go to the high score screen.


* Challenging stages are easier if the high score numbers are used to refine your aim. These tips assume a 6-digit high score :

1) On the first 2 challenging stages, aim your ships so that your left set of bullets falls between the second and third numbers in the high score list.

2) On subsequent challenging stages, aim one set of your bullets between the first and second numbers in the high score list (if the units come from the left) or between the last and next-to-last numbers (if the units come from the right). This will allow you to hit descending enemies at the highest possible point.


* Here Is A neat (and useless) Galaga Trick : it is possible to end the game with a 200% ratio. The 200% hit-miss ratio trick can only be done with your first shot of the game. When the game starts, don't move, and fire only one shot. If you time it correctly, 2 enemies will be killed at once. Let your remaining Fighters be destroyed, and presto : a better-than-perfect result.

Galaga 3 (c) 1984 Namco.


The general gameplay formula is the same as it was for both "Galaxian" and "Galaga", with the player controlling a spaceship that moves along the bottom of the screen and fires up at the enemy formations at the top of the screen. Movement is not confined to left and right, however, as players can also move anywhere in the bottom half of the screen.


The insectoïd enemies fire down upon the player's ship, and both individual and groups of enemies will break away from the armada to make attack runs on the player. Most of the Galagans can be killed with a single shot, and shooting specific enemies will earn the player a tractor beam. This gives them the ability to capture one or more enemy ships; these prisoner ships will then sit alongside the player's ship and add to its firepower.


Every few levels, players will enter a 'Challenging Stage', where formations of enemy ships will fly in and out of the screen. Players must shoot them as many times as possible to try and spell out a word.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Easter Egg :

1) Enter service mode.

2) Keep Start and Button 1 pressed, move joystick Left until sound reaches 19. '(c) 1984 NAMCO' will appear on the screen.


* These tips are all variations on the same theme :

1) On level 1, allow all of the enemies to appear and fly into formation without shooting any of them. After the boss alien appears (the one that carries the tractor beam attachment), you'll see a pulsar similar to the ones the aliens appear from fly from just above the boss alien to the middle-right of the screen. Once it's gone by, shoot only the second alien from the left in the bottom row of the formation. A 'Special' flag will appear just below where it was; pick it up and you'll get a bonus ship.

2) In Parsec 1, go up to the very front and wait for all the bugs to come out. Then kill the 2nd bug from the left in the bottom row to make the special flag appear. Now, when the boss is coming down, move your ship and kill yourself by touching it. Don't touch the blaster head, just the boss. Your ship is turned into the blue one, and go get the special flag.


* Another Approach To The Same Situation : At the start of the first round, push straight up until you stop. DON'T shoot! Just sit there and let all the bugs form. Right after the last row of bugs get into formation a star will shoot from the top left side of the screen to the bottom right. If you time this right you can get up to 5 shots on it. After about 10 hits on the star (it will come out at random times during the game) it will transform your ship into a new ship that can shoot 3 shots on the screen (3 shots vertically in a row) instead of just 2.

Galaxian (c) 1979 Namco.


Galaxian is a legendary single-screen shoot-em-up that took everything that made Taito's ground-breaking "Space Invaders" so good, and improved upon it on every level. Each screen starts with a wave of multi-coloured aliens moving left and right at the top of the screen; the aliens quickly break ranks and start dive-bombing the Galaxip (player's ship) - either in single units or in groups of 3 - dropping multiple missiles as they descend. All of the aliens need to be destroyed before the player can progress to the next wave.


CAST OF CHARACTERS

Galaxip : This is the name of the ship which you control at the bottom of the screen.


Galaxian : These attacking aliens come in 3 varieties, blue, purple, and red. They begin in formation at the top of the screen and will occasionally swoop down to attack you before returning to their position in the formation.


Flagship : At least two of these appear at the top of the formation at the start of each stage. They will swoop down to attack with one or two red Galaxians if any are nearby. If a flagship is one of the last enemies left of the screen, it will run away and appear as a third Flagship at the start of the next stage.


- TECHNICAL -


This was the first title to use the now familiar 'Namco Cabinet', which was used for Galaxian, "Galaga", "Pac-Man", "Ms. Pac-Man". Several other titles used nearly identical cabinets as well. These machines are white, with painted sideart of a green dragonfly alien (done up in blue, green. and black). The marquee is rather large and displays a blue and green 'Galaxian' logo (which is painted on a sheet of glass, they don't make them like that anymore). The control panel and monitor bezel are not highly decorated, but do feature some game instructions. Finally this machine uses neon green t-molding (edge trim), it is difficult to find replacement trim in that same exact shade.


The earliest Galaxian machines used a 25inches G02 monitor, but later machines shipped with the standard 19inches Electrohome G07 monitor. Any normal standard resolution arcade monitor should work as a replacement. "Pac-Man" PCBs will work in Galaxian machines, but require a 4-Way joystick, instead of the 2-Way model that Galaxian normally has. The sound pinout is also different, so one would need to rewire the connector to hear any Pac-Man sounds. You can also plug a Galaxian PCB into a Pac-Man. Again, the sound would need to be wired up at the connector and you'd have to push UP on the joystick to fire :)

- TRIVIA -


Space battles of all kinds played a major role during the golden age of video games. With the introduction of Galaxian in 1979, players were transported to the most colorful and challenging space battle yet.

This was the first video game released with 100 percent of its graphics displayed in true R.G.B. color.


* A place in video game history : "Galaxian captivated the minds of quite a few arcade enthusiasts," said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "It was a relatively early entry in the golden age of video games, and it capitalized on the enthusiasm created by the earlier video game classic, "Space Invaders", while providing a more colorful, enjoyable, and demanding gaming experience.

Galaxian had smarter bad guys than "Space Invaders", and it demanded that the player really pay attention to what was going on. And there were no shields, like many games have today. You really had to stay on the ball. Galaxian also had great sound and used elements that have since become standard -- such as flags and other symbols to mark the player's progression through different levels of game play.".


* The great 25-cent escape : "Galaxian definitely gets an enthusiastic response," Lindsey said. "In fact, I deliberately position the game near the entrance of the museum. Often it's the first game people go to." Lindsey often sees parents trying to convey to their child the excitement of these great games. "It is funny for me when I see a father trying to explain a game to his kid. Junior really just wants to get on the game and figure it out, and Dad wants to do a demo. Dad starts instructing Junior while Junior is sort of looking around, wondering how he can get away. But Dad continues, busily explaining the nuances of the game, which he knows Junior can't get on the first play. This all shows the enthusiasm that a certain generation still has for these terrific games."

With or without a parent's help, Lindsey sees a younger generation embracing the classic arcade games. "Kids by themselves will actually do quite well on these games," Lindsey said. "I'm somewhat surprised when I see how good kids are at picking up games. I sort of think that because I'm older, I should be able to play better, and that's not always the case with video games. That's a lesson an entire generation has had to learn.".


* Namco notes : Galaxian was one of Namco's first video games, and engineers throughout the company were gathered into a special team. As the game neared completion, the engineers suspected they had created a good game because other Namco employees were extremely "excited and crazy about the game." Once Galaxian was released, they knew they had a winner because, as one Namco engineer reported, "People [at the arcades] piled their coins onto the game cabinets to keep playing, and those who were waiting were very irritated because their turn never came. There were huge lines of people around each machine.".


The Galaxian Flagship became a trademark of Namco as it makes cameo appearances in other Namco classics :

"Pac-Man" and "Pac-Man Plus" as the prize in levels 9 and 10.

"Galaga" as one of the 3 enemies that a Zako (normal blue/yellow bug ship) can transform into when it splits into 3.

"Dig Dug" as the prize in levels 16 and 17.

"Super Pac-Man" as the food item of level 15.

"Pac & Pal" as the power-up item of levels 1 and 2.

A silver-gray version appears as an enemy in later areas of "Super Xevious".

A 3-D version appears as a prize in later levels of "Pac-Mania".

The board layout in level 5 of "Quester".


Gary Whelan holds the official record for this game with 1,114,550 points, achieved the 24th August 2006 at Dukinfield in the UK.


A Galaxian unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'. It is also heard (but not seen) in the 1987 James Bond movie 'The Living Daylights'.

The only code difference between the original Namco version and the licensed Midway version is that the BONUS GALAXIP text is printed on a different line.


In clone Namco Set 2:

* Lives dip switch can be set to 3 or 5 lives. The default is 3 lives.

* Extra life dip switch can be set to 4000 (meaning a bonus Galaxip at 4000 points), 5000 points, 7000 points, or None (meaning no bunus Galaxip at any time). The default is 4000.

Flagship attacking with 2 escorts, flagship killed AFTER both escorts : 800 points


* The maximum possible score shown is 999,990. Scores higher than this roll back to zero, but the high score will show the last score achieved before the rollover, which can vary from 999,990 to 999,200.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* The action starts immediately as soon as you start your game. The Galaxians will be set up in formation and your Galaxip will be placed in the middle of the bottom of the screen. The action starts immediately. You can only have one shot in the air at any time so plan your shots accordingly. The game starts off slowly with only 2 or 3 Galaxians attacking your Galaxip at one time. They will drop 3 to 4 laser shots. As the waves progress, more Galaxians will come after your Galaxip until you will usually have 10-15 at any one time swooping down on it.


Each wave starts out with the Galaxians in formation, in the following quantities (in order from top to bottom) :

Flagships : 2 (plus any that have escaped from battle in the previous wave, up to a maximum of 4 altogether)

Red Galaxians (Escorts) : 6 (in 1 row, directly above the flagships)

Purple Galaxians : 8 (in 1 row, directly above the red Galaxians)

Blue Galaxians : 30 (in 3 rows of 10, directly above the purple Galaxians)


Gold and Red are special enemies : they create convoys. Gold flagships have other special properties (see below). Purple and Blue are regular enemies.


* The Galaxip can fire only shot on the screen at a time. It is possible to kill 2 enemies with one shot if they are flying extremely close to each other.


* Missiles shot at the formation which miss by going between columns or near an outer edge of a column, will cause the formation to pause its left-right movement for a very short moment. This will usually, but not always, prevent missed shots near the columns from hitting the enemies in the upper rows of the formation which might otherwise be hit by moving into the shot as it flies by.


* Enemies peel away from the formation and attack the Galaxip. Enemies fire at the Galaxip during their attack, but they can-t fire after they pass an invisible horizontal line just above the player-s ship.


* Enemies always begin attack runs from the edges of the formation, never from the middle. This also applies to flagships but it is not readily observable unless there are 3 or 4 flagships present.


* A 'swarm' is triggered by either of 2 criterion :

1. The total number of enemies in formation is 3 or less.

2. The total number of blue and purple enemies in formation is zero. This can occur when there are many flagships and escorts still present in formation.


* When the 'swarm' starts, enemies that begin an attack do not return to formation : they keep attacking. Once started, a 'swarm' can only be ended by killing all of the enemies and/or letting them escape, or by the Galaxip getting hit. 


* Before the 'swarm' starts, enemies that attack, which are not killed, return to the formation. Since these enemies were on the edge of the formation and able to attack once, they are very likely to attack again soon.


* When not in 'swarm', a maximum of 4 regular enemies can attack at any one time.


* Flagships and convoys can attack at any time as long as another convoy attack is not already commencing; only one convoy attack can happen at a time.


* A flagship will always create a convoy with the maximum number of escorts available to it, unless the 'swarm' has started.


* The flagships 'capture' up to 3 red escorts while they are in formation :  Whenever there is a flagship in formation directly above an escort or above it to one side, that escort is captured and cannot attack on its own. This capture effect ends when a 'swarm' begins.


* The flagships can escape from the battle only if all three red escorts under their place in the formation have been killed. Flagships that escape will appear on the next attack wave, up to a maximum of 4 flagships at the start of any wave.


* When an attacking flagship is killed, all enemies stop firing for a short period of time. If this kill occurs before the 'swarm', there will also be no new attacks from the formation during this period. These benefits never occur for killing a flagship that is in formation.


* The flags which count the rounds show a maximum of round 48; rounds 48 and up are shown as round 48. However if round 256 is achieved, the flags start to roll over, but with some graphical glitches; the flags that were showing round 48 begin to get overwritten, one at a time. This results in the big 10-flags being cut in half by the regular flags which start to appear, until all 4 of the 10-flags are replaced by small ones. 16 single flags show during rounds 256+8 and 256+9 (rounds 264 and 265). The glitch ends at round 256+10 (266), which shows a single 10 flag.


* After wave 1, it is possible to kill any one enemy, even a flagship, in a brand new formation by shooting at just the right time and place before the formation teleports in at the start of a new round.


* The Galaxians that come down in a smooth pattern are the easiest to kill plus their shots are easy to avoid. The hard ones (usually the blue Galaxians) to kill are the ones where the Galaxian 'bounces' from side-to-side dropping shots since those shots cover a very large area.


* The corners can be a death trap. When the Galaxians come down firing, their shots do not come straight down but they angle toward the direction that the Galaxian is traveling. In addition, the Galaxians have a tendency to 'charge' into the corners. You get the points if a Galaxian rams your Galaxip but you also lose your Galaxip in the process.


* The Flagships are the big points in the game. Try to avoid shooting the red fighters since they act as escorts for the Flagship. Wait until a Flagship comes down with two escorts. If you can't get aligned to take all three out quickly, let them pass. If you do get a good angle on them, you will have to fire quickly to pick off the two escorts first, then the Flagship. If you hit the Flagship first, you get significantly less points.


* Do not stop moving. If you do, you will be caught in a crossfire. The Galaxians tend to leave small areas of safety open between their shots. Also, make sure you are constantly hitting their formation to reduce their numbers (again, don't kill off the red ones).


* As you progress into the higher waves, the Galaxians tend to move quicker, fly more erratic patterns, and 'gang' up on your Galaxip. Plan accordingly for this.

Considered as a hack of "Galaxian", this game seems more like a hack of "Moon Alien" by Nichibutsu, but with the graphics changed to look more like "Galaxian". This explains why the shots move with the ship and why the fuel gauge is there. Galaxian also didn't use a 'title screen' formed with graphics, it went straight through to 'We are the Galaxians'. Also, the rate of fire is much faster and the alien's movements are more random.

Galaxy Rescue (c) 1979 Taito.


Galaxy Rescue is a combination two-dimensional simple flight simulator and two-dimensional shooter. You start the game by floating within your mother ship. You then either must release your lander or after a pre-determined period of time, the mother ship will forcibly eject it. You first have to navigate through 6 rows of asteroids to make it to one of the landing platforms. You have 6 platforms initially but each landing will eliminate one since there is 1 platform per astronaut you have to rescue. On your return trip up, the screen changes and now you have saucers trying to destroy you with laser fire. Again, you will either have 3 or 6 rows of saucers depending if there are meteors in the area. You then must successfully land in the docking bay of the mother ship to get credit for a successful rescue of 1 astronaut.

- TRIVIA -


This game is better known as "Lunar Rescue"


Galaxy Rescue was the follow-up game to "Space Invaders". Unfortunately, it was released at the same time as "Asteroids", which pretty much eclipsed most games until the 1980's. Galaxy Rescue is actually a little more complicated then its Space Invaders cousin. You actually have to keep track of a few more things to successfully make it through this game. This is one of those 'sleeper' games that didn't get a big following since Asteroids was also out.


Before stage 4, you get a cute intermission from the aliens of "Space Invaders" telling you to 'Fight'.


A bootleg of this game is known as Destination Earth".


- UPDATES -


In "Destination Earth" the humans run to the spaceship after it lands, in "Lunar Rescue" and Galaxy Rescue the pace is more like a walk.


- SCORING -


Large Saucer : 30 points

Small Saucer: 50 points

Platform : 50, 100, 150 points


Each man rescued has an increasing value until stage four where it is at its maximum. The values are:

Stage 1 : 50 points

Stage 2 : 100 points

Stage 3 : 150 points

Stage 4 : 300 points

Every stage after stage 4 is 300 points.


Fuel remaining is added to your score (i.e. if you have 560 Fuel left, then add 560 points to your score) at the end of a wave.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


When you start the game, your lander will be sitting in the docking bay of the mother ship. You can release your lander by pressing the firing button or wait until the mother ship forcibly ejects you. It's better to do it yourself lest the mother ship ejects you on top of an asteroid.


* Fuel is a precious commodity in this game, use it sparingly. You only have 800 units of fuel to rescue 6 men. If you burn all your fuel off on the first rescue, you will have nothing to fall back on for the other 5.


* When you leave the mother ship, try to navigate through the asteroids without using any fuel. Since your lander doesn't accelerate during the fall, you will be going at a constant speed down. Try to maneuver between the rocks to land on a platform. You also don't need to decelerate when landing, you just land.


* Try to knock out the harder platforms first. This means, land on the harder to reach ones on the sides first. A good strategy is to get the right hand-one first, then the two left-hand ones, then finish by landing on the three in the middle.


* If you must use fuel, use quick bursts to get into position to land on a platform. Fuel burns up very quickly in this game so some quick shots to the thrusters should keep you out of trouble. Keep in mind, as the waves progress, the asteroids move faster and become more numerous.


* Once you've landed, the little guy will run over and get in your lander. The screen will then change and you will see 3 to 6 rows of saucers blocking your path. Again, as the waves progress, the saucers and meteors get faster and more numerous. There are a couple of different strategies for this section :

1) If you only see 3 lower rows of saucers, look to the upper right or left corner. More than likely, some meteors will be coming diagonally down to the opposite corner. The best solution is to quickly blast a path through the saucers and get above the meteors trajectory.

2) If you see 6 rows of saucers, then you need to blast a path through them to get to your mother ship. Keep in mind that the fire button acts as a dual fire/thrust button. When you fire, you accelerate yourself up just a bit. In other words, no point blank shooting or you may end up taking out the saucer with your lander. When you have cleared a path, use the fire button to get yourself quickly above the saucers.


* The saucers firing just drop their shots on you. Because of their numbers, you may find yourself surrounded by enemy fire. The best solution is again to blast a path through them. Once a saucer is destroyed, it doesn't come back. Also keep in mind that you can only have one shot on the screen at a time.


* Once you get 1 row from the bottom of the mother ship, it will stop and open its docking bay door. If you are too far away, you will fail to dock with the mother ship and get destroyed by the top of the screen. If you hit the side of the mother ship, the man you are rescuing will unfortunately fall from your lander to his death to the planet below. Plan out the best strategy to make sure that you stay in the middle so you can catch the mother ship with minimal effort.

Galivan - Cosmo Police (c) 1985 Nichibutsu.


A single player shooting/platform game in which the player runs and jumps around a colourful, multi-directional scrolling cave system. A variety of spacecraft and aliens attack in waves and must be killed or avoided. The player starts the game as an unarmed human with only the ability to kick and punch, but picking up a POW item will give encase the human in a robot suit and arm the player with a gun. Collecting the blue POW while in the suit awards the player with a beam weapon for a limited time, while the red POW gives the player a three shot cannon. POW items are dotted throughout the levels and can also be gained by shooting the blue robot aliens.


The player's character has an energy bar that decreases when the player is attacked, and should this fall below halfway, the robot suit will be lost and the player will once again be an unarmed human. Collecting a POW item will restore the player's energy, if a POW is collected while wearing the suit, however, the player's energy will NOT be increased but their weapon will receive a power-up.

Gallop - Armed Police Unit (c) 09/1991 Irem.


A futuristic shoot-em-up from the creators of "R-Type" in which the player takes on the role of a futuristic policeman who must destroy criminal controlled ships.


As with most Irem shoot-em-ups, Gallop's weapons system is superb. As well as being equipped with the standard front-firing gun and ground targeting missiles (both of which can be upgraded with the retrieval of power-ups), the player's ship is armed with a homing laser that, when activated, emits a constant laser stream towards whatever enemies and bonus capsules are on screen. The laser has an 'Overheat' meter that depletes while the laser is in use. Once the meter is emptied the laser will stop working. The meter gradually refills allowing the player to continue using the laser.

Gaplus (c) 1984 Namco.


The 3rd game in Namco's classic "Galaxian" series, Gaplus picks up where 1981's "Galaga" left off. While maintaining the same classic 'look' of its predecessor, Gaplus's graphics a definite improvement over those of Galaga; the game's increased colour palette and subtle use of shading making the attacking aliens look rather more solid.


Another enhancement over its prequel is in the addition of a player-acquired 'Tractor Beam'. In Galaga, only the enemies had access to the beam; enabling them to capture one of the player's ships (the player then had to shoot the captor to release the ship). For the sequel, however, the player can now acquire the Tractor Beam. This is achieved by shooting one of the alien formation's 'generals' - a visibly more colourful alien than its comrades. The Tractor Beam will then activate for a limited time and any aliens the players captures (up to a maximum of six) will dock alongside the player's ship for enhanced firepower.


One final yet important addition is in the movement of the player's ship. In previous installments, the ship could only move left and right along the bottom of the screen; in Gaplus, however, the ship can now move UP the screen - although only to the halfway point. This is important as the alien's aggressive attack patterns will often see enemy craft swirling around the bottom of the play area.


As with "Galaga", Gaplus features regular 'challenge' stages, with benign aliens swooping across the screen for the player to shoot, in order to earn extra bonus points.


- TECHNICAL -


Gaplus machines came in an upright dedicated cabinet that was similar in appearance to the cabinet used on the original "Galaga". These machines were black and were decorated with multi-color stripes, and sticker sideart with a realistically drawn scene from the game. There were several different marquees made. The American Gaplus marquee had a blue 'Gaplus' logo surrounded by a scary looking bee. The 'World' version had a green 'Gaplus' logo. Finally, many machines in the US will be labeled "Galaga 3" on the marquee, but will have 'Gaplus' sideart and ROM chips (lots of lazy operators who didn't bother to install the whole name change kit, made these common). All Machines are decorated with red t-molding. The control panel has a single 8-Way joystick mounted in the center, with fire buttons on either side. This panel was not decorated at all, it was simply black. The monitor bezel had a few game instructions on it, but was not overly decorated either. The game itself was displayed on a 19'' Electrohome open frame monitor that was mounted vertically. This title uses the same wiring harness as "Galaga", and the 2 titles can be interchanged very easily. Many other games (such as "Dig Dug") use this same harness as well).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Easter Egg :

1) Enter service mode.

2) Keep Start and Button 1 pressed, move joystick Left until sound reaches 19. '(c) 1984 NAMCO' will appear on the screen.


* These tips are all variations on the same theme :

1) On level 1, allow all of the enemies to appear and fly into formation without shooting any of them. After the boss alien appears (the one that carries the tractor beam attachment), you'll see a pulsar similar to the ones the aliens appear from fly from just above the boss alien to the middle-right of the screen. Once it's gone by, shoot only the second alien from the left in the bottom row of the formation. A 'Special' flag will appear just below where it was; pick it up and you'll get a bonus ship.

2) In Parsec 1, go up to the very front and wait for all the bugs to come out. Then kill the 2nd bug from the left in the bottom row to make the special flag appear. Now, when the boss is coming down, move your ship and kill yourself by touching it. Don't touch the blaster head, just the boss. Your ship is turned into the blue one, and go get the special flag.


* Another Approach To The Same Situation : At the start of the first round, push straight up until you stop. DON'T shoot! Just sit there and let all the bugs form. Right after the last row of bugs get into formation a star will shoot from the top left side of the screen to the bottom right. If you time this right you can get up to 5 shots on it. After about 10 hits on the star (it will come out at random times during the game) it will transform your ship into a new ship that can shoot 3 shots on the screen (3 shots verticaly in a row) instead of just 2.

Gauntlet (c) 1985 Atari Games.


Gauntlet is a maze-based shoot-em-up for up to four players. Heavily influenced by classic fantasy conventions, players take on the role of either an Thor the Warrior, Thyra the Valkyrie, Merlin the Wizard, or Questor the Elf and must play cooperatively as they explore and fight their way through the enemy-packed mazes. Competitive play is encouraged as players must fight for the limited amount of food, treasure, magic potions and power-up items that litter the dungeons. 


Each of Gauntlet's four characters posess different strengths and weaknesses: Thyra has great armour, Thor is best at hand-to-hand combat, Questor has the fastest speed, and Merlin has the best ability to use magic. The object of the game is simply to survive as long as possible while exploring Gauntlet's mazes in search of treasure, food, magic potions and ultimately, the exit that leads to the next dungeon. 


The potions - shown as blue bottles - that litter the levels offer either improved character abilities (such as 'speed' or 'extra shot power') or can be used as a 'smart bomb', destroying some or all of the on-screen monsters. Potions are also the only way to kill the game's 'Death' character that appears in many of the stages. Magic potions can be kept and used at the player's discretion by pressing 'Magic' button, although each potion can only be used once. 


The first seven mazes are always the same, but from level eight onwards, players will find themselves on any one of over a hundred different mazes. If a player survives long enough, the mazes will be repeated in a different order. How long a player lasts depends upon the player's 'health' level. Health continually depletes as time progresses and further health is lost by contact with various monsters or their projectyles. Health can be replenished by consuming the food found in the mazes or by inserting more credits. The many treasure chests that litter the levels can be plundered for points, and collecting treasure increases a player's score multiplier when two or more players are playing the game.

- TRIVIA -


Released in December 1985.


Gauntlet was originally going to be called 'Dungeons' and was inspired not only by TSR's tabletop RPG, 'Dungeons & Dragons', but also by another Atari game called 'Dandy'. Dandy's creator, Jack Palevich, tried fruitlessly to get his name added to the list of credits in Gauntlet. In lieu of public recognition, Atari Games Corp gave Pelvich a Gauntlet cabinet, and he in turn agreed not to sue Atari.


Gauntlet's revolutionary, non-linear game-play gave players multiple choices, as they were no longer forced into taking a linear route through the game. Like 'Dungeons & Dragons', Gauntlet players could choose their own path, searching for keys, treasures, food and transporters to take them to other levels. Unlike most other games at the time, the player didn't always have to fight; a simpler route through the dungeon could sometimes be found, or players could simply try to make a run for it.


Another Gauntlet milestone was in the game's use of sound effects. Synthesized human voices had been used sporadically in games in the early eighties and while it had proved, on most occasions, to be moderately successful, was still considered something of a novelty. Gauntlet, however, revolutionized the concept of in-game speech and added immeasurably to the game's superb atmosphere. The deep timbre of Gauntlet's very own 'Dungeon Master' would guide players through the levels, informing them that 'Elf needs food, badly', or that 'Blue Wizard is about to die' and the always-good advice that is 'Don't shoot food.'


Note : The game contains exactly 212 sounds (including digitized voices, effects and musics).


Approximately 8,000 units were produced.


Note : There were 20 officially released versions (see Updates section for detailed info), including 6 '2-player' versions and various Spanish, German and Japanese versions. Counting 4-players English variants alone, there were 7 releases with various bug-fixes.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hints for Game Play : The following hints will help you use your health more effectively and score more points per coin :

1) Play cooperatively.

2) Allow the player with the best ability to use magic (usually Merlin the Wizard, unless one of the other players has acquired the magic potion for extra magic) to pick up the magic potions.

3) Save keys and potions and use them conservatively.

4) Pay attention to your marching order. Allow the players with the best fighting ability and armor (usually Thyra the Valkyrie and Thor the Warrior) to lead the way and fend off attacks.

5) Avoid contact with the ghosts : they take away your health very quickly and you cannot fight them hand-to-hand.


* If you remain motionless (or basically aimless) and stall off about 30 health, all of the doors will open. Everybody knows this, and the game even tells you about it. The game doesn't tell you that if you stall off about 200 health, all the walls will turn into exits! (work on Revision 6 and +) The game designers had to include this because there are some levels which require you to pick up a key before you exit. If you are already filled up with keys, and the doors are all gone, then it would be IMPOSSIBLE for you to exit, and you would starve to death. What they didn't anticipate, is that certain levels of the game which are really difficult, which would require you to take massive health losses to finish, become very simple if all the walls are exits. Or they can be effectively skipped altogether. Because the game has Monty-Hall levels with lots of food on them, you can use this cheat to only play levels which are a wash or increase your health dramatically, and cut your losses to 200 on all the really hard levels.


* The best character to play, in the LONG run, is the elf. His magic is just as good as the wizard's and his fight ability as good as Thor's. His ability to shoot through cracks in addition to all this (when he has the power potions) makes him the best. The Valkyrie is the worst, although some people regard this as a challenge...


* To manipulate the point value of Death, shoot him. Death's point value takes the following progression : 1000-2000-1000-4000-1000-6000-1000-8000, and then back to start. His value keeps from the previous game.


* You can kill Death painlessly by teleporting on top of him.


* Level 8 is the level that the previous game ended on. If you got a really good sequence of boards in a game and you want to repeat them, turn the machine off and on again after you've entered your high score.

Gauntlet II (c) 1986 Atari Games.


A sequel to the legendary original, released a year later. Atari, perhaps wisely, chose not to tinker with the core game-play to any great degree, instead opting to merely 'upgrade' the already excellent multi-player action that had created such a stir during the previous year.


Changes to the sequel included the ability for players to play whatever character they wanted, even if that character was already in play. The characters were now color-coded and players would find themselves taking on the role of 'Blue Elf', 'Green Wizard', etc. The in-game speech was altered from the original to allow for the new player definitions. Other changes included the ability to 'bounce' shots off walls, providing the correct item was found.


New potions and monsters were also added; the most notorious being the Fire-breathing Dragon. Defeating the creature would see the players rewarded with a permanent potion and a bag of treasure. Another notable addition was the wonderful 'It' monster : any player who was tagged by the creature would suddenly find that all of that level's creatures would ONLY chase him or her, completely ignoring the presence of the other players. The only way to remove this curse was to tag another player, thus making him or her 'it'.

- TRIVIA -


The original "Gauntlet" was released in 1985, with the Gauntlet II conversion kits coming out a year later, in August 1986. A lot of the original "Gauntlet" machines of the time were switched over to Gauntlet II cabinets. They tended to stay as Gauntlet II for some time, due to the relative scarcity of kits that would convert a "Gauntlet" cabinet to that of its sequel. The proper kits were uncommon until the late eighties, by which time four-player games were taking off in a big way.


Competition : Atari held a promotional competition to coincide with "Gauntlet II's" initial launch. If players followed the instructions the game gives before entering a secret room (the machine provides clues on how to enter the secret rooms whenever a hidden wall is shot away on any level), the player is greeted with a screen explaining that they had been awarded extra points and inviting the player to enter his or her name.

A six-digit code would then be given which the player could put onto a competition entry form. The first 500 entries drawn won Gauntlet II T-shirts, plus a chance of winning a $5000 savings bond. Machines can also be set (via dip switches) to suppress this screen, in which case players would get a screen saying '5000 points x coins = xxx' after doing the secret room. The contest ended in 1986.


Approximately 3,000 kits were produced.


Note : the game contains exactly 205 sounds! (including digitized voices, effects and musics), less than the first Gauntlet.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (That's Atari Music Vol.II : G.S.M. Atari Games 2 - PCCB-00070) on 21/09/1991.


- SCORING -


Key : 100 points.

Treasure : 100 - 500 points.

Each type of monster has a set score value.

Each generator is worth twice as many points as its associated monster.

Death : up to 6,000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Secret Rooms : to get to a secret room, perform a secret trick on a level. Some of the secret tricks are :

1) Teleporting into the exit.

2) Pushing a movable wall into the exit

3) Keeping all the super shots

4) Not using invulnerability (this is almost always a good idea anyway)

5) Not touching a fake exit

6) Teleporting on top of Death and/or acid blobs

7) Not taking ANYTHING (the tick trick comes in handy here)


* The hints it gives to the secret room don't necessarily apply to your current level, just as on "Gauntlet". The secret trick usually doesn't work, but it is always same for any given board. You're allowed one secret trick for every 15 levels or so.


* You can kill the acid blobs! Just drop 2 potions in quick succession. This works regardless of your magic ability. It also puts the dragon back to sleep momentarily (You can also kill them with a teleporter. If there's a teleporter handy, that is).


* The '?' foods are NOT random. Grab a '?' food on health mod 20 = 7 (i.e. 27, 47, 67, etc). You'll get 200 health.


* Couple of strategy notes :

1) Reflective shots make the dragon easier

2) Invulnerability makes him very easy

3) Remember that when generators aren't on the screen, they don't generate monsters.

4) If you are playing two+ player you can kill almost all dragons with one player diverting his attention, or using an indirect attack. For example : you can find shootable walls or just stand in the right spot askew from the dragon. He will try to flame instead of fire-ball. If done correctly, you will be standing a wall away from him. Then your partner can go around and shoot flame head while the dragon is flaming away.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* There are 2 Capcom 10,000 points in the game.

The 1st one is in the forest (second part of level 1) : Jump at the 4th tree 'before' the last plant.

The 2nd one is at level 3 : Enter a ditch, in the leftmost spot, after you have landed on the bottom of level 3; that is the place where you go to the dragon boss by simply running right.


* Turn Into A Frog : As soon as you become a duck, shoot a tombstone 15 times in a row and an angel character will appear. This angel will fire a bolt at you. Let it hit you and you'll become a frog.


* Frog Bug Trick : Wait until the timer reaches 0 :01 and then have the magician turn you into a frog, if he turns you into a frog as the timer runs out, Arthur becomes distorted (sprite broken) and the timer becomes crazy. But you can continue the play like this.


* Levitating Monsters : At level 6 (just after having beaten the big red guardian), kill the 5 skulls, then climb up the ladder to wake up the 2 doglike monsters. Go down again and walk right until you're blocked by the wall. Then wait for the monsters to stand just over you (possibly at the rightmost possible point), shoot at this very moment and it happens that they jump and remain in mid-air. It's not easy to do that, but you can manage to have both jumping and stuck. After that, you can safely climb up the ladder and walk while the monsters are moving above you without touching you. Don't shoot again, or they may jump up and go to the upper platform.


* Boss Tricks :

1) Dragon Trick - You can pass the level four dragon by fleeing! Just walk until music changes to boss theme (if you can't hear that, the spot is where you have the last two flames on the left of the screen), then go to extreme left : if everything is ok, the music should stop and the flames freeze. Go to the door to collect the key.

2) Demon Trick - To make disappear the demon boss at end of level five, try running away from him as fast as you can! Reach the floor with the hole in it and jump through it. If you have correct timing, you will fall in the pit, avoiding the moving platforms, and eventually escape the boss. Ogre boss tricks - The ogre bosses tend to jump when you fire, even if not directly at them. This is very useful in level six,when you can avoid losing your armor by activating the ogres, then going down the ladder and firing while holding your man in the same position where he starts at the beginning of the level.


* Other Tricks :

1) Weapon Trick - After having defeated a level boss(es),the knight can fire two or three "invisible shots"; if the man is facing the right border of the screen while doing so, the shots will reappear in the following stage. This can be exploited to kill some of the skulls at beginning of level 6 (soooo useful...).

2) Fire Bridge Trick - If the game difficulty level is not set to hard (you can check this by the zombies' speed), the fire bridge can be traversed by simply going right without stopping.

3) Weird Spots - In levels 5 and 6 there are spots where you can jump through the yellow rock background : usually getting blocked or killed. In level 6, the floor below the bosses' has an invisible hole in it at the extreme left : this can be used to the player's advantage.

4) Cemetery Glitch - Reach the last tomb before the devil, jump it and go right two or three steps. The knight should now be in front of a tree on the background. Don't go any further - go back, instead. Climb the first ladder you'll meet, then climb down the one on the left, which shouldn't be completely on the screen if you performed the trick correctly : surprise!

5) Warp Trick - This is very odd : by a strategy similar to the one to reveal the cemetery glitch (that is, fiddling with scroll), you can activate a 'level warp' in the platform section at the beginning of level 4. It involves going right, then trying to have some platform carry you beyond the 'scroll stops' line on the left. This should kill the knight and possibly make the next life start on the fire bridge or in level 5.


* Armor :

1) The first armor is in the cemetery, between the red devil's starting position and last money bag : jump there to catch it. In the forest,there's the infamous unreachable armor : to collect it you should reach a spot just above the money bag right after the first plant. This cannot be done by jumping.

2) There are 2 armors in the ice palace. One can be gotten by walking left off the topmost platform; the other will fall right in front of the inferior plant by roaming around the other plant's location.

3) There are 2 armors in the blue cave. The first one is obtained by climbing the leftmost ladder and falling off the ledge. To get the second, perform a well-placed jump (you have to cross some precise point in mid-air while falling) before the fight with the last red devil.

4) The last armor is collected in level 6 by simply walking right on the first floor with hulk-like monsters on it (the programmers thought you couldn't avoid getting hit by the ogres and so they didn't hide that armor).

Ghouls'n Ghosts (c) 1988 Capcom.


3 years have passed since the events of "Ghosts'n Goblins" and Arthur the knight once again finds himself battling against the hideous creatures of Demon World. The demons have now seized the kingdom and Arthur returns home to witness the castle's lone survivor, his beloved Gunievere, murdered by the king of the demons, Lucifer. Arthur once again embarks on a one-man quest to destroy the demonic invaders and save Gunievere's mortal soul.


Game-play is of a very similar vein to that of "Ghosts'n Goblins" - the classic run, jump and shoot action remains intact. Ghouls'n Ghosts is, however, even more difficult than its already demanding predecessor. Arthur now has access to several new power-ups to aid him on his daunting quest, such as 'Golden Armour' which gives Arthur greater protection from the demons. Additionally, unlike "Ghosts'n Goblins", Arthur can now fire his weapons upwards instead of just left or right and, while jumping, can fire beneath him as well.


The graphics in Ghouls'n Ghosts are predictably far superior to those of its 1985 prequel, with highly imaginative level design and superbly-drawn, smoothly animated enemies all adding to the game's superb Gothic feel.

- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1987.


The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Galactic Chivalry Story'.


This game is a parody of anime, manga, and other bits of Japanese popular culture. The default hi-score table's names are the names of various anime studios (4, 6-8) and manga publications (1, 5).


The list of enemies in attract mode is only partial. 'G. Robo' is Giant Robo, from the 7-part OVA series of the same name. 'Zaku' is from the original TV and movie series Mobile Suit Gundam, and was the Jion's main unit during the One-Year War era. 'Joe' is Joe Yabuki from Tomorrow's Joe, and is in fact the very same Joe from the Neo-Geo game "Legend of Success Joe".


On level 7, the guy with the hat and the bazooka is Jigen Daisuke from Lupin III (see the history entry for "Lupin III" for more info). The kung-fu guy who explodes when you kill him is Ken from Fist of the North Star, consisting of two TV series and one (bad) movie. Ken used a kung-fu technique that involved striking pressure points, causing his enemies to messily explode with a single tap of a finger.


The house that you pass through in level 1 is the apartment from Maison Ikkoku. The guy by the hole in the wall is Yotsuya, who broke the wall so he could more effectively pester his neighbor (the main character, Godai). The woman with the broom in the room next door is Kyoko, the landlady. The clock on the roof doesn't work.


Ginga Ninkyouden was released in Australia as "Galaxy Hero".

A prototype version of this game is known as "Golden Castle". This game is known in Japan as "Ougon no Shiro", and as "Great Gurianos".


Guaranos and Irene appear in Allumer's "Blandia" as the selectable characters Gurianos and Irriana respectively.


Stephan Gore holds the official record for this game with 41,012,800 points.


- UPDATES -


The Japanese version ("Ohgon no Siro") and the prototype ("Golden Castle") have a nudity feature not present in Gladiator. The female warrior Irene is shown with bare breasts when defeated by removing all layers of her chest armor (In Gladiator she still wears a bikini top when defeated this way).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When Gurianos is fully armored, the player may create a momentary protective shield by rapidly moving the joystick up and down. 


* Pick up all 4 flying swords at the beginning of each stage to turn Gurianos' sword RED. If the player is then able to hit an opponent's shield 14 times with his RED SWORD, is armor is momentarily changed to a glowing GOLD color and his opponents can't harm him.


* Break the Magic Crystal Balls to replenish Gurianos' armor.


* Each opposing warrior has his own personality and way of fighting. Irene is vulnerable when she strikes at the player's chest armor. Zenon is most vulnerable when you trick him and make him laugh. Each opponent has his strengths and weaknesses and it's fun and challenging to the player to learn each of them.

Golden Axe (c) 1989 Sega.


A classic sideways scrolling beat-em-up set in a traditional fantasy world, in which between 1 and 3 warriors take up arms to save the King from the evil Death Adder. The 3 different player characters are an Amazonian warrior, a barbarian hero and a viking dwarf. Each hero uses a different kind of magic : the barbarian uses earth magic, the amazon uses fire magic and the viking dwarf uses lightning magic. In addition : each player character also carried a different weapon : the amazonian warrior and the barbarian both use swords while the viking dwarf uses the Golden Axe itself.


Each character in the game has a special attack move that is activated by pressing both JUMP and ATTACK at the same time. Also, double-tapping the joystick right or left will cause the player to charge and smash into opponents. At certain points during the game, players will come across certain creatures (such as dragons) which, once their original riders have been knocked from the saddle, can be mounted and used against the enemy.


At certain points during a level, as well as at the end of each level, drawfs appears carrying a sack on their back. Players can hit the drawfs causing them to drop food and magic potions.


Once the game has been beaten, the ending will show a view of an arcade where the characters 'jump out' of the game, run out of the arcade and down the street.

- TRIVIA -


Released in June 1989.


Uchida originally wanted to make a theme similar to "Dragon Quest", but seeing as how the higher ups at Sega didn't quite see the charm in that, Uchida and his team ended up making Golden Axe, thinking that selectable characters and flashy magic spells would make for a success. The game did end up becoming one of Sega's big franchises early on and spawned multiple sequels.


Note : The kanji on the title screen actually reads 'Senpu', meaning 'Fighting Axe'. This is an example of 'gikun', where Japanese artists use the phonetic value of a character to determine the game's name and not the meaning of the character itself.


Many of the samples used for Golden Axe and its sequel were taken from the movies 'Rambo - First Blood' and 'Conan the Cimmerian'. More specific when you kill bad guys sometimes they scream something like 'Oooh God!' which was taken from Rambo at the scene which takes place in the forest when one of the policemen fell into a trap and gets impaled by sharp pieces of wood. The sample used for the man who gets trampled by a bad guy in Golden Axe and the scream of Death-Adder when falling from the dragon at the final scene of "Golden Axe - Revenge of Death-Adder" was taken from the policeman who also fell from the helicopter pursuiting Rambo. Finally the battle cry used for the big baddies when they die in Golden Axe and the scream for the big chained green monster on "Golden Axe - Revenge of Death-Adder" on stage 3 are the same and taken from Conan's scene where Arnold Schwarzenegger fights the two villains on a Stonehenge like background and again one of them gets impaled by a trap.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Super Sonic Team : G.S.M. SEGA 3 - PCCB-00009) on 21/10/1989.

Wave Master released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Golden Axe The Music - WM-0595~7) on 21/02/2008 containing music from the original arcade and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis series.


Two limited Edition Comic Book Series' to accompany the game were published in the UK in the early 1990's. They can be found along with other Sega related adaptions in fleetways 'Sonic The Comic' which ran for approximately 200 issues.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Two Player Health Restoral : If a player's health is at zero (no life bar visible) when the bonus level/intermission ends, s/he will begin the next level at full health (three life bars). So if you CAREFULLY hack one another, you can restore your health. You should allow the other character to recover after each swipe, otherwise you may throw or kick and actually kill the other player.

Gorf (c) 1981 Midway.


The player's goal is to defeat the Gorfian Empire and safeguard the future of mankind. Gorf is a single screen shoot-em-up in the classic "Space Invaders" mould, the prime difference being that Gorf offers 5 distinct levels of shooting action. The levels are as follows :


* Mission 1, Astro Battles : The first mission is more or less a straight clone of "Space Invaders", set against a sky-blue background. The player is protected by a glittering parabolic forcefield, which is gradually worn away by enemy projectiles. The forcefield also works in BOTH directions and therefore it must momentarily deactivate in order for the player's ship to fire out. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the invaders.


* Mission 2, Laser Attack : The other missions are all set in space. In this mission, the player is faced with 2 formations each made up of 5 enemies. The formations are cross-shaped, and at the bottom of each formation is a single laser gun. The laser guns fire a long, dangerous yellow beam at regular intervals. At the same time, the other enemies may break formation and attempt to divebomb the player. Destroying a laser gun causes the corresponding formation to break apart. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the enemies.


* Mission 3, Galaxians : This mission is a clone of "Galaxian". The player is faced with a swarm of galaxians, which continually divebomb and shower the player with deadly projectiles. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the galaxians.


* Mission 4, Space Warp : A wormhole is situated in the middle of the screen out of which enemies ships emerge - one-at-a-time - and spiral outward at increasing speed; whilst growing larger and flinging fireballs at the player. The Space Warp level would have an influence on Konami's superb "Gyruss", released 2 years' earlier. To advance to the next mission, the player must survive a number of these enemies.


* Mission 5, Flagship : The final mission is a 1-on-1 confrontation with the alien Flag-ship itself. The Flagship is one of the earliest examples of the 'boss' enemy in mainstream video games. It is equipped with its own forcefield, through which the player must blast in order to get a clean shot on the ship. It is also armed with a powerful fireball weapon. The player's weapon has a minor effect on the Flagship's hull, and can only blast off tiny pieces of it. This adds to the player's problems, as stray pieces of hull can destroy their ship. These pieces can be destroyed with a single shot. The only way to destroy the Flagship is to hit the glowing reactor at the heart of the ship, either by first blasting away the hull to expose it, or by managing to fire a shot directly into the tiny vent that leads to the reactor.


Each time the Flagship is destroyed, the player advances in rank. Initially, the player begins with the rank of Space Cadet, before moving on to Space Captain, Space Colonel, Space General, Space Warrior, and finally Space Avenger. The player's spaceship is equipped with a Quark Laser which allows the player to cancel a poorly aimed shot and fire another shot.


- TECHNICAL -


Gorf arcade units came in a blue and grey dedicated cabinet with sticker sideart of several spaceships locked in battle. Cabaret and cocktail versions were also common (the cabaret models had wood grain paneling with no sideart) Play was controlled with a center mounted 'flight yolk' type controller.

- TRIVIA -


Released in February 1981, Gorf was the first game ever to show multiple scenes.


Gorf has achieved the status of 'true status' and became legendary for its groundbreaking, yet almost unintelligible speech.


Note : ever notice that GORF is FROG spelled backwards? Seriously, GORF is an acronym for 'Galactic Orbital Robot Force'.


The game's creator, Jay Fenton, designed a sequel to Gorf called 'Ms. Gorf', but it was never released.


The game's programmer, Jay Fenton, underwent a sex change and is now known as Jamie Fenton.


A Star Trek tie in was originally planned by Midway, but when the first movie fell flat, the Enterprise sprite was reused as the Gorf flagship.


During the attract modes and gameplay, Gorf says a number of humorous things. Some examples are: "Try again, I devour coins!", "Ha ha ha ha!", "Prepare for annihilation!", "All hail the supreme Gorfian Empire!" and the infamous "Long Live Gorf!".


Todd Rogers holds the official record for this game with 653,990 points.


A Gorf unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' and in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.


An upright Gorf unit appears in the 38 Special music video 'Caught Up In You'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* The action starts immediately as soon as you start your game. The first sight that will greet you are the Space Invaders. From that point on, the action will be non-stop with the only things changing are your rank and the difficulty of the enemies. Also, there is an interesting quirk in the game. If your ship hits a displayed score (after destroying some enemy), your ship will be destroyed. So avoid flying into scores. Also, you can only have one shot up at a time. This, though, can be countered by the fact that you can prematurely end a shot and fire another thus saving yourself a lot of time and perhaps your ship.


* Due to Gorf's limited hardware not being powerful enough to move the game's colourful sprites around easily, it's possible, on the Astro Battles screen, to slow the last two invaders down to a crawl; simply by repeatedly firing. On the Laser Attack screen, if you shoot all the enemy ships EXCEPT for the laser shooters, you can sit forever on the far left hand side of the screen. Useless, but interesting all the same.


* Astro Battles :

1) Fire immediately when the mission starts. You may get lucky and hit the Gorfian robot distributing the Space Invaders. Also fire at the invaders as they are being distributed for more points.

2) Instead of the normal 11x5 grid of invaders, you only have to deal with an 8x3 grid.

3) Instead of buildings to protect your ship, you now have a shield dome over you. It briefly disappears when you fire but the invaders have to cut through it with their lasers.

4) Remember, you have a lot of maneuverability in your ship (i.e. you can go up and down) so it should be easy to avoid the invaders bombs.


* Laser Attack :

1) Your first priority should be the laser ships. Wait until they have fired and send a shot right up their laser cannon.

2) The escorts tend to make random movements so be wary of them coming at you from all directions.

3) As the game progresses, everything speeds up accordingly.


* Galaxian :

1) Try to shoot the Galaxians when they are setting up to get the score for attacking Galaxian.

2) At first, only a couple will come down. After a while, though, the Galaxians attempt to swarm all over your ship. Since they each fire 3 shots apiece, this can present a particularly deadly situation.

3) Keep moving. There is no safe place (not even the corners).

4) At later ranks, it isn't uncommon for a whole bunch of Galaxians to attack your ship at once.

5) If you can, try to hit the Gorfian robot that sometimes bounds over the top of the Galaxians.


* Space Warp :

1) This is the mission that tends to kill off most players. You will see a black hole with dots in it. These dots represent the number of fighters you have to deal with coming out of the black hole. As a Space Cadet, you only deal with 12 fighters. After that, it will be 16 fighters.

2) Fighters leave fast or slow and rotate around the hole. In addition, they will also fire at you. It will take some fancy maneuvering to avoid both the fighter and the shot it fired.

3) Some fighters go around so fast, you just have to try to keep out of its way.

4) Sometimes fighters will launch a slow shot from the side of the screen. Watch out for these shots.

5) In the later ranks, it will take all of your skill to survive since everything moves very quickly on this mission.


* Flag Ship :

1) The Flag Ship will fly back and forth slowly. It will descend then ascend as it completes a back and forth movement.

2) There is a shield around the Flag Ship you must cut through to hit it. The Flag Ship can fire through the shield at you.

3) On the later ranks, the Flag Ship is escorted by two Gorfian robots.

4) Plan your shots so you can expose the reactor. This will mean cutting through a little bit of the ship to accomplish this. Watch out for the debris you create since it is as deadly as the Flag Ship's laser shots. If you feel really daring, hit the debris for extra points.

5) After you have stripped the ship away from the reactor, a well-placed shot should obliterate the Flag Ship.

6) Again, in the later ranks everything moves much faster.

Gradius II - GOFER no Yabou (c) 1988 Konami.


The third game in Konami's renowned "Gradius" series; the prequel being "Gradius" (known as "Nemesis" in Europe) and a spinoff called "Salamander" (also known as "Life Force"). Gradius II strictly adheres to the shoot-em-up template set out by its hugely successful predecessor, the game eschews the sideways/vertical scrolling alternate levels of "Salamander" and opts instead for "Gradius" sideways scrolling-only mechanic. This game is rightly considered to be one of the most demanding and difficult shoot-em-ups ever released.

Gradius (c) 1985 Konami.


A superb and demanding shoot'em up that shares - along with Irem's "R-Type" - the destinction of being a true innovator of its genre and, again like R-Type, completely revolutionized the humble shoot-em-up.


Gradius' eye-catching graphics guaranteed gamer interest but it was the game's genius 'weapon upgrade' system that really made the difference. Never before could players actually CHOSE how to upgrade their ship. Destroying waves of enemies would often see the player reward with an 'orb' that could be picked up. The player could collect up to 6 orbs and could effectively 'buy' an upgrade from the 6 displayed at the bottom of the play area (speed-up, bombs, double, laser, multiple - which are orbs that follow the player's movements and add greater firepower - and a mystery 6th upgrade that is marked with an '?'). Game difficulty increases depending on how many power-ups the player has, so it is sometimes advantageous to NOT power-up your ship too much.

Released in May 1985.


This game is known in Europe as "Nemesis".


First shoot-em-up with serious power-ups.


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Vol.1 - 28XA-85) on 27/06/1986.

Apollon Music released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Original Sound of Gradius - KHY1016) on 05/05/1987.


Interesting note : Several Konami arcade games ("Gradius", "Parodius Da! - Shinwa kara Owarai e", "Salamander", etc...) have the default high score set at 57300. '573' refers to Go-Na-Mi kana letters, a play of word for 'Konami'.


Bandai released a boardgame (in Japan only) based on this videogame (same name) in 1986 : The board is split into 8 sections, each with its own rules. The things that remain the same are that each uses a square-grid for movement, and you can power up your ship by getting the capsules.


The first level of Gradius is available as a mini-game in the Nintendo Super NES game "Legend of the Mystical Ninja". 


In the Nintendo NES hockey game Blades of Steel, one of the intermission screens is a playable sequence which recreates the fight against the first Gradius boss.


The popular trading card game 'Yu-Gi-Oh!' has drawn inspiration for some of its cards from the game, which are Gradius, Cyclon Laser, Gradius' Option, Victory Viper XX03, and Power Capsule. Other cards include enemies and boss characters such as Solar Flare Dragon,The Statue of Easter Island, Moai Interceptor Cannons, B.E.S. Covered Core, Big Core, B.E.S. Tetran, and B.E.S. Crystal Core, as well as the spell card Boss Rush.


Konami's music simulation game "Pop'n Music" features the song 'Gradius Full-Speed' which is a mix of the music in the first level of Gradius. This song is also featured in "beatmania IIDX".


There's an unlockable 3-D remake of the original Gradius arcade game found in "Zone of the Enders - The 2nd Runner". It's called Zoradius (for Zone + Gradius). It can be found in the battle against Vic Viper, or by replaying the fight as an Extra mission, then pausing the game an entering a variation of the Konami Code. In Zoradius, the player uses the Vic Viper in fighter mode, flying through a tunnel and shooting down various non-humanoid enemies from the game to gather powerups to increase the Viper's firepower and shields.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Plan your power ups well : When starting/restarting the game, the regular shot being your only method of attack could be very tough. But that doesn't mean increasing your firepower by equipping MULTIPLE very first is good because you cannot move around quickly. You will end up being hit. Therefore, first power up your speed once or twice so you can move faster.


* DOUBLE and its problems : With DOUBLE, you can shoot in front of you and diagonally. However, since you cannot fire rapidly, it is not a weapon easy to use. Equip at least 2 MULTIPLE before equipping DOUBLE.


* Make good use of the LASER : Hitting enemies above and below you with the LASER is rather easy. You don't have to go for a direct hit. Make it fly near the enemy for a slight touch.


* MISSILE movement : The MISSILE moves along the ground. If there is something sticking out of the ground, the MISSILE stops there. Keep an eye on the landscape.


* Take control of the MULTIPLE : The MULTIPLE follow the path of VIC VIPER. Take advantage of this feature and attack enemies that VIC VIPER cannot reach. Use formations to wipe out th enemy!

Also, the faster VIC VIPER is, the more widely spread the MULTIPLE are from each other. Take advantage of this feature as well.


* Renewing the BARRIER : The BARRIER wears out not only by making contact with the enemy and enemy shots. It does so by touching the landscape. Make use of this trait and make the BARRIER touch enemies or the landscape to wear it down and get rid of it. Then equip a new BARRIER.


* Come up with a conquering pattern : This game is a shooter that gives you a lot of freedom in terms of how you can conquer levels. Learn the tips, remember the appearance patterns of the enemy, and come up with your own way of conquering the game.

Gravitar (c) 1982 Atari.


Gravitar is a 1- or 2-player game with a color X-Y video display. This new display, with its 3 color guns and higher voltage, has the same technology that was used in previous Atari black-and-white X-Y displays. However, the screen now displays dazzling colors and unique visual effects.


The player controls a space ship in 3 different solar systems. Each solar system consists of a home base, a death star, a red alien planet and four regular planets. Each planet has its own unique terrain.


The red alien planet is the home of shooting alien ships. Some of the regular planets may have flying alien rammers to be avoided or shot down. The four planets all have fuel cells to be retrieved with a tractor beam and alien bunkers that fire shells. Successfully destroying all of the bunkers results in a MISSION COMPLETE message at the top of the screen. Achieving MISSION COMPLETE allows the player to collect bonus if he can evade the rammers when leaving the planet. If successful, he will be placed back in the solar system.


A player has 2 ways to advance to the next solar system. The first is to successfully complete a mission on all four regular planets. The second way is to complete a mission on the red alien planet, which establishes a link into the next solar system.


The play mode begins in the first solar system with the player's blue ship in the center of the screen at home base. There are four regular planets plus a fifth red alien planet and a death star arranged clockwise around the screen in increasing order of difficulty. The planets are worth 2,000, 4,000, 6,000, and 8,000 points with a value of 9,000 points on the alien planet. The positions of the alien planet and the death star vary in the second and third solar systems. After the first solar system all planets are valued at 9,000 points. The death star, located near home base, is the center of gravity in each solar system. Colliding with it results in the loss of one life, and the player returns to home base.


The words SCORE (with current total score), FUEL (running total of original 10,000-point fuel supply), and BONUS (decreasing point value of planet under attack) appear at the top of the screen throughout game play.


Player controls consist of LEFT ROTATE, RIGHT ROTATE, FIRE, THRUST, and TRACTOR/SHIELD yellow pushbuttons. Use FIRE to shoot targets. A player has four shells that must hit a target or must travel their full distance in order to be reloaded. TRACTOR/SHIELD retrieves fuel with a tractor beam and shields the ship from alien shots. The TRACTOR/SHIELD does not prevent the ship from crashing into land or alien ships. TRACTOR/SHIELD and THRUST decrease the player's fuel supply. Using these controls together decreases the fuel supply even faster.


Blue fuel cells are positioned just below a planet's surface. There are two, three, or four fuel cells per planet terrain (depending on level of game play). Each cell beamed aboard ship with TRACTOR is worth 2,500 fuel units.


If the player's ship is above the highest point on some planet terrains, flying alien rammers attack him. Shooting a rammer scores 100 points.


If the player gets too close to a shooting alien ship, he is involved in a one-on-one space dogfight, and either he or the alien ship must die. If the player is victorious, he returns to the solar system at his original spot; if the alien ship wins, the player loses a life and returns to home base.


Red alien bunkers appear on each planet. There are 2, 4, 6, or 8 bunkers per surface (depending on the difficulty of the planet). The bunkers fire shots to protect the fuel cells. Exploding a bunker scores 250 points. Exploding all bunkers in a solar system displays a MISSION COMPLETE message.


The word SUPERBONUS and the number of superbonus points appear in the middle of the screen only after a completed mission on the first planet in the first solar system. These superbonus points are awarded on the basis of initial difficulty of the first planet successfully completed. The higher the bonus point value of the planet attacked, the higher the superbonus awarded. No superbonus points are awarded for attacking the 2,000-point (easiest) planet or for attacking the four regular planets in consecutive order of difficulty.


A player may fly to any planet he chooses. The number beside each planet is the starting number of bonus points for that planet. Entering a planet causes the distinct planet terrain to appear. To get maximum points, the player must shoot all alien bunkers and see MISSION COMPLETE at the top of the screen. A player may exit a planet at any time; he does not have to stay any longer than he wishes.


The red alien planet (worth 9,000 points) is home for red alien ships that must be shot down or avoided. The alien planet looks the same in every solar system: terrain consists of a spiral tunnel with a reactor at its end. Under a decrementing timer, the player must maneuver through the tunnel without hitting the walls and shoot the reactor (Hitting the walls or not escaping in time places the player back at home base). Shooting the reactor will make it glow and pulsate. Then the player must escape before the timer reaches zero (In the next solar systems, the timer of the alien planet decreases by two seconds, and there are shooting bunkers to overcome). Completing the mission on the alien planet places the player in the next solar system with an additional 7,500 fuel points.


Gravitar progresses by waves of planets (new solar systems). Successfully destroying the reactor and escaping from the red alien planet, or achieving a MISSION COMPLETE on all four regular planets places the player in the next solar system (next level of game play). The 4 levels of game play are described as follows :


a. Regular gravity

b. Negative gravity

c. Regular gravity with invisible landscape and maximum difficulty

d. Negative gravity with invisible landscape and maximum difficulty


Alien ship speed and firing frequency, rammer speed, bunker firing frequency, and bonus points are all based on time elapsed in game play. Both regular and negative gravity increase, depending on the initial planet bonus level.


The game ends when all lives are used up or when player is out of fuel.

- TRIVIA -


Released in August 1982. 5,427 units were produced and original sale price was $2,095.


Developed in 14 months, Gravitar was the first game that Mike Hally produced and designed for Atari. The concept of Gravitar was based on a combination of "Lunar Lander" and "Asteroids".


Gravitar has a color X-Y video display. This display, with its 3 color guns and higher voltage, has the same technology that was used in previous Atari black-and-white X-Y displays. However, the screen now displays dazzling colors and unique visual effects.


Gravitar was the first game to have a real-time dynamic perspective - When you enter a planet, the screen zooms in to give you a closer look. Unfortunately, it was a colossal failure, primarily because of its difficulty. While beautiful to look at for its time, the learning curve was too steep too early - When you're plugging quarters into a machine, you stop playing a tough game. But interest in the title has resurged among hard-core arcade gamers. This is because once the controls are mastered, the game is phenomenally addictive.


The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including GRAVITAR.


Dan Coogan, of Phoenix, AZ set a new Gravitar world record, scoring 8,029,450 points on 12/23/2006, playing for 23 hours and 15 minutes. The previous world record was 4,722,200, which reigned for 24 years, set by Ray Mueller of Boulder, CO on 12/4/1982, playing for 12 hours and 21 minutes.


A Gravitar unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1983 movie 'James Bond 007 - Never Say Never Again' and in the 1987 movie 'Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown'.


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", Gravitar, "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".


The prototype of this game is known as "Lunar Battle".


- SCORING -


Obstacles :

Red bunker : 250 points

Rammer : 100 points

Alien Ship : 100 points


Each planet has a bonus that constantly decreases with elapsed game time.

A superbonus is awarded after the first MISSION COMPLETE is achieved.

Planet Bonus 9,000 - Superbonus 20,000

Planet Bonus 8,000 - Superbonus 12,000

Planet Bonus 6,000 - Superbonus 6,000

Planet Bonus 4,000 - Superbonus 2,000

Planet Bonus 2,000 - Superbonus 0


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Depending on the highest score, 1 of 8 list names appears above the table of initials...

Between 0 and 20,000 points : FLUNKY

Between 20,001 and 40,000 points : GUNNER

Between 40,001 and 80,000 points : CO-PILOT

Between 80,001 and 100,000 points : PILOT

Between 100,001 and 200,000 points : ACE PILOT

Between 201,001 and 400,000 points : KILLER PILOT

Between 400,001 and 800,000 points : PONTIUS PILATE

Above 800,000 points : GOTTA-BE-LUCKY


* A Well Known Cheat/Bug : At a joint between 2 vectors (>90 degrees), position yourself below and shoot straight up. If you can align yourself just right, the shots will travel through the walls at the joint. Without moving from side to side, just thrust up and voila, you are now inside the wall. You can now move around and shoot the gun pods from behind. This is especially useful if you can get under the world!


* Hint 1 : Develop skill for controlling the space ship in regular and negative gravity.


* Hint 2 : Beam up fuel cells with TRACTOR/SHIELD.


* Hint 3 : Attack the red alien planet first for maximum challenge and 20,000 bonus points! Completion of this planet immediately places a player in the next solar system where all planets are worth 9,000 bonus points.


* Hint 4 : Attack more difficult planets early in the game for higher bonus points.


* Hint 5 : Many planet terrains have safe areas or 'blind spots' from which the player can safely shoot at bunkers.

There are a total of 3 stages in Great Swordsman, with a total of 15 opponents. Once you finish the last opponent, the game starts over from the beginning at a much harder skill level (you keep your points, however). Between each stage, there's a bonus stage that allows you to rack up points by blocking an archer's arrows. Following are the stage and opponent names :


* Stage 1 - Fencing

Opponent 1 : Appels

Opponent 2 : Redon

Opponent 3 : Fantin

  

* Bonus Stage 1 - Block the Archer's Arrows

   

* Stage 2 - Kendo

Opponent 1 : Senpou  

Opponent 2 : Jihou   

Opponent 3 : Chuken  

Opponent 4 : Fukusho 

Opponent 5 : Taisho


* Bonus Stage 2 - Block the Archer's Arrows


* Stage 3 - Roman

Opponent 1 : Mars

Opponent 2 : Hermes

Opponent 3 : Apollo

Opponent 4 : Helios

Opponent 5 : Orion

Opponent 6 : Uranus

Opponent 7 : Zeus


The names of the opponents in this game are interesting in that each stage's names are terms/names used either in that art form, country of origin, or era in which the art form was related to. Following are reasons (and perhaps guesses) as to why they used the names they did :


Appels - A quick stamp of the foot used in fencing as a feint to produce an opening.

Redon - Redon, Odilon (1840-1916). French painter and graphic artist, one of the outstanding figures of Symbolism.

Fantin - Fantin-Latour, Henri (1836-1904). French painter and lithographer.


Senpou - The first 'player' in a Kenpo match-style competition to line up (also spelled "Senpo").

Jihou - The second 'player' in a Kenpo match-style competition to line up (also spelled "Jiho").

Chuken - The third 'player' in a Kenpo match-style competition to line up.

Fukusho - The fourth 'player' in a Kenpo match-style competition to line up.

Taisho - The last 'player' in a Kenpo match-style competition to line up.


Mars - God of war

Hermes - God of boundaries and of the travelers who cross them (such as bringing newly-dead souls to the underworld, Hades)

Apollo - God of music, archery, healing, light, truth, etc... 

Helios - God of the Sun

Orion - God, the hunter

Uranus - God of the Sky

Zeus - God of the Earth and Ruler of Mount Olympus


On stages 1 and 2, any 2 out-of-bounds results in a loss of a point. It is impossible to go out-of-bounds on stage 3. Stage 1 requires 5 points per match, with 3 matches. Stage 2 requires 2 points per match, with 5 matches. Stage 3 requires 1 point per match with 7 matches. Simultaneous hits do not count for either player. On Stage 1, a tie results in a win for you! (It is impossible to tie on stages 2 and 3, based on their point structures).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Trick : By continually hitting your opponents sword, you can cause them to lose their sword. Their sword ends up impaling their head!


* Trick : Killing your opponent very quickly with a strike to the head can cause their helmet to fly off.


* Tip : High and mid strikes in succession can easily force your opponent out-of-bounds.


* Tip : On stage 1, holding away from your opponent while striking increases your weapon return speed.


* Tip : On stage 3, use the far right wall as a defense, since you can't step out-of-bounds.

Gryzor (c) 1987 Konami.


In 2631, a meteorite strikes the Galuga archipelago near New Zealand, carrying with it a dormant alien lifeform. Two years later in 2633, a terrorist organization of alien origin called Red Falcon takes over the island as part of their plot to invade the Earth. Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, of the Contra unit, are sent to the Oceania island to stop the evil threat.


Gryzor is a hectic 1 or 2-player platform shoot-em-up featuring five stages. Three of the levels are standard side-scrolling platform levels, while the remaining 2 are enemy 'bases'; 3rd person into-the-screen stages in which players must run down series of heavily defended corridors to reach and destroy an end-of-level boss, before moving onto the next stage.


Each player's character is equipped with a semi-automatic machine gun with an unlimited amount of ammunition and can jump, move and fire in all eight cardinal directions. Players can also move and jump simultaneously while firing. Co-ordination of the character's movement is essential as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player's character and also eliminate the current weapon from the player's inventory.


As players fight their way through the enemy-packed levels, additional weapons can be collected. If the player loses a life, they will also lose any weapon power-up they were carrying. Available weapons are :

* Machine gun [M] : Auto-fire.

* Spread gun [S] : Allows the player to fire five shots in an arc.

* Laser gun [L] : Will shoot a long laser that can take out many enemies in a row.

* Fire Ball [F] : A gun which fires small fireballs in a corkscrew pattern.

* Rapid-fire [R] : Increases the firing rate of the player's currently equipped weapon.

* Barrier [B] : Will make the player invincible for a few seconds.


The game's 5 levels and bosses are as follows :

Stage 1 : Jungle - Defensive Wall ' (horizontal scrolling)

Stage 2 : Base 01 - Six turrets and alien eyeball - (3rd-person)

Stage 3 : Waterfall - Large Alien - (vertical scrolling)

Stage 4 : Base 02 - Six turrets and alien head - (3rd-person)

Stage 5 : Snow Field/Energy Zone/Hangar/Alien Lair - Alien Heart - (horizontal scrolling)

Chad Johnson holds the official record for this game with 1, 546, 600 points on July 15, 2002. 


Alpha Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Vol.4 - 28XA-201) on 10/03/1988.


- UPDATES -


Gryzor is the European version of the game known as "Contra" in North America and Japan. The Gryzor version differs from the other regional releases as the 2-players mode can only play alternating, rather than simultaneously.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Use shots wisely : Jump shots and crouch shots allow you to attack while avoiding enemy attacks. Do not hesitate. Keep those shots going!


* Kill before being killed : if you see an enemy, shoot right away. Defeat them before they fire at you. Be the first one to attack!


* Tip for taking down the fortress : Fortresses situated at the end of eah levl have a weak point (sensor). Concentrate your attack on the weak point!

But Destroy the cannons first. Cannons will remain even if you take out the sensor first and the fortress morphs.


* Tip for 3-D levels : Destroy the weak points of each floor and stop the high voltage electric currents. Taking out the weak points quickly is key to conquerins the 3-D levels.

If you press UP on the control pad and touch th electricity, you will be stunned and won't be able to mov for a while. Don't move forward until you take out the weak point and stop the electricity.

After you take out the weak point, look at the map while proceeding. You'll know whether to go left or right.

You can dodge enemy bullets by lying down! Destroy rolling mines by using crouch shots.

As you proceed, there are weak points that are positioned so that you can't reach them. Utilize jump shots and crouch shots.


* Beware of Falling off at Stage 4 : In Stage 4 where you climb up a waterfall, missing a platform and falling down will count as a miss.


* Barrier : At specfic spots in Stages 4 & 9, you can pick up barriers that make you invincible for a while. However, there is a rule : 'A barrier will appear only when you are NOT equipped with a special weapong'.

Guerrilla War (c) 1988 SNK.


The country is struggling against the cruel domination of the King. The rebel guerrilla leader and his comrades attempt to secretly land on shore. The King's military is waiting for them, however, and the players must fight their way inland to reach and attack the enemy fortress.


In this, the pseudo-sequel to SNK's own superb "Ikari Warriors" (released 2 years earlier), players must once again shoot their way through a number of vertically scrolling levels, all packed with hoards of enemy soldiers, gun emplacements and vehicles. Each level also contains a number of captured prisoners tied to wooden stakes, and these can be rescued for extra points.


The players' munitions are deletable, and additional ammo/grenades must be picked up along the way; a number of gun upgrades can also be found. At various points in the game, players can also enter un-occupied enemy tanks, which provide increased firepower as well as resistance to enemy shots. Too many enemy hits, however, will eventually see the tank explode - this is proceeded by a warning flash to allow the player to leave the tank before the explosion takes place. Should the player be caught inside or near the tank when it explodes, a life is lost.


As with "Ikari Warriors", Guerrilla War features full 360 degree gameplay with attacking troops appearing from all directions. The players' on-screen counterparts are able to rotate themselves accordingly.

Released in January 1991.


This game is known in Japan as "Gun Frontier".


This game was inspired from the Anime series of the same name by Leiji Matsumoto. It is a hilarious, thrilling and outrageous story that takes place on a lawless planet in deep space. In a wild land where the dust of sand swirls, two totally different men, Harlock 'the Quick Draw' and Tochiro 'the Master Swordsman,' meet a mysterious woman called Sinunora and travel together. "This odd threesome gets involved in thrilling and outrageous brawls and seems to attract one fight after another!".


S. Yagawa paid homage to this game by programming "Battle Garegga", which has a lot of features taken from "Gun Frontier" (not only design, you can destroy scenery, weapon and bombs system, etc).


Leiji Matsumoto, in his series 'Cosmo Warrior Zero', recycles the "Gun Frontier" settings for the 'Silvana' character. Since the Sony PlayStation tie-in was produced by Taito, the planet looks like planet "Gloria", the one featured in this Taito shmup.

Gun Fight [Upright model] (c) 1975 Midway.


Each player (2 people play at a time--there is no computer opponent) controls a gunfighter. Your left hand has a 4-way joystick which moves your gunfighter anywhere on your side of the screen. Your right hand has a gun grip which tilts up and down to aim your gunfighter's pistol and which has a trigger to fire. Your only goal is to shoot the other player, who is right across the screen from you; he will then fall down and say 'Got Me'. It isn't usually a straight shot, as there will always be cactuses, a moving stagecoach, or trees somewhere between the 2 players. (Another obstacle will be added for each hit scored.) Just shoot the other player for points. The game is time based, and not life based. The factory setting is for a 90-second game, but this is operator-adjustable down to as low as 60 seconds.


- TECHNICAL -


This Upright model was mostly red, but it was covered with painted cowboy side-art. There was no marquee at all, the game had its title printed on the monitor bezel, down towards the control panel. The machine overall had an attractive look.

Released in November 1975.


Also released as "Gun Fight [Cocktail Table model]".


Gun Fight was based on Taito's Western Gun, a game which used TTL-based discrete logic hardware.  Midway's Dave Nutting adapted the Taito game to use an Intel 8080 microprocessor. Gun Fight was the first Japanese title to be licensed for release in America. It was also the first video game to incorporate a microprocessor, and the expanded processing capabilities allowed for graphics and game-play much more advanced than "Pong".


Gun Fight was a pretty important video-games innovator. It was the first game ever to have 2 on-screen humans battling against each other at the same time, and as such it's the grandfather of the fighting games that take up most of the floorspace in modern arcades. It also introduced the idea of having separate controls for aiming and moving.


A Gun Fight unit appears in the 1978 movie 'Dawn of the Dead'.

A vertically scrolling shoot-em-up set in the Wild West, in which the player takes the role of a Billy; a young Sheriff charged with hunting down and killing a number of infamous 'Wanted' outlaws.


Each level is packed with gun-toting bandits and the Sheriff must shoot his way through the stage, before finally taking on the wanted outlaw 'boss' character at the end. Each outlaw wields a special weapon unique to them, such as a Winchester rifle, knives, darts or boomerangs.


Shooting the barrels that litter the levels reveals power-ups such as boots (for extra speed), rifles (for increased range) and bullets (for rapid fire). The game's 3 directional fire buttons (for firing left, right or ahead) can be combined (pressed Simultaneously) to create a total of 8 different firing directions.

Roy raises from the dead as a sort of indestructible zombie. You can shoot him as much as you like, but he won't die. In this way you can play until you get tired of it.

This game is very unique in that it depicts the hero of the story as a drunkard who's the shame of the family (look at some of the cut scenes) yet is able to put out fires (by puking? no less). It wasn't until the early 1990's when the fighting games would include a fighter who drinks as part of his repertoire.

- SCORING -


1 Fireball : 200 points

2 Fireballs : 400 points

Bonus at end of round.


Above scores double when 'GUZZLER' letters on bottom are lit. See 'Tips and Tricks' for how to do this.


There's also 10 points given for every few seconds survived.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


If you want to double your scores at the end of the round (and your bonus as well) be sure to light the 'GUZZLER' letters on the bottom of the screen. The way you do this is to hit one of the fireballs (or a fire that becomes like a fireball) in each row when the letter is highlighted (red border around the letter).

Gyruss (c) 1983 Konami.


A single player shoot-em-up in which the purpose is to fly through the solar system, destroying waves of alien attackers, before finally reaching Earth. Planets that must be passed before Earth is reached are Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars.


It only takes two warps to reach Neptune, but all of the others, including Earth, take three warps to get to. Each time the player reaches a planet, they will be faced with a Challenge Stage. A bonus stage in which players try to destroy as many aliens as possible to accrue points. After reaching Earth, there is a Challenge Stage, followed by a very fast 'three warps to Neptune' stage. After this, the levels and the background music start over.


Gyruss' superb gameplay, in which the player ship rotates around the edges of the screen and fires 'inwards', is heavily influenced by Atari's 1981 classic, "Tempest". While the design of the Alien ships themselves is similar to those of Namco's also legendary "Galaga" series.

Released in March 1983.

Also licensed to Centuri for US manufacture and distribution (April 1983).


After working on the successful "Time Pilot", Gyruss' designer, Yoshiki Okamoto, went on to create "Gyruss", which, although a success in its own right, was released at a time when the arcade craze was starting to die down. This may explain why the game didn't shift the units it really deserved. After its release, Okamoto asked for a raise, or he would quit. He was duly fired when he turned up for work the following day.


One of the most memorable features of this game is its soundtrack, which consists of an extremely catchy synthesized rendition of Bach's 'Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor'.


Anthony Fodrizio holds the official record for this game with 41,090,450 points.


A bootleg of this game is known as "Venus".


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Vol.1 - 28XA-85) on 25/06/1986.


- SCORING -


Shooting a ship : 50, 100 or 150 points.

Destroying a whole formation of enemy ships before the next wave attacks : 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 2,500 points.

Bonus for clearing a sector (having not destroyed a whole formation) : 1,000 points.

Shooting the three glowing spheres : 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 points.

Bonus for shooting each ship on the chance stage : 100 points.

Bonus for shooting all 40 ships on the chance stage : 10,000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* You can get double fire if you shoot the sun-like enemy that appears in front of you surrounded by two blue pod-like enemies - try to make this a priority.


* To make getting double fire easier, try to stay at the bottom of the screen until the 'pod and sun' formation appears as it will appear right in front of wherever your ship is after all enemies have entered and they start attacking. 

1) There must be at least three enemies left in the level for the 'pod and sun' formation to show. If you lose a life and three enemies are left, the 'pod and sun' will show up one more time, but if you lose a life after, they will not show anymore until the next level. After you get double fire, the sun enemy will be replaced on later levels with another pod. Destroy all three for some bonus points.

2) If you have only one enemy left and cannot seem to destroy it, just leave it alone and eventually it will just leave and the level will end.


* Each level begins with four formations entering. If you destroy enough of these, a fifth formation will enter. As you pass each planet, more formations will enter towards the top of the screen. Learn to control your ship at the top as it will come in real handy on those Mars and Earth warps.


* When formations enter from the edge of the screen, they will not hit you if you are right where they enter. You can use this to your advantage to take out the formation with little or no trouble - just watch out for asteroids.


* Asteroids will always appear in your path - they cannot be destroyed and must be avoided.


* The 'bee-like' creatures with the force field will always appear from the center and move outward. The force field will destroy your ship if you touch it. Destroy one of the creatures to disable their force field.


* Learn the formations of the enemy attack waves during the normal stages, to enable you to collect the bonuses for destroying whole waves of attacking ships.


* Learn the formations of the enemy attack waves during the chance stages, to enable you to collect the bonuses for destroying whole waves of attackers and the 10,000 for destroying all 40 ships.


* The three glowing spheres always appear aligned with where you are located on screen. Remember to avoid any bullets when they appear.


* You can fire bullets ahead of enemy ships and then move aside to destroy them and avoid their shots.

Released in July 1985.


The first in a series of classic racing games designed by the legendary Yu Suzuki and his team (who would go on to create, among others, the "Out Run" series, as well as this game's sequel, "Super Hang-On"). First simulation game in the world. After this game was released, the standard for motorcycle games is the riding type kind. This game was the first Sega game to use digitized drums in the music.


There are 2 cabinet versions : This Site-Down model and a "Hang-On [Ride-On model]", which was a large, mock-up motorcycle that the player sat on. The Site-Down model featured a motorcycle handlebar, throttle and break lever. The cabinet also has a simulated tachometer and speedometer. The Ride-On version lets you steer your bike by moving your weight left and right, but didn't feature any of the hydraulics or force feedback that would become the staple of future Sega arcade games.

Now your rivals will be much harder and even connect specialty punches they didn't originally have. Also, you'll be able to string 20-hit combos on some opponents. Beat this game mode and you'll be awarded $20,000,000 instead of 10 (Note : This code appears briefly on screen after beating the game in Regular mode).


* Unlock A Powerful World : Begin a normal game. Then, at the opening blue screen, press Right, Up, Left(x2), Down, Up, Right, Down. If done correctly, a bell will sound. Now knockdowns will occur whenever a punch is landed (like sans power in Mortal Kombat). Beat this game mode and you'll be awarded $20,000,000 instead of 10 (Note : This code appears briefly on screen after beating the game in Secret World mode).


* Alien Ball In Power Training Session : Go to the Power Training Session and hit all 50 volleyballs. Then, an alien-like ball with veins and teeth will be thrown at your head. If you miss, it will bite your face, but if you hit it, you'll receive an additional 10% increment, for a grand total of a 30% power increment.


* Moai Mask : Sometimes the referee will be wearing a mask of Moai, the stone head from Parodius and Cue Brick. I haven't confirmed what triggers this particular trick, but I think it could have something to do with the timer. -Maybe winning at 2 :22, 1 :11, or something like that-


* Alternate Credits Roll : Beat the game in New or Powerful World mode. When the credits roll, the names will remain the same but the titles will be different. 'Making of this game' is replaced by 'Staff of Conjax Pro'. Also, keep an eye out for a cameo by Pentarou the penguin from Parodius during either credits roll.


* The Mob Never Forgives : When you win the game and get the park scene, look carefully in the background to spot two hit men armed with UZIs and gunning down a poor guy. The girl next to him tries to run. Is this subliminal violence??

Hatris (c) 1990 Video System.


Hatris is a Tetris-type game where instead of blocks descending, there are hats; top hats, wizard hats, beanines and the like. The game is played by making vertical stacks of hats. When a stack of five hats of the same type and color is created, it disappears. The challenge of the game is that different styles of hats will stack differently. The game ends when one of your stacks of hats reaches the top of the screen. Occasionally, a red or a blue flame will appear. One burns just the top type of hat on a stack. The other will burn a stack to the ground.

Released in February 1988.


This game is known in Japan as "Akumajou Dracula".


Haunted Castle IS part of the "CastleVania" series. However, as many games of this series, it is not part of the main storyline. The main character doesn't have any name, but it is believed to be Simon Belmont of the original "CastleVania".


King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Collection Vol.1 - K30X7705) on 05/08/1988. This album was reprinted (KCIA-2309) on 21/05/1993.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Combinding Credits : If you've ever played Haunted Castle, then you know that you are only allowed 3 continues throughout the game. And since you only get One Life per credit, it makes for a hard game. But if you have four credits in the game and hit the player one start button four times you will combined all four credits together giving you a huge life bar. Making this game a lot easier to play. Only trouble is, if you die, it will be game over because you will have used up all 3 of your continues making your Life Bar bigger.

Head On (c) 1979 Sega.


Head On is a 2-Dimensional maze racing game. You control your car through the maze to pick up the dots while at the same time avoiding the car, or cars, that are constantly trying to ram you. Successfully get through one maze and many more await you. This is good practice for freeway driving in the big city.

- TRIVIA -


Released during April 1979. Head On was another in a short line of arcade games made by the partnership of Sega and Gremlin. Although Gremlin eventually went out of business, Sega continued to produce arcade games. Other notable games produced by this partnership include "Deep Scan", "Astro Blaster", and "Frogger". The game Head On is reputed to be the first game in which the player must eat all of the dots in order to progress to the next level (One year before "Pac-Man", Head On was the first 'eat-the-dots'-style game). The game itself didn't do that great but it did help establish Sega as an arcade machine maker. Other games that came out didn't really allow this game to go far. "Asteroids" and "Space Invaders", to name a couple, were still the big money makers.


Chris Ayra holds the official record for this game with 300,000 points.


A bootleg was made by Sidam under the same name.

A bootleg of this game is known as "Super Crash".


- SCORING -


Dots : 5 points. There are 140 dots per maze to clear giving you 700 points per maze.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your car will be located in the open space in the middle of the bottom of the screen in lane one. The jam car will be located in the middle left of the screen in lane one. On the higher levels, they will progress through lanes one, two, and/or three. As you progress through the levels, the number or speed of the jam cars increases. Here is the breakdown :

Level 1 : One Slow Jam Car

Level 2 : One Fast Jam Car

Level 3 : Two Slow Jam Cars

Level 4 : Two Fast Jam Cars

Level 5 : Three Slow Jam Cars

Level 6 and beyond : Three Fast Jam Cars


* Always be aware of where the Jam Car(s) is/are located. They can only make one lane change at a time but that lane change may be into your lane.


* The faster you go, the fewer lanes you can cross. At full acceleration, you will only be able to change one lane at a time. In the earlier levels, this will be fine since you will only be dealing with one car. In the multiple Jam Car levels, this can be a very bad thing. Decelerate (take your finger off the accelerate button) to go across multiple lanes.


* The Jam Car(s) always travel in a clockwise motion while you travel in a counterclockwise motion. Remember that so that you don't get confused when there are multiple cars in the maze.  Also, the color of the Jam Car is red while yours is white.


* Don't try to get all the dots on one of the lanes. You need to anticipate where your next move is well before you enter the lane change area since you cannot change lanes at any other time.  Sometimes, on the earlier levels, it is best to do a staggered type dot pickup where you do lane one, change to lane two, to lane three, lane four, lane five, then back to lane one. If you time it right, the Jam Car or Cars will still be in the maze.


* Don't let the speed of the Jam Car(s) throw you. Just plan to be out of your lane and in the lane change area before them. If both cars enter at the same time, you run a big risk of a collision.


* Since the game isn't timed, take your time planning on how you will take care of the dots. Don't take chances since you will have to restart the level if your car gets destroyed.

Heavy Barrel (c) 1987 Data East.


The impossibly unthinkable has happened, an army of terrorists have seized a nuclear missile facility. Fortunately for you, they're unaware about a top secret weapon called Heavy Barrel. Why you ask? Because before the facility's security was breached, the inventor of the Heavy Barrel dismantled the only prototype into 6 pieces and stored the pieces into various storage boxes. The only thing that will determine the fate of the world is not by brute force, but with strategy and resourcefulness to stop the terrorist army because this mission is not for just anyone, that's why it's up to you (and an optional friend).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Here's a complete Heavy Barrel  strategy guide : The objective is to wipe out a military complex filled with soldiers and lethal military equipment. The available weapons are the standard machine gun, the heavy machine gun, the fan gun, the flame thrower, and the Heavy Barrel. Grenade weapons include standard grenades, red grenades, and ball and chains.


The Heavy Barrel is a super weapon that you obtain after getting six special pieces that glow yellow when you unlock boxes with keys. It has unlimited ammunition, unlike other guns, but it has a time limit. It destroys everything you hit with it.


Throughout the game there are only enough pieces to get the gun three times, but if you do this you will have to face a very tough section without it. The final machine is nearly impossible to destroy without the Heavy Barrel, so you ought to save parts until you have five, then get the last box that contains a special part.


At the start, you will parachute in. Massacre a bunch of guys until you encounter a man with a tripod machine gun. Kill him, then get the heavy machine gun weapon. Use this to wipe out the small tank next to the bridge.


Four boxes to the left of the bridge will be there. A heavy barrel part is in the second box from the right. Pick up the flame-thrower, and start whaling on the guards and flying packs that come from across the bridge. After they're dead, a chopper will fly in and attempt to kill you. Throw grenades at it, don't waste the flame-thrower. Presuming you have sufficient dodge skill, you can kill the chopper before it overwhelms you with bullets.


Across the bridge, a huge number of guys will attack you. Here is where the flame-thrower is useful--it takes out a lot of guys at once. Next to the pyramid machine gun are three boxes--kill the gun, then open up the leftmost box. That reveals a red grenade icon. Pick that up, and start grenading your way to the gate.


At the gate, grenade everyone to death (you have 70 grenades to start with!) and keep pushing forward.


At three points in the game you will be on a moving platform. In anticipation of these difficult points you  should have red grenades and fan guns or a flame-thrower. If guys jump on the platform you ought to grenade them, since the gun should always be saved for blowing away heavy machinery. The first platform is a series of cannons which can be destroyed with a single grenade, then a series of guards which can be destroyed if you throw a red grenade to the exact center of the screen. At the end is a machine with large grabbers that extend towards you. Stay on the left of the platform, and start flaming it and hurling grenades simultaneously. The machine rarely grabs on the left, so with luck you should be able to destroy it without a loss.


The second platform passes by a million cannons (exaggerated only slightly) and it is imperative that you destroy as many as possible as soon as possible, since they FOLLOW the platform and shoot large cannonballs at you. Here is where dodging is useful, since it's hard to keep the number of cannonballs on the screen below 20.


The third platform consists of a series of flying guards that seem ok, until TWO of the mechanical grabber things show up! Fortunately one attacks first, on the right, so you should stay on the left and disable it ASAP, then switch right and disable the other.


There is, at some point in the game, a narrow bridge which is the killing zone for two helicopters. You should have good weapons, and run up while facing backwards. Hopefully you can flame a copter to death, after which you can dodge the other until you kill it. If you die, pick up the fan gun sitting on the bridge, and use it.


At another point you will be confronted with two conveyor belts (which you cannot ride) going in opposite directions. Due to the obstructions in the middle you ought to use the Heavy Barrel here to blow everyone away, and run through like crazy.


At another point you will have to run a gauntlet of cannons and grenade- throwing guards. To deal with this, DON'T use the HB, since you will not be able to get enough parts to kill the last guy. You should get a flame-thrower, and fire left even before the enemies show up on the screen. They will die, and you can walk left to get more weapons as they show up.


Another large machine spits out glowing needles that split into three parts and angle downwards. You should dodge left and right methodically while tossing grenades and firing. Don't look at the machine! Just keep doing that while looking at the needles and dodging. Lives are much more important than keeping a hoard of weapons.


At one point you will meet three Predator-like creatures. You can destroy these three using machine gun or simple grenades, though they look tough! Only one or two fire slow shots at a time, so you can dodge them. Keep pumping bullets into them until one explodes.


The final gauntlet is hell. Enemy guards throw red grenades right and left, copters keep charging you, and more predators show up. You should keep moving forward, never getting stuck in position, since if you press on you ought to be able to get the grenade throwers before they let off one throw. Keep your ammo well stocked by picking up new guns, even if you still have 20 shots left. Red grenades are essential here--the ball and chain is too slow to deal with so many guys.


You are near the end when you drive off the laughing guy... pick up the next box on the left, get the Heavy Barrel, walk north, and finish the game.


A few obvious reminders--you can only carry four keys, so if you have four and more are lying around, open up boxes. They can contain extra lives, shields, red grenades, weapons, a cloud gun (which is virtually useless), and HB parts. Learning where the HB parts are is pretty important too. But most essential is learning when to conserve your ammo and when to cut loose with everything you have.


The high score is essentially meaningless, since at the end you have about 400k points and you get 1 million for killing the last guy.

Players can also start fights with one another to really spice things up.

It was 1987 and SunA had just released a hot new "Arkanoid" clone named "Goindol". It was a ball and paddle game with a prehistoric theme. Soon after the first "Goindol" unit shipped, pirate game manufacturer ALSFTW decided that they were going to make a bootleg version of the game to sell to the rich American and European market. Now the first thing you do when creating a bootleg game is to change the name, and set up a front company. So they saw the little caveman that was on all the game screens, and decided to name their game 'Homo,' and their front company 'Homo Sapiens'. All these decisions were made by people with little experience with the english language, so they had little idea that Homo also meant 'A rude abbreviation for homosexual. Used more often by children than by adults'. 


They went ahead and created thousands of 'Homo conversion kits', and then tried to sell them to the english speaking market. Bootleg conversion kits usually sell fast, because they are priced so much cheaper than the games they copy. But, they had a hard time selling their 'Homo conversion kits' to anyone, the thirteen year old mentality was just too prevalent among distributors, and arcade operators. So most of these 'Homo conversion kits' just languished unsold in warehouses, a few were actually sold and installed, but not many. The conversion kit consisted of a marquee (very plain, just said 'Homo' on it), a PCB, and an instruction manual. You were expected to supply your own spinner and buttons. The game itself ran on a boardset nearly identical to the original "Goindol" (of course the components were much lower in quality).

Hot Chase was not particularly successful for Konami, and this is due in part to the host hardware falling short of the ambitious design brief. There's so much happeneing on screen - particularly in the later levels - that the action can become very jerky and certain sprites often seem to have a mind of their own. It's no surprise that in an age dominated by arcade conversions, Hot Chase wasn't converted to a single home gaming system.

Hunchback (c) 1983 Century Electronics.


A classic and much-copied platform game in which the player takes on the role of the eponymous bell-ringer, Quasimodo, in his quest to rescue the beautiful Esmerelda from the tower of the castle fortress. Quasi must complete a number of static screens, each presenting the player with different obstacles, to reach Esmerelda. These range from spear-toting guards, to firey chasms to missiles (fireballs or arrows) that must be jumped. Some of the trickier screens can contain more than one of these obstacles, such as spear-toting guards AND missles.


One final problem that appears on every screen is the time limit. This takes the form of an enemy guard climbing the castle walls, if the soldier reaches the top, he will try to burn the Hunchback with his torch. If the Hunchback rings the bell before the guard has scaled the wall, a bonus score is rewarded.

- TRIVIA -


Released in September 1983.


This video game is based on the novel 'Le Bossu de Notre Dame', or 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame', by Victor Hugo.


The name Quasimodo translates as 'half-formed'.


The hunchback character was originally to be 'Robin Hood'. Hence the green costume and the game stages with arrows. The artist (who drew the Robin Hood character) left the company before the decision to change the theme to 'Hunchback'. By the time a new artist was taken on, the green costume had become accepted and no-one questioned it (someone commented that the Robin Hood character, as drawn, looked like a hunchback).


Roberto Picelli holds the official record for this game with 478,700 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Scoring points is based on how quickly you can finish a round, although there is no actual on-screen indication as to how much bonus time is left. No points are awarded for merely jumping over obstacles. The best way to achieve a high score is to complete five consecutive screens without losing a life; at the end of each stage a bell is awarded, and once five bells are collected in this way, a Super Bonus worth between 10000 and 30000 points is awarded.


- PORTS -


Hunchback was converted to home computers by Ocean Software of Manchester, England and was their first ever arcade conversion.

$info=hustle,

Hustle (c) 1977 Gremlin.


HUSTLE is a 1- or 2-player video game which challenges players' reaction time as they attempt to build up a high score. The object of the game is to maneuver a moving arrow into targets which appear randomly on the screen. Each arrow is accompanied by a tail, which can be used to block the opponent from scoring targets.


TARGETS : The targets appear randomly on the playfield. The position of a target, the value of a target, the time a target stays on the screen, and the time before a target appears are all unpredictable : There are never more than two targets on the screen at any time.


To add to the unpredictability, some targets appear with a value of ???. These are mystery targets, and can have a value from -900 points to +900 points. Players go after the mystery targets at their own risk since the only way to determine whether or not a mystery target is positive or negative is to hit the target. Whenever a target is scored, the game pauses while the appropriate player's score is tallied. Two distinctive sounds accompany the scoring, depending on whether the target score is positive or negative. All non-mystery targets (which are all positive), and all mystery targets (which have positive values) are scored with an attention-getting warble sound. All mystery targets which prove to be negative are scored with a distinctive penalty sound.


CRASHES : A crash (accompanied by a loud boom sound) occurs whenever a player hits anything other than a target. The three obstacles a player might hit are one of the screen boundaries, the other player's tail, or his own tail. Whenever a crash occurs, the opponent scores 400 points PLUS all target values on the screen. If any mystery targets are on the screen during a crash, their values are revealed, and they are awarded to the opponent. All mystery targets whose values are revealed as the result of a crash are scored positive for the opponent.


GAME SPEED : The game begins with the players moving at a moderate pace. Every time a target is scored, the pace picks up slightly. After ten targets have been scored without a crash, the pace stays at a maximum rate. Whenever a crash occurs, the pace reverts to its initial moderate value, and increases with each score, as before.


TAIL LENGTH : Whenever a crash occurs, both players' tails grow longer. The game plays quite differently as it progresses. At the beginning of a game, both players have short tails and are highly maneuverable. At this stage the game is a "foot race" to score the targets. As players crash and tails get longer, a blocking strategy is added to the race for the targets. This constantly changing nature of the game is designed to provide long-lasting appeal, and insure a long earning history.


SINGLE PLAYER : HUSTLE has been designed to be just as exciting for one player as it is for two. A single player plays against himself, and not against the computer.


The single player game is initiated by simply pressing the ONE PLAYER START button instead of the TWO PLAYER START button after inserting a coin. The controls for one player are located on the right side of the control panel. The game plays the same as for two players, with these exceptions :

1. There is a single arrow and tail, instead of two.

2. Crashes are scored as PENALTY points, with the same score as in the two player game. That is, a crash scores 400 plus all on-screen targets into the PENALTY score.

3. At the end of the game, the PENALTY points are subtracted from the player's score.


The object of the single player game is to rack up as many points as possible. The game action is the same as the two player game, with the lengthening tail and the accelerating pace.

- TRIVIA -


Released in May 1977.


To promote the game, Gremlin sent two scantily-clad 'Gremlin Girls' on a 12-city tour where they took on all comers at the game. Players who won 2 out of 3 games won a hundred dollar bill. The company claimed that out of 1233 challengers, only seven won the cash.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


FREE GAMES : For areas of the country where free games are legal, HUSTLE can be set to award free games for scores of 11,000, 13,000, 15,000 or 17,000 points. The game is shipped with the free game option disabled. If free games are legal in your area, it is highly recommended that you enable them --- they provide an extremely powerful incentive to play the game. Free games are awarded only in the single player game, since the two player game could give free games any time two players cooperated to give one of the players a very high score.


It is not possible to win two free games in a row (i.e. no free games on free games). Whenever free games are enabled, the message SCORE XX000 POINTS FOR FREE GAME appears on the screen just after the ONE PLAYER START button is pressed. The XX will be 11, 13, 15, or 17 depending on how you jumper the game. This message is displayed for about 5 seconds, and then the single player game begins. Whenever a free game is won, the message FREE GAME! is momentarily displayed on the screen, followed by the message PRESS START. If at this point ONE PLAYER START is pressed, the free game score message will not be displayed before the game starts, since a second consecutive free game will not be awarded. It is also possible to press the TWO PLAYER START after a free game is awarded and play a two player game.


GAME TIME : The top margin of the game contains the word TIME, with a two digit timer above it. The game starts with a time value of 90, and decrements to 0, at which time the game is over. The timer actually counts player moves rather than 'ticking' once per second. Also, the timer stops during all scoring. These effects produce a repeatable game time of about 2 minutes.


It is possible to shorten the game time to about 1-1/2 minutes by changing an internal jumper. In this case, the timer still begins at 90, but it ticks faster.

Hydra (c) 1990 Atari Games.


An abstract racing game in which the player takes on the role of a special government courier, who must deliver a number of secret cargoes to their various destinations at the end of each stage. Gameplay consists of piloting a heavily-armed hovercraft over a series of waterways, avoiding or destroying the enemy craft and barriers that litter each level. Progress is hampered by mines, enemy hovercraft, logs and other obstacles. Money bags can be collected as well as extra fuel.


On-board fuel depletes at a steady pace and players must keep a look out for additional fuel cells. In addition to a forward-firing gun, the hovercraft is equipped with a 'Boost' function. Providing the player has enough boost fuel, the craft can be made to fly in the air for a limited time; useful for avoiding enemies and barriers, as well as for gaining access to certain bonus items.

- TRIVIA -


Released in October 1983.


This game is known in US as "Track and Field".


This game is a resounding success, especially amongst real-life athletes who live to take out their aggression on animate or inanimate objects. The game inspires an all-new level of two-player competition in arcades.


The song that is heard at the high score screen and at the commendation screen is 'Chariots of fire' which was written by Vangelis.


- UPDATES -


Later versions of this game replace the two 'Run' buttons with a trackball.


The bootleg version features different speech, as the original sound hardware could not be totally hacked - the slightly different voices are allegedly those of the bootleggers themselves! Also, it contains a typo : the word HEIGHT replaces the original HIGHT.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hidden Bonus : When you get to the javelin throw, run fast and then hold the angle button down, making the javelin soar high into the air. If it gets high enough, it'll hit a bird, which will fall and give you 1000 points.


* Hidden Bonus 2 : On the high jump, if you fail your first two jumps then qualify on the third, a little mole pops up and you get a bonus.


* Hidden Bonus 3 : In the 100 metres, if you manage to get a dead heat with the computer (i.e. the same time) you get a 1000 point bonus.

- TRIVIA -


While not quite achieving the commercial and critical succes of "Track and Field", Hyper Sports still proved to be very popular among gamers and, like its prequel, really came into its own as a highly addictive multi-player experience.


Licensed to Centuri for US manufacture and distribution.


This game is known outside Japan as "Hyper Olympic '84".


This game is a resounding success, especially amongst real-life athletes who live to take out their aggression on animate or inanimate objects. The game inspires an all-new level of two-player competition in arcades.


Kelly Kobashigawa holds the official record for this game with 538,340 points.


* BUG : If you 'get a mole' on the pole vault, but the jump qualifies as a world record, you will not be awarded your bonus points.


* BUG 2 : The game lists 'Today's Top 10', but these are actually the 4th to 13th inclusive highest scores ever. The 14th to 20th highest scores ever are also stored, but never displayed - this is why the first game after switching on a well-used machine generally gets ranked 21st. The 1st to 3rd highest scores ever are displayed on a seperate screen labeled ''Hyper Medalist''.


* Oddity : If your time runs out on a weight lift and you have one red and two white lights displayed, the lift will be counted as successful. This is in accordance with actual competition weight lifting rules.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


SWIMMING-100M FREESTYLE  :

* After a few seconds of swimming, 'breath' will appear, press the UP button to take a breath and continue swimming. To swim better, try to predict when you will need to take a breath, this is approximately every 2-3 seconds.

* If the two middle swimmers achieve a dead-heat, a frog appears and a 3,000 points bonus is awarded.


SKEET SHOOTING :

* Use GO (LEFT and RIGHT) buttons to shoot either the left or right target respectively. Try to hit an many consecutive targets as possible : If the player hits everything perfect then a bird will fly past. Hit that and the player is awarded a 3,000 point bonus.

* Shoot the final object with the left hand side target and a parrot will fly from right to left. This can be hit repeatedly for 1,000 points.


LONG HORSE :

* Press UP when you are at the end of the spring board, you will then spring onto the horse. Wait until you are in a fully upright handstand then press UP again to leap off the horse. Once in the air, hit the GO buttons repeatedly to spin. Ensure that your feet are facing the ground as you land.

* After launching from the horse, tap a RUN button to rotate so you land on your head. An object falls from the sky and a 3,000 poins bonus is awarded.


ARCHERY :

* First, hit GO (LEFT and RIGHT) buttons to set the wind. Then hold the UP button until the angle gets to about 5.0', release the button and hope it hits the middle of the board. A 'nice' is achieved if a bullseye is made. If you get 8 nices, in the first or second round, you will move onto the next round where you can earn more points. There is a point bonus for getting all 'nices'; in the first round it is 3,000 points, in the second round it is 4,000 points and in the third round it is 6,000 points. If you get all 'nices', the moving target will be replaced by an apple, which can be hit for an increasing number of bonus points. When the apples appear, there is no angle factor, you just have to hit the button to fire the arrow.


TRIPLE JUMP :

* Press GO (LEFT and RIGHT) buttons repeatedly to gain speed. Then hold UP to get an angle of 45'; when you land you will take one step forward, press UP only when you have taken a step, then try to get a 45' angle again. Repeat for the final jump. If you hold UP just as your foot hits the board, you will get a distance boost.

* If your jump starts right on the line and also has the angles of 35, 41, and then 45 degress, a rocket flies past and a 3,000 point bonus is awarded.  Note that this bonus is not seen if the jump sets a new world record.


WEIGHT LIFTING :

* Press GO (LEFT and RIGHT) buttons repeatedly to build up the weight-lifter's power. When he has enough power, he will lift up the weights and they will flash. Then whilst it is flashing, press UP. He will then stretch out his arms and you will have to keep pressing GO (LEFT and RIGHT) for him to keep it held above his head for 3 Beeps. When the 3 Beeps are over, you've qualified.

* Following a successful lift, pressing both run buttons the instant the dropped weights hit the floor causes 3 girls to be displayed, holding a '1000' sign. A 1,000 points bonus is awarded.


POLE VAULT :

* This is by far the trickiest event of the game. Press GO buttons to start the run. Then as you near the silver pole trap, hold UP and the pole will lower towards the trap (the closer it is, the more power you will get for the next part). Keep holding UP until you reach the top of the bar, then release. You will then let go of the pole and vault over. Hold UP just as you get half way over the bar and you will 'drift' to the right and hopefully over the bar itself. Once your character has let go of the pole, hitting the GO buttons can increase the height of the vault.

I, Robot (c) 1983 Atari.


I, Robot is a 3-D shoot-em-up in which the player controls the "Interface Robot (#1984)" in a rebellion against the all-controlling Big Brother and his ever-watchful 'Evil Eyes'.


The game is set over a series of platform-based stages constructed from solid coloured blocks and to complete a stage, the player must "eliminate the red zones". This is achieved by moving the robot over all of a stage's horizontal surfaces, changing their colour from red to blue. In order to reach all of the platforms and surfaces, the Interface robot will need to jump. This must be carefully timed, however, as jumping is not allowed under Big Brother's regime and his Evil eye will open at regular intervals to watch over the interface robot. Should the eye turn red while the robot is mid-jump, he will be spotted and destroyed, costing the player a life.


Once all of the red squares on a stage, the enemy's shield is destroyed and the Interface Robot will automatically shoot and destroy that stage's Evil Eye before launching itself into space from the top of the pyramid on which the eye was located. A small space-flight to the next stage then follows, with three-dimensional objects hurling through space that must be either avoided or destroyed.


Every third terrain contains a red pyramid which the Robot must enter after destroying the Evil Eye. Once inside the pyramid, the Robot has one chance to collect as many of the jewels as possible before once again destroying that stage's Evil Eye. If the Robot is destroyed while inside the pyramid, he is immediately thrust back into space. The player must then battle through three more terrains and destroy a further three Evil Eyes before he has another chance to collect the jewels inside of the pyramid.


I, Robot was very much ahead of its time and the game featured many new and ground-breaking innovations that the games industry would later adopt. The most striking and obvious of these was the game's graphics. While I, Robot wasn't the world's first fully three-dimensional game (Atari's own "Battlezone" had been released three years earlier), it was the first game to feature solid, filled-polygon graphics, as opposed to the wireframe graphics adopted by other three-dimensional games of the time. The concept of the player being able to switch viewpoints also appeared here first, and is activated by pressing the game's 'Start' button. The final innovation was 'Doodle City'. Instead of playing the game, players could instead choose to use the game's colourful three-dimenional object to draw pictures on the monitor screen.


- TECHNICAL -


There was only one kind of I, Robot machine made, the upright dedicated cabinet. The only other game that used this exact cabinet was "Firefox", although the "Major Havoc" cabinet was similar. The best way to describe this cabinet is to say that it looked really top heavy. This cabinet wasn't just a straight up and down affair; the monitor area, control panel, and bottom section were all different sizes and the whole machine flared out at the bottom. The game featured partial sideart in the form of a field of red, blue, and yellow blocks floating in a field of stars. The marquee showed an 'I, Robot' logo composed of 3-D multicolored blocks. There were no important decorations on the control panel or monitor bezel, although the monitor did have a pair of grill-like plastic plates on either side of it. The action was controlled with a single 'Hall Effect' joystick mounted centrally and a camera button on the side of the control panel. This joystick was a fairly new kind of gaming control, but it never did catch on, a few other titles such as "Road Runner" used this stick, but they are almost impossible to find today. A joystick that worked off of magnetic fields probably wasn't the best idea anyway. Some people have managed to replace these joysticks with other kinds of analog sticks, but it requires custom work, and doesn't have the same feel as the Hall Effect stick.

- TRIVIA -


I, Robot was an utterly unique arcade experience, with several innovations that were frankly years ahead of their time : SOLID 3-D polygons, at a time when the first "Star Wars" game's wire frame antics were still blowing everyone away, appeared HERE first. Selectable camera angles; now a staple of 3d games, were another innovation that I, Robot introduced to the gaming world. The game's very uniqueness would also prove its downfall. Arcade goers of the time were seemingly unable to cope with the game's surrealism and groundbreaking graphics and I, Robot was a commercial flop. Approximately 1,000 units were produced and shipped worldwide but Atari only sold around 500 of them.


I, Robot was originally called "Ice Castles" and consisted of three boards rather than the usual two. At the time of I, Robot's development, Atari exercised the somewhat unusual policy of awarding bonuses to engineers based entirely on revenue from sales of the machines, WITHOUT taking into account the amount of engineering resources (man years) spent developing it. In other words, just the sales revenue minus the manufacturing cost. Consequently, Atari's engineers were motivated to spend ridiculous amounts of time doing little more than reducing the manufacturing cost. They decided that the only way to reduce the cost of the game hardware was to replace a lot of TTL logic with an ASIC. Unfortunately, they assigned very inexperienced people to do the ASIC design. The resulting chip had very low yield; it's unlikely that ANY of them worked over the normal voltage and temperature ranges that commercial semiconductors are normally rated for. By this time, however, the game was so late that they weren't allowed to fix the ASIC problems. Apart from the time it would take to redo the chip, fixing it would also require putting it in a larger package with more power and ground pins, and so the board would have to be redone as well.

So for each production unit they just tried chips until they found one that seemed to work, and shipped the unit. They threw away a lot of chips.


- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is a little complicated since many things score differently (even the same things can score differently) :

Birds, Balls, Spiked Balls, etc on the Platforms : 25-100 points

Polygon Asteroids, Pyramids, Cones, etc in Space : 1-300 points


Once you destroy the Eye on the Platforms round, you get whatever bonus is left. Bonuses are variable per Platform and range from 3000 to 7000 points and decrement as you play.


You get 100 points per jewel collected when you take out the Eye in the control area. There are a maximum of ten jewels in the control area. Your maximum score you can get, though, is 999 points.


In space, you get points for everything you can kill.


If your score is greater then the BEST time on the Platforms or the BEST score in Space, you get a bonus of 2,500 points. You do not receive this bonus if you get killed on the Platform or in Space and have to start again.


When you enter a transporter pod, you get 20,000 points/level skipped if you successfully complete the Platform you transported to. You can only go to level 79 this way.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hints for Game Play :

1) The player can advance to higher play levels while inside the Transporter.

2) Objects to be destroyed for points include a buzz saw, a soccer ball, a small ball dropped by a bird, the polygons, and a rolling log.

3) The player can achieve a bonus for shooting all of the tetrahedrons in a space wave. The player can also achieve bonus points by spelling I ROBOT by shooting the letters as they appear sequentially in space waves.

4) The player must shoot the polygons with SEVEN shots in order to destroy them and achieve points.


* Warp : Hold down both Start buttons when entering the transporter on level 1. You can now warp as high as level 10.


PLATFORMS :


* One block of claimed area will reduce the shield strength down by one. The shield strength is basically the total of all these unclaimed blocks per level. So if you see a shield strength of two, but don't see any unclaimed areas, this means you will definitely have to look around for them.


* Some Platform levels only have a few blocks separated by gaps while others have long walkways also separated by gaps. You must bridge the gaps between these blocks. To bridge any gap :

a) The game will show you when a gap can be bridged. The section under your robot will blink and a corresponding section across the gap will blink.

b) Bridges created are the same color that other claimed areas are.

c) If you jump when the Eye is open, your robot will be destroyed by the Eye.


* Sometimes unclaimed areas are hidden behind blocks. Use the point of view buttons to look for these areas.


* Your robot is equipped with lasers. They are useful when taking out the smaller objects such as birds and spiked balls. They won't work on the big beach balls or the walkway grinders.


* Using the above tip, remember to constantly shoot when you are jumping. Your lasers only fire toward the eye regardless of which way you jump. This usually prevents something from hitting your robot in mid-flight.


* Watch the shield below the Eye. The number will go down as long as you claim areas on the walkways.  If the number is at one or two and you don't see any unclaimed areas, change your point of view and look around for unclaimed areas.


* There are indestructible creatures called ''Point of View'' killers. If you don't change your point of view by the time these things make it to your robot, your robot will be destroyed.


* In the middle, at the bottom of the screen is a phrase showing you how often the Eye opens and closes.  This time is variable so you need to check out the bottom of the screen to see the frequency the eye opens. If there isn't a time, then it is once every five seconds.


* Keep in mind, you are on a timer. This basically means planning out in advance of where you want to move since there isn't really any time to sit around and take in the scenery.


* You must land on the unclaimed block in front of the eye in order to destroy it.


* Every third level, after you destroy the Eye from the outside, you will be able to enter a control area to take on the Eye in its environment. To make your job harder, a buzz saw starts at the back of this platform and eats it away toward the Eye. In addition, you may have to blast through walls in order to get the jewels and proceed toward the eye.


SPACE :


* The best way to get through this area is to rapidly shoot. Most objects require at least five to ten shots to take them out.


* Never let the tetras go. If you don't destroy them, they will come around from the backside and destroy your robot.


* There are other enemies such as tankers. If you hit them, they get mad and hit your robot from the backside if you don't destroy them.


* You can't destroy the saucers, but you can lead them into the rocks to kill them.


* You can also maneuver around the shapes but in the later levels, this is made harder by the life ring shaped objects that are on the outer edges.


* Every fourth level, you have to deal with a three-dimensional head.  Although not particularly tough, it is a nuisance :

a) Fire at one side of the head to force it to rotate around. If the head isn't facing your robot, the danger is minimized considerably since he won't fire his cone-shaped projectiles at your robot.

b) You must hit every cone-shaped projectile fired from the head. If you don't, they come around and hit your robot from the backside.

c) You will have to survive this encounter for about 20 seconds. After that, you will be done with that part of the level.


* If you successfully destroy the letters IROBOT during the Space part of the level, you get a 5000 point bonus.


* After level two, you must successfully land your robot on the next level Platform.

Ikari (c) 1986 SNK.


SNK's answer to Capcom's 'Commando', released a year earlier, one or two players take on the role of a 'Rambo-esque' soldier as they fight on land and water to reach the village of Ikari. most of the action takes place on foot, although players will occasionally stumble across un-occupied enemy tanks which can be entered and driven. Standing between the players and their destination are a multitude of enemy soldiers, tanks, helicopters and static gun emplacements.


Each different enemy soldier-type is equipped with a different weapon, such as a semi-automatic machine gun, automatic machine gun, grenades, and super grenades. To assist the players in their struggle, a number of power-ups can be picked up, such as extended shot range and hand-grenades. As the players' munitions are depletable, additional ammo/grenades must to be picked up along the way. players can also enter tanks, which offer increased firepower as well as resistence to enemy shots. Too many enemy hits, however, will eventually see the tank explode - this is proceeded by a warning flash to allow the player to leave the tank before the explosion takes place. Should the player be caught inside when the tank explodes, a life is lost.


Unlike Capcom's 'Commando', Ikari features 360 degree gameplay, as a result of this the home conversions could never hope to match the arcade machine's rotary joystick controls.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When driving a tank, try to avoid upgrading from cannonballs to missiles. Cannonballs explode as supergrenades, making it easier to hit gates and squadrons of men. Missiles, unfortunately, only take out one obstacle and will explode upon reaching their maximum range, which is rarely where you'd like the explosions to be.


* There are times when incoming missile triggers are impossible to avoid in the tank. A bug in the machine maximizes the number of explosions that can be onscreen at one time. When you MUST run over a trigger, fire off three shots rapidly timed to explode when the missile lands. With luck, the computer will be unable to generate the explosion and you and your tank can continue.

Image Fight (c) 1988 Irem.


A vertically scrolling shoot-em-up with an original premise. The game's first 5 stages are supposed to be a 'simulation' and serve as training to test the player's abilities. Player's will receive a penalty if their hit-ratio is too low.


Once players have proved themselves on the opening stages, they will progress to the game's last 3 stages, blasting off into space on a mission to destroy the alien vegetation surrounding the Moon's main computer. If the player fails in the mission, they must endure the dreaded 'Penalty Zone'. Features a high level of challenge, a wide variety of weapons and the ability to change speed.


If the player's ship is equipped with one or more red/blue extra guns, pushing both ACTION buttons simultaneously will sling the guns forward in a boomerang-like fashion. This is a powerful and destructive method and can be done an unlimited number of times.

In The Hunt (c) 1993 Irem.


In the Hunt is a sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two-players. Each player takes control of a submarine and must shoot their way through the game's six levels as they are attacked from both beneath the water in which the submarine moves (by enemy subs, gun emplacements, mines etc.), as well from above the water-line, by boats, jet fighters and helicopters. Numerous power-ups can be collected to boost the sub's meagre fire-power. 


The game was created by the same team behind the legendary "R-Type" series, with In The Hunt's superbly-rendered graphics being very similar in style to Irem's "R-Type Leo", released a year earlier. In The Hunt would prove to be Irem's last 'traditional' arcade shoot'em up, although two further R-Type sequels were released for home consoles (see R-Type "Series" section for further info).

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (c) 1985 Atari Games.


The player takes on the role of action movie hero, Indiana Jones, in a game that takes place over 3 different zones; the mines, a minecart chase and the temple. The first level features a number of platforms, ladders and slides and Indy must free kidnapped children by finding their cages and whipping them open.


The player must also keep an eye out for rattlesnakes and Thuggee guards. The second zone is a recreation of the infamous minecart chase in the movie and the player must guide Indy's cart to the bottom of the mine; keeping ahead of enemy carts and voiding traps and track-side enemies. The final area takes place in the temple itself and Indy must make his way to the altar and retrieve the Sankara stone. Indy must avoid guards and also flaming hearts thrown by the game's enemy boss, Mola Ram.


The player can choose to start the game on any one of 3 difficulty levels : easy, medium and hard. These are selected at the beginning of the game by entering the corresponding door. Once all 3 Sankara stones have been collected, Indy must work his way through a final mine and minecart section, before making his escape on the rope bridge and facing Mola Ram once and for all. Playing the easy level will not include this level the first time Indy acquires all three stones. Instead, a message will appear stating that Indy escaped on the rope bridge. The player is then returned to the game, starting again on a more difficult mines level.

This was Skelly's second game for Gottlieb, but it was never released. Number produced estimated at 1 or 2 units. This game represents Skelly's own answer to "Robotron - 2084".


The cool thing about Insector is the three-letter code in at the start. Tim Skelly used this value as a seed for each player's pseudo random number generator. That way, if you want exactly the same game every time, you enter the same three letters. If you wanted to handicap yourself, you would enter different letters and let the other player enter their usual letters, etc.

Time bonus : 50 points per guard who spots you.

Collecting an object : 300 points.

Collecting secret plans : points remaining on counter.

Leaving the embassy : points remaining on counter.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Always enter the rooms in the order 4, 3, 2, 1, 5. This way you get the jetshoes first as they are always on the 4th floor, and the guards are furthest away from you.


* Never exit a room until all the guards have entered. This way you won't bump into one outside, where they are harder to avoid.


* Always leave the embassy by jumping off the roof with the umbrella, as you get more points as it's a quicker route out.


* When the guards have all entered the room, wait until they get close to you, before running for the exit. They can only turn at 90 degrees and you can outrun them.

Invader's Revenge (c) 1979 Zenitone Microsec.


Invader's Revenge is a simple two-dimensional shooter. You control your fighter to defend your supply against an endless stream of alien invaders. Once you clear out one wave of 6 invaders, another wave comes in to take your fuel. After seven waves of alien invaders, you will then be given the chance to dock with your base to refuel. Of course, you have to navigate the hazards to get to your base. Your objective is simple, prevent the aliens from taking or destroying your fuel supply.

- TRIVIA -


Invader's Revenge was one of a long string of "Space Invaders" clones to hit the market after the runaway success of Space Invaders in 1978. This game was developed by a company within the United Kingdom. Zenitone Microsec also went on to develop other Space Invader clones such as "Super Invaders" and "Space Attack II". All these games were distributed in Europe, Invader's Revenge was distributed in Germany by Dutchford.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your fighter will be in the middle, at the bottom of the screen above the fuel storage area with 26 units of fuel. Your goal is to blast the invaders into dust. Each wave of invaders consists of six alien ships. You will go through seven waves of invaders before you have a chance to dock.  The order of the invaders is (by their point value) : 10, 20, 30, 50, 20, 30, and 50.


* The alien invaders will attempt to make you lose your fuel one of two ways :

a) By getting to the bottom of the screen and actually picking up the fuel to bring back to the UFO. You can shoot these aliens down to recover a fuel unit.

b) The aliens will drop bombs upon your fuel supply to cause you to lose a unit. These bombs can be shot down.


* Just like the original game, when the invaders get to the left or right side of the screen, they will drop down a level. In addition to dropping down, an invader may peel away from the formation and head down to attempt to take one of your fuel units.


* Learn the different formations the invaders show. Some of the formations are :

a) In a straight line across.

b) In two straight lines across.

c) In a staggered formation that resembles a '>' or '<'.

d) One invader on each row for six rows.


* When shot, some invaders don't explode. Instead, you literally will shoot them down. After they are shot, the invader will head straight toward your fighter. Make sure you quickly move from under an invader after you have shot it to prevent this from happening.


* As in "Space Invaders", shoot the right or leftmost invader to prevent them from dropping another level down. In addition, the fewer invaders there are, the faster they travel across the screen.  Make sure you adjust for this.


* Your primary objective is to prevent the invaders from stealing or destroying your fuel supply. If you lose all of your fuel, your game will be over regardless of the number of fighters you have left.


* Docking can be quite a chore. You must navigate around some space debris in order to get to your base to refuel. Watch your fuel supply because you can burn it up very quickly if you're not careful.


* As the game progresses, the invaders get more aggressive and will send down two or even three of their numbers to attempt to steal your fuel. In addition, the UFO at the top of the screen moves back and forth to drop bombs on you.


* Learn to conserve your firepower and only shoot at sure targets. The reason  is the fact you can only have one shot on the screen at any time.


* Since there is no cover, make sure you are moving around constantly. If you don't move your fighter around, you are just inviting trouble to happen.

Invinco / Deep Scan (c) 1980 Sega.


Invinco is a game inspired by "Space Invaders", with some innovation on the aliens: One row blinks in and out of view, another row's aliens roll so as to make themselves harder or easier to hit, and a 3rd row of aliens each take (at least) 3 hits to kill. A 4th row has aliens that turn into bombs, blowing up everything around them to make your job somewhat easier.

Invinco / Head On 2 (c) 1979 Sega.


Head On 2 is a 2-D maze racing game. You control your car through the maze to pick up the dots while at the same time avoiding the car, or cars, that are constantly trying to ram you. Successfully get through one maze and many more await you. This is good practice for freeway driving in the big city.

Light Blue Aliens : 400 ponts

Top Blue Aliens : 800 points

UFOs : 1,000 - 2,000 points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


For Head On 2 :


* Always be aware of where the Jam Car(s) is/are located. They can only make one lane change at a time but that lane change may be into your lane.


* The faster you go, the fewer lanes you can cross. At full acceleration, you will only be able to change one lane at a time. In the earlier levels, this will be fine since you will only be dealing with one car. In the multiple Jam Car levels, this can be a very bad thing. Decelerate (take your finger off the accelerate button) to go across multiple lanes.


* The Jam Car(s) always travel in a clockwise motion while you travel in a counterclockwise motion. Remember that so that you don't get confused when there are multiple cars in the maze. Also, the color of the Jam Car is red while yours is white.


* Don't try to get all the dots on one of the lanes. You need to anticipate where your next move is well before you enter the lane change area since you cannot change lanes at any other time. Sometimes, on the earlier levels, it is best to do a staggered type dot pickup where you do lane one, change to lane two, to lane three, lane four, lane five, then back to lane one. If you time it right, the Jam Car or Cars will still be in the maze.


* Don't let the speed of the Jam Car(s) throw you. Just plan to be out of your lane and in the lane change area before them. If both cars enter at the same time, you run a big risk of a collision.


For Invinco :


* Time your shots when aiming at certain targets. The white aliens turn invisible on you, so try to hit them when they're visible on the screen. Also, there's a period of time that the top aliens are invulnerable to your shots while they change to another form; wait a second or so before shooting them again so you don't waste shots and time.

Ivan Ironman Stewart's Super Off-Road (c) 1989 Leland.


In his never ending quest for adventure and excitement, man invented off-road racing. These races were then brought before the masses by converting huge sports stadiums into dirt and mud obstacle courses in which off-road 'Ironmen' battled for top honors.


Now THE LELAND CORPORATION brings this fast moving, hard driving sport to the video game arena.


Ivan IRONMAN Stewart's SUPER OFF-ROAD is stadium off-road racing at it's best. One to three players are asked to test their dirt track skills against the best dirt truck driver in the world.


Contestants compete on 8 different tracks with a total of 16 configurations and these courses are packed with enough jumps, bumps, hills, and holes to challenge even the most skillful driver.


Winning drivers earn 'cash' prizes, and use this 'cash' to 'buff out' their machines. At the end of each race, players take their trucks to the 'Speed Shop' to buy better shocks, tires, engines, and higher top speed. They can also buy nitro packs to help them blast over the jumps and through the mud.


The 'Convert-a-Credit' feature allows drivers to add to their winnings by using credits as 'cash'. Each additional quarter, when converted, becomes $200,000.00 in game 'cash' and this additional 'cash' may be used for purchases in the 'Speed Shop'.

Released in April 1989.


Ivan Ironman Stewart's Super Off-Road is the first arcade game to feature Dynamic Play Adjustment (DPA), the cpu would change the speed and skill of the grey car (supposedly Mr. Stewart himself) in relation to your performance in the game, in order to ensure high earnings and close contests.


Ivan Stewart is a legend in Off-Road racing. He gained his nickname 'Ironman' as a result of competing in many marathon treks through the desert. Each time he won a Baja 500 or Baja 1000 race, held in the heat of Mexico, Stewart received an 'Ironman' award. Mickey Thompson, the man behind the Off-Road Championship Grand Prix Series began referring to Ivan Stewart as 'The Ironman of Off-Road Racing' after he picked up the Drivers' Points Championship in two successive years. While the tag has been shortened a bit, the title 'Ironman' has stuck.


An upgrade kit for this game exists and is called 'The Track-Pack' (see Updates section for more info).

* The Track Pack : This upgrade contains eight brand-new tracks which are : Shortcut, Cutt-off Pass, Pig Bog, Rio Trio, Leapin' Lizards, Redoubt About, Boulder Hill and Volcano Valley.

Jack the Giantkiller (c) 1982 Cinematronics.


This game plays a lot like "Donkey Kong" except that the controls are not quite as smooth. There are 5 screens to master if you want to help Jack in his mission. You do not get to play each screen at first, they are added on as you progress through the game. The first time through the game skips from screen 1 right to screen 4.

* The 1st screen is fairly simple, you just have to climb to the top of the beanstalk. There are a few enemies, but they can be defeated by simply tossing beans at them. You can find the beans scattered all around the stalk, and picking one up adds one to your ammunition count (or two, depending on the dip switch settings).

* In the 2nd screen, Jack manuevers through the clouds and attempts to cross the drawbridge into the castle, but lions and birds stand in his way.

* The 3rd screen has Jack climbing the castle stairway in a scene that was obviously inspired by "Donkey Kong". Avoid the cat and the mouse and you can make it to the top.

* On the 4th screen you have to jump from platform to platform until you reach the giant's lair. There will be several treasures, grab the flashing one and try to make your escape.

* The 5th screen is the first one again, except that this time you are climbing down the beanstalk, and you have falling rocks to dodge, and the giant himself may even be after you (that one depends on the level).


After making it back to your house you get to watch a little intermission before going after the next treasure. There are four different treasures altogether. The last one is the princess, when you have her the giant himself will follow you down the beanstalk, and you must chop it down to defeat him. After rescuing the princess the game starts over with increased difficulty.


- TECHNICAL -


Jack The Giantkiller was available in 2 different dedicated cabinets, and upright and a cocktail. The cocktail one really lent itself to easy conversion due to the large control panels, so the upright is far more common. The upright machine came in a conservatively designed cabinet that had curves instead of sharp angles. This same cabinet was also used for "Zzyzzyxx", "Naughty Boy", and "Boxing Bugs". The marquee showed Jack about to get squished by a giant boot as he runs over clouds toward the beanstalk, while carrying the golden goose. The sideart was a large sticker and it showed Jack scaling an immense beanstalk while a bearded giant points at him with a menacing look on his face. The monitor bezel shows a few more images of Jack and the Giant, while the control panel contained game instructions. The one really nice thing about the artwork on this machine was that it all actually appears to have been done by the same artist, in the same style, with the same color scheme. So many games seem to have trouble with that. The cocktail version of the game came in a small table format that had woodgrained sides, and control panels on either end. Most cocktail tables tended to have tiny control panels that were in strange places, but the panels on this game were full sized, and were right up next to the monitor with only a slight downward slant to them. The game's top glass had beanstalk graphics bordering the screen, and the control panel overlays were exactly the same as the upright machine, except for a few stripes, and the lack of start buttons on panel for the second player. Some game cabinets just scream out 'easy conversion' to the arcade operator, and this was one of them. The large control panels and 19'' monitor meant that you could easily convert this one into almost anything, so that is what happened to almost all of them. Only the "Joust" cocktail seemed to be even better for conversions, as it had the players sitting side by side. Both machines used a standard 19'' arcade monitor and used a unique wiring harness that was not JAMMA compatible.

Jackal (c) 1986 Konami.


1 or 2 players operate a jeep and must battle their way through a huge, vertically scrolling battlefield. Their mission is to save PoWs and deliver them to the nearest helicopter pad so they can be flown to safety. The hostages are trapped in enemy buildings and PoW camps, which must be destroyed in order to release the prisoners. The jeep can only carry up to a maximum of eight PoWs, the current amount being carried is displayed in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.


The jeep is armed with a machine gun and a grenade thrower, the latter of which can be powered-up into a missile launcher. As well as huge numbers of enemy troops and static gun emplacements, the players must also contend with enemy jeeps, tanks, boats, submarines and planes. The final part of the game takes place in the enemy stronghold and the game ends when the final enemy gun emplacements are destroyed.

The player controls a lonely police officer whose job it is to kill the hordes of escaped convicts and, eventually, rescue the kidnapped warden. Each level also has a number of civilian hostages that also roam the levels and need to be rescued.


The player begins the game with only a pistol, but 2 extra weapons, in the form of a bazooka and a tear gas gun, can be collected. The 'Weapon Select' button cycles through the player's weapons via a display at the bottom of the screen. When the desired weapon is highlighted, pressing the Fire button will select and fire the desired weapon.


Hostages will randomly run across the screen and can be rescued by running into them. Should the player accidentally shoot a hostage, all extra weapons will be lost leaving only the pistol.

This game is known in Japan as "Manhattan 24 Bunsho - NY 151 Nishi Dai 100 Street".


Jail Break's premise of a city overrun with convicts and a kidnapped ViP is based upon John Carpenter's 1981 film, 'Escape From New York'.


Donn Nauert holds the official record for this game with 185,900 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Easter Egg : From the beginning of the game, rescue four hostages in a row; you have to do this to get the tear gas gun. Shortly after getting the fourth hostage, there will be a convict shooting down at you from a building. He is the first window shooter in the game, shoot him with the Tear Gas gun and you will be 'rewarded' with a brief glimpse of a topless woman. This also occurs at other points in the game.

Joust (c) 1982 Williams.


AT SOME FAR-DISTANT TIME 2 fantastic gladiators meet and square off for battle. Each is mounted on a fanciful bird of prey (ostrich or stork) whose wings can carry it from the cliftops to the mouth of the abyss and hopefully back... or the bubbling lava below will increase it's toll.


While your mount is a skilled flyer, your opponent is a shrewd gladiator. You must prove you are his better. Stealthily you must pilot your mount above him, and cleverly you must stalk him... to strike at the moment he least suspects you! And always remember this rule : In every Joust, the highest lance wins!


Of course your opponent will resist your attempts, all the while pursuing his own designs on you. Each gladiator has five (operator-adjustable) mounts. Every time you're toppled you must mount a new bird for the next joust. The gladiator who scores the most dismountings is the winner.


YOUR PATH MAY SEEM CLEAR and your work cut out, but just them a flock of vicious Buzzard-Riders will ambush you! Ruthless even as they are dismounted, these wily Buzzard-Riders instantly lay their eggs. You must pick up the eggs or they will soon hatch into even more persistent and antagonistic foes!


Fortunately at 20,000 (operator-adjustable) points (should you make the grade) you will be awarded another bird to mount against the loyal opposition. Joust is designed for either one or two players.


The Joystick sends the gladiator and his ever stalwart mount (ostrich or stork) boldly to the left or to the right. The Flap Button causes the hero's mount to spread its robust wings.


- TECHNICAL -


* The upright version of Joust was a dedicated cabinet. It is similar in shape to other Williams games from that era, but it is not identical to them. The cabinet is largely black with no painted art on the front of the machine. But it does have sideart, in this case a four color painted rendering of a knight riding a large bird, while carrying a lance. This design is fairly simple when compared to the sideart on other games, and can be repainted by hand, as long as you are careful. The control panel, monitor bezel, and marquee are all filled with the expected graphics. The marquee especially is a stunning rendition of the Joust logo, and two riders inside the Joust world. Your Joust machine will come with either 2-Way leaf switch joysticks, or 2-Way optical ones. The early cabinets had the optical ones, while the later ones used the leaf stick ones. 


* The cocktail version (a cocktail game is a sit down table version), is notable because it was one of the most popular cocktail cabinets for conversion to newer titles. You see most cocktail tables originally held games that had monitors in a vertical orientation, and had a set of player controls on each end of the table. By 1985 no one was really making many vertical games, especially not ones that were one player at a time, and could flip the screen for the second player. But the Joust table was different. It had a horizontal monitor, and the players sat side by side, instead of at opposite ends of the table. This allowed the Joust cocktail cabinet to be used for all sorts of newer games. Electronically the cocktail version of Joust was identical to the upright version. The cocktail cabinet did not feature a lot of art, and was mostly black.


The Joust PCBs are functionally identical to those used in "Defender", "Robotron - 2084", "Bubbles", "Sinistar", and "Stargate", only the ROM chips are different.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your man will be at the entry point at the bottom of the playing field. From the other entry points, enemy riders will appear. It will then be up to you to successfully defeat them. Learning to flap your ostrich's wings is the most vital aspect of this game. How fast or slow you flap the wings determines speed and maneuverability. Once you get good, you will be able to glide around and only flap for either altitude or to hit an enemy rider.


* The name of the game is height. Whoever is the higher rider during a joust is the winner. If you and an enemy collide on the same level, the impact will knock you both backwards a little and turn you both around. This can prove to be dangerous if more then one enemy is coming for you since the first one turns you around and the second knocks you off your mount.


* You need to pay particular attention to the screen setup on each wave. Different platforms may collapse forcing you to readjust your strategy accordingly. Using the 20 wave example from Chapter 6.4, I will give you some basic strategies...

a) During the non-pterodactyl waves and platform one is intact, your best bet is to hang out under the right side of platform one. The enemy riders have to drop to get to you.  Just a quick press of the flap button should give you altitude over them and the easy kill.

b) If you lose platform one, the next best place is platform five. This forces the enemy riders to rise up to you. If you hover over the left or right edge, you can drop on enemy riders trying to rise up from the areas of platforms two and three. Of course, if any make it to your level, just sit on that entry point. When an enemy rider gets near, rapidly climb and move over toward the enemy to knock them off their mount.

c) When you only have platforms two and three, you will use a modified strategy from the one above. You will hover around the area that platform five was at. This forces the enemy riders to rise up to you, thereby exposing themselves to you dropping down on them.

d) If any of the above have Shadow Lords in them, you will have to be prepared to move around quickly since Shadow Lords are very fast and they tend to bounce off the top of the game screen.


* There are a couple of ways to kill off the pterodactyl during the pterodactyl waves :

1) First of all, you must be facing the pterodactyl in order to kill it.

2) If platform one still exists, then just wait for the pterodactyl and be ready for it to choke itself on your lance. If there are multiple pterodactyls, they usually come from opposite sides so the first one will have you turned around to meet the second one.

3) If platform one is gone, they use platform two to do your prehistoric hunting. If there are multiple pterodactyls, then you will have to move around until the second and subsequent pterodactyls are coming at your rider head on while you sit atop platform two.

4) If you are real good, you can kill the pterodactyls off in the air. You just have to make sure that your lance is evenly aligned with the pterodactyls mouth.

5) Pterodactyls also show up if you take too long on a wave. These can't be killed using the platform method. The only way is either in the air or to lose a man.

6) Some players take out all the enemy riders but one. Then they lead this rider toward the lave so the Lava Troll can grab them. The player then sits and hunts pterodactyls. This is a long process that is definitely loaded with peril.

7) If you get killed before killing the pterodactyl, it is very hard to get in position to kill the pterodactyl since it does involve a sort of rhythm. Also keep in mind that the enemy riders will still be trying to dismount you as you are hunting.


* The Pterodactyl Trick : Classic trick! Doesn't work on upgraded Joust machines, or on "Joust 2". Trick the last jouster on the stage to fly to the lava and get trapped by the lava troll. Then wait in the center of the middle platform. When a pterodactyl comes out, it'll fly right into your lance. The next part takes a fair amount of practice : When the pterodactyl has hit you, your character will be knocked back. Jiggle the joystick so that your mount is back in the middle of the ledge again. Keep doing this. Eventually there'll be a steady stream of pterodactyls and you'll be killing 'em about 2 per second, for 1000 points each. When you make a mistake and get killed, the trapped jouster will escape. On the last board in which this works (47), the jouster will not escape.


* The Lava Troll hazard isn't too major unless you fly too close to the surface of the lava. If you do happen to get grabbed, flap rapidly to escape.  It is also easy to hit enemies immobilized by the troll.


* After you hit an enemy rider, they become an egg. After a few seconds, the egg will hatch to the next hardest enemy rider. For example, a Bounder becomes a Hunter; a Hunter becomes a Shadow Lord. After that, it will always be a Shadow Lord. Some players leave one egg and then hover over it. When the enemy buzzard comes to pick up the rider, you knock him off the saddle again and collect the points. Again, the pterodactyl will show up soon to end this fun.


* Make sure you don't knock too many enemy riders off at once or there will be eggs scattered all over the place. This makes it hard to keep the enemy population down to a dull roar.


* Whenever your rider gets killed, he will appear at the entrance point all shimmery. If you let the sequence go, it will take up to five seconds for your rider to appear. During that time, he is immune to all attacks. Your rider will enter at the point there is the least amount of enemies. This is usually the very bottom platform. Keep in mind, the enemies also enter at these points.


* The game does reach a point where there are so many enemy riders running around, they are constantly bumping into one another. This, in effect, creates a wall which is very difficult and hazardous to navigate through. This means you have to split up the enemy


* If you die during a wave, try quickly to get your bearings so that you can get in position to continue depleting the enemy forces.


* The above tips are as valid for the two-player game as they are for the one-player game. In the two-player game, though, you and the other player can cover each other to make it more difficult for the enemy to knock you off your mounts.


* Phantom Energizer : In a two-player game (on a screen just before the middle ledge disappears) clear all opponents except 1. Kill him, leaving the egg in the middle of the bottom platform. Player 1 stands on the bottom energizer while player 2 jumps in the lava. If player 2 appears on the top energizer, then the trick will work. Player 1 then gets the egg. The 'phantom' ledge should remain.

Joust 2 - Survival of the Fittest (c) 12/1986 Williams.


On the planet of the floating cliffs, society calls upon its wing-mounted Gladiators to solve conflicts. You, the Gladiator, must enter the fray, participating in a challenge of honor, a JOUST... where only the fittest survive!


The legend of JOUST continues in JOUST 2. Players must solve the puzzle of what strategy will be most effective in dealing with the buzzards and other winged enemies on each of JOUST 2's thirty-five different backgrounds.


The object of JOUST 2 is to defeat all winged enemies by colliding with them. To survive a collision (Joust), the Gladiators lance must be higher.


Defeating a Buzzard Enemy in a Joust causes release of an Egg. Eggs may be caught in the air or collected on landing areas for bonus points. Be Careful! Eggs falling into the Lava form into aggressive mutants, while uncollected Eggs hatch into dangerous warriors.


Danger lurks everywhere! Giant Statues come to life; Bats fall out of crystals embedded in the rocks; Lava Trolls and Water Monsters eat unsuspecting bird-mounts; Lightning fills the air; and Unbeatable? Pterodactyls patrol the skies. A gigantic Knight presides on several waves. You, the Gladiator, must destroy him! Hitting all four of his red pins explodes the Knight and all his servants.


GOLD EGG FEATURE : A Gold Egg may randomly appear on any wave. Collecting the Gold Egg before it hatches opens a window of awards in the background. To collect an award, step on the red button above the window before a timer expires. Both players reap the benefits of the posted award, which may include bonuses of 1,000 to 10,000 points, 'super zapping' all enemies on the screen, or even receiving an extra life.


Prepare thyself for War!


BUY-IN : JOUST 2 is designed for action entertainment for one or two simultaneous players. Players who have started the game may continue where they left off by using the BUY-IN feature. When a player has used all of his lives, he will hear : WISH TO CONTINUE? A 10-second timer appears in the players score area to allow the game to continue by using a Credit, or inserting a coin, before the player presses the START button.


LEVEL SELECTION : At the beginning of a game, the player selects, via the FLAP button, one of six different waves, corresponding to the player's skill level. Then, pressing the START button begins the game. If the player wins the starting wave, he receives an award of points, approximating the scoring from preceding waves.


- TECHNICAL -


This game uses a redesign of the 'Williams Classic' platform. It is not compatible with the older titles, but they could possibly run on this platform with a little bit of tweaking. The game is contained on a set of two PCB boards, and a third board does audio duties. This title was released in an upright dedicated cabinet that was very similar in design to the original "Joust" cabinet (you would have to set them side by side to be able to spot the differences). It is decorated with stencil style painted side-art of a knight riding on a large bird (this was one of the last games to have stenciled side-art, stickers and other painting methods had been the norm for several years). The rest of the cabinet artwork is all based on the original "Joust" artwork, but has much more detail. The biggest difference between this cabinet and an original "Joust" cabinet is that this game uses a vertical monitor, rather than a horizontal one.

- TRIVIA -


The year was 1986 and the arcade industry was in a big slump, the golden age had been over for a few years, and the brief revival of the late 80s had not yet begun. Williams decided to do a sequel to their classic Joust title, and came up with Joust 2 - Survival Of The Fittest. This was a complete update to the original with new enemies and a variety of different levels, but it had one little flaw, it just simply was not as fun as the original. It was a great game on its own, but not when compared to "Joust". They only ended up making about 1000 of these, and most of them saw little action on the arcade floor. The players seemed to prefer the original "Joust" (which most arcades still had back then). Most of these machines ended up being pulled from the arcades after only a few months, and have survived to the present day in excellent conditions (It seems they were pulled for lack of profits, but most of them were not converted, because by 1986 most operators had a whole warehouse full of games to convert, and would usually select an older title rather than a new one that they could possibly sell off to someone else).


Dwayne Richard holds the official record for this game with 2,655,600 points.


A Joust 2 machine was shown at the 2003 classic arcade games show 'California Extreme' in San Jose, California.

Joyful Road (c) 1983 SNK.


A weird driving game with a car that has long arms that reach out to grab a variety of edible items that appear along roadside.


The object is to drive safely down the road. Pick up enough fuel to stay alive while avoiding other vehicles that go by, grab as many bonus objects as possible including apples, cherries, bananas, acorns, live fish and money, and park your car in the garage. Driving while trying to pick up the goodies is difficult and you can crash very easily on the narrow roads. The pace of the game is frustrating because the hands move slowly while the car itself moves really fast, especially in the later rounds. If one of your hands hits a tree or any other foreign object in its quest for food, the car winces in pain for a few moments until it can use its hands again.


You can get a bonus for putting used-up food into garbage cans. Grabbing fish which leap out of surrounding rivers is a safe bet, but most other bonuses are placed, so you can crash if you try to grab them. The best strategy is only to go for the fuel, since the car is a big gas guzzler and you can also get a bonus for leftover fuel at the end of the drive.

Jr. Pac-Man (c) 1983 Bally Midway.


One of many sequels to the legendary "Pac-Man", Jr. Pac-Man features the character of Pac-Man's son. For the first time in the series' history, side-scrolling mazes were introduced, with each maze being two screens wide.


This time, the mazes have no exit tunnels through which players can make an escape. The bonus items that appear move around the maze and are now something of a mixed blessing, as not only will they destroy any Power Pills they come across, but they will also turn any normal dots they pass over into large dots that slow the player's movements considerably, but are worth more points than normal dots if eaten by the player. Any mutated dots in the maze will disappear if the player loses a life.


The Pac-Man character is once again pursued by four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Tim) in his quest to eat all of the dots in each maze. And as before, numerous Power Pills litter the mazes that, when eaten, allow Jr. to eat the pursuing ghosts.


As with previous "Pac-Man" games, intermissions are featured between certain levels. Jr. Pac-Man's intermissions are episodic in nature, like those found in Ms. Pac-Man. Jr. Pac-Man's story tells of the blossoming love between a Pac-Man and a small ghost named Yum-Yum.


Act I - Jr. Meets Yum-Yum : Jr. Pac-Man steps outside his home to play. He spots Yum-Yum beyond the fence in his yard and goes outside to meet her. Blinky, hiding in the shadows, comes out from hiding to catch Jr. However Ms. Pac-Man, keeping a watchful eye over her child, sees the commotion from her window and runs out to the yard to eat a Power Pill and chase both ghosts away while Jr. returns to the safety of home. This intermission is played after Round 1.


Act II - The Gift : It seems that Jr. can't get the enchanting young ghost out of his mind, so he proceeds to bring a balloon to her as a gift the next day. Excited to see her, he meets her on a bridge and hands her the balloon, when we catch a glimpse of Blinky lurking behind a bush. This intermission is played after Round 3.


Act III - They Escape : Blinky moves from one bush to the another, startling Yum-Yum into releasing the balloon. Blinky attempts to capture Jr. once and for all, but once again, Ms. Pac-Man comes to the rescue. Blinky chases her off to the left, while Jr. Pac-Man and Yum-Yum escape to the right. Once alone, they gaze in to each other's eyes and fall in love, with hearts appearing all around them. This intermission is played after Rounds 5, 7, and 9.

- TRIVIA -


Released in October 1983.


Jr. Pac-Man was developed by 'General Computer Corporation' (GCC) for Bally/Midway and is essentially an enhancement to "Ms. Pac-Man" (which is, in itself, an enhanced version of the original "Pac-Man"). Much of the original "Pac-Man" code is still present and even the 'GENERAL COMPUTER CORPORATION Hello, Nakamura.' message that featured in "Ms. Pac-Man" is present.


Jr. Pac-Man runs on a modified "Pac-Man" hardware, with additional horizontal scrolling support. This was the first "Pac-Man" game in which the maze is larger than the visible area; requiring the screen to scroll.


There are a number of hidden bonus objects that were never used by the developers. To see them, set 'CHEATS' to 'Always have blue ghosts'; play a game, repeatedly eat the ghosts until you get past 1600 points. The game was coded to deal with such high bonus values and assigns a hexadecimal value to the score value after 1600. The hexadecimal scores equate to a graphic in the game. After eating somewhere in the neighborhood of 20-30 ghosts consecutively, the hidden objects will appear. There is a rattle, a baby's dummy, a cowboy hat and a skateboard.


Abner Ashman holds the official record for this game with 1, 500, 000 points on February 2, 2002. In the game where he "officially" got this record, there was a power outage that shut down his game at approximately that score... and he still had not lost a man up to that point!


A bootleg of this game runs on the "Pengo" hardware.


A Jr. Pac-Man unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


MAZE STRATEGY


The 1st maze, which has 548 dots and 6 Power Pills, offers a good mix of straight-a-ways and islands. The two power pills on either side of the ghosts' den cannot be destroyed by bonuses, so try to save them for later in the stage. The ghosts move slow enough that you can plan out your strategy and wait by power pills for ghosts to gather nearby before eating them. 


The 2nd maze has 560 dots, 6 Power Pills, and features more long stretches than the first maze, but there are many escape routes, so you shouldn't worry about getting trapped. Use the 'staircase' section of the maze on the far ends to put distance between you and any trailing ghosts. It's possible to 'trap' the ghosts so that you can complete a lot of the maze without them chasing you. Position Jr. to either the far left or far right hand side of the maze; thus causing the center of the maze to scroll off-screen. You should see the ghosts in the corridors above the ghosts' den; they will stay in those corridors as long as you are on either the left or right hand side of the maze. This works because the game has logic to reverse the ghosts' direction when they go off screen.


The 3rd maze has 526 dots, 6 Power Pills, and features small circular sections that you should approach with caution. It can be hard to read which directions the ghosts will move in around them and lead to unavoidable collisions. By this maze, the ghosts are speeding up, so take the time to cross from one section of the maze to the other to prevent the ghosts from surrounding you. 


The 4th maze has 526 dots and 6 Power Pills, and features islands on the bottom that can be both helpful and harmful. They allow you multiple paths to take in order to escape from one ghost, but they also provide multiple pathways for a number of ghosts to surround you. Clear as much of the bottom sections as you can before you eat the Power Pill. Then use the Pill and eat any ghost in the area before time runs out. Then finish the section if possible before moving on. 


The 5th maze has dots and 6 Power Pills, and features islands that are scattered throughout. Cross back and forth across the entire maze to prevent the ghosts from ganging up on you in any one section of the maze. Power pills are becoming less effective at this point. Don't sacrifice yourself trying to stop a bonus item from destroying a power pill. 


The 6th maze has many S-turns that offer the ghosts multiple opportunities to trap you from either end. Keep the ghosts behind you by crossing back and forth. To make matters worse, you only get 4 Power Pills instead of 6. Aside from the Power Pills, there are a total of 512 dots in this maze. Don't let the bonus item transform too many of the dots into mutated dots in this maze, or you will have a harder time avoiding ghosts while being slowed down by the large dots. 


The 7th and final maze is by far the most dangerous maze to Junior's survival. The center is relatively safe, but the sides of the maze are deadly. There are 540 dots and only 4 Power Pills in this maze. The Power Pills are situated in odd corners. The far path around the outside of the maze is considerably dangerous as it is easy to get trapped trying to clear it. And the Power Pills simply aren't effective long enough to keep you safe. The smaller sections between the side Power Pills is also easy to become trapped in. Only enter if the coast looks clear, and make sure that you have an exit strategy if a ghost decides to enter this small section with you. For all of your planning, success in this maze depends on a considerable amount of luck.


After you finish the 7th maze, the mazes cycle from the 4th through the 7th in a repeating loop.

Jungle Hunt (c) 1982 Taito.


A jungle adventure game with 4 challenging levels, each with its own unique scenarios; in which players take on the role of a colonial period jungle explorer who is going in search of a kidnapped girl. Jungle Hunt's game-play is very similar to that of Activision's "Pitfall", a classic arcade game released on many home computer and console formats of the time.


The game's levels are as follows :

* In the first level, players must use the JUMP button to move from right to left across a series of swinging vines; avoiding the monkeys that can send the explorer falling to the ground. This level is easy to master, but players must time their jumps carefully to make it to the next vine.

* The second level is a swimming sequence. Players must guide the explorer through crocodile infested water. This level features a 'breath meter' that must be carefully watched to avoid drowning (players simply swim up to the surface to get more air). The professor is armed with a knife with which he can stab the crocodiles, but this can only be done when their mouths are not fully open.

* The third level is a rock jumping sequence. Player simply use the JUMP button to leap over rolling boulders as they climb a hill to reach the end of the level.

* The fourth and final level has players guiding the explorer through a native village. The explorer must jump the villagers while their spears are down, and eventually make their way towards the unnamed girl who is being lowered into a pot to be boiled for supper.


On completion of the game, players are rewarded with an 'I Love You' ending, and the game begins again with increased difficulty.


- TECHNICAL -


Jungle Hunt used the familiar 'Taito Classic' cabinet which was used for a variety of early 1980's games. This was a short cabinet, and had a monitor that was laid back at more than a 45 degree angle. Most of these cabinets featured the same painted side-art which consisted of an ornate border and a 'Taito' logo. Many other early Taito games will plug right into your Jungle Hunt machine without modification (although the board-sets for these early games tend to be expensive). The marquee to this title showed a 'Jungle Hunt' logo, surrounded by a couple of green lines (there were produced very quickly, and cannot compare to the Jungle King marquee). The monitor bezel was decorated with a green design, while the control panel overlay also had a few green line graphics. All in all, this machine was not nearly as attractive as the "Jungle King" one was, probably due to the fact that Taito rushed this one out the door in a few weeks.

Released in October 1982. This was the first 'side-scrolling, jumping & attacking game', appearing in arcades 3 years before Miyamoto's classic "Super Mario Bros".


Michael Torcello holds the official record for this game with 1,510,220 points.


The original Japanese game known as "Jungle King" features a character who looked like the well known (and very much copyrighted) Tarzan. The character even sounded like Tarzan when he bellowed out the famous scream after finishing the boulder stage (and at the beginning of the game). So, for legal reasons, the name was changed to 'Jungle Hunt' and the character was changed to resemble a classic jungle explorer complete with the standard issue pith helmet and shorts. The bellowed scream at the end of the boulder stage was also entirely removed.


A reworked version of this game is known as "Pirate Pete".


A Jungle Hunt unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames'.


MB (Milton Bradley) released a board-game based on this video-game (same name) in 1983.


- UPDATES -


Instead of "Jungle King", Jungle Hunt has :

* An opening musical theme is played at certain parts of the game instead of the opening Tarzan yell - the same music that plays at the end of the swimming sequence.

* The life-lines he swings on between the trees in the forest are ropes instead of vines.

* The player character is a jungle explorer clad in a pith-helmet and safari jacket instead of the Tarzan character.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Swinging :

1) The main thing to remember on this screen is timing. Some vines swing faster then others. As you go farther into the game, the vines will really start to swing fast so you must be able to time your jumps accordingly.

2) The best place to catch a vine is in the middle or lower (ideally the bottom of the vine is the best). This way, you give yourself enough jumping room to get to the next vine.

3) Don't just start jumping to the vines without looking. If a vine is moving away from you, wait until it's halfway to you, then jump.

4) At the later levels, monkeys will appear on the vines. Try to catch a vine and hit the monkey, you will be on the ground.


* Swimming :

1) On this screen, you will swimming through a jungle river. Things to remember are to keep track of your Diving Display. If the bar goes all the way to the left, your man will become a floater. Go up every now and then for a breath of air.

2) The biggest hazards are the crocodiles. Fortunately, you have your trusty knife with you. Now, in order to kill the crocodiles, their mouths have to be closed. If they aren't, you will become free food. Also, if you hit any part of the crocodile, you will die.

3) Another hazard is the air bubbles. If you happen to swim into them, they will push you immediately to the surface regardless of what hazards may be in your way. The best way to work around this is vary your man's speed by moving the joystick left and right and time it so that there are no hazards above the air bubbles.


* Avalanche : This is probably the easiest screen. All you have to do is jump the small boulders and duck under the big ones. If a small boulder is really bouncing, you can run under it. This is a pretty straightforward level.


* Natives : Probably the hardest screen because you have to time your jumps in between the two natives...

1) Get right next to the first native. Keep in mind, you can only jump when their spears aren't in the air or you will be skewered.

2) Also, watch your woman on the vine. It also is going up and down so you have to time your jumps for both the natives and your woman.

3) Another thing that occurs is that the natives get close together, then spread out again.

4) Now, you have to jump between the natives, then jump up when your woman is at the lowest point on the vine.  This will require timing and there is no pattern or trick. Just keep in mind that if you can't get to her, jump back to your original position or the second native will get you.

5) On the later levels, everything moves much quicker.

Jungle King (c) 1982 Taito.


Jungle King has 4 levels, each of which could be considered a separate game in their own right. It is notable that this game scrolls right to left, while the vast majority of scrollers go from left to right, although most people probably wouldn't even notice that.

* The first level may have been the best level in the game. You use your jump button to move from right to left across a series of swinging ropes, while avoiding the monkeys that can send you falling to the ground. This level is easy to master, but you do have to time your jumps to make it to the next vine.

* The second level is a swimming sequence. You move Tarzan around in the crocodile infested water. You have a breath meter here that you must watch to avoid drowning (simply swim up to the surface to get more air). You can stab the crocodiles with your knife, but only when their mouths are not all the way open.

* The third level is a rock jumping sequence. Simply use your joystick and jump button to leap over rolling boulders as you climb a hill on the way to your eventual goal.

* The fourth and final level has you guiding your intrepid hero through a native village. You have to jump the villagers while their spears are down, and eventually make your way towards Jane who is being lowered into a pot to be boiled for supper.


You then get to view a short 'I Love You' ending, and then the game begins again with increased difficulty.

Released in August 1982.


It was the first 'side-scrolling, jumping & attacking game with a humanoid character', appearing in arcades three years before Miyamoto's classic "Super Mario Bros.". This was also the first video game ever to feature Tarzan as a playable character. But, Taito never bothered to get permission from the estate of Edgar Rice Burroughs, so they were sued for copyright infringement for using Tarzan's likeness. So this title quickly went out of production, and is rather rare today. They later reworked the graphics and released this game as "Jungle Hunt".


A prototype of this game is known as "Jungle Boy".


A reworked version of this game is known as "Pirate Pete".

- TRIVIA -


Released in June 1994.


The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Jong God Legend'.


Janshin Densetsu appears to be a complete ripoff of 1991's "Mahjong Quest" by Taito. The basic premise is the same : a girl in an RPG-style format walking along a world map and encountering enemies which are battled through mahjong matches. The enemy encounter screens have identical borders and the enemies are drawn in the same comic-anime style. Before each mahjong match, there are selectable spells that can be bought with stored MP, the screen and spells being identical in both cases. The player also has a Sword and Shield which can be activated during a match which give the player special abilities. The in-game text is virtually identical. The mahjong tiles themselves look almost exactly the same save for the backs; the mahjong game screen itself is almost exactly the same. Even upon defeating an enemy, they are turned into a scantily-clad woman as does your character when she is defeated. The only major difference between the two seems to be that "Mahjong Quest" is controlled with a mahjong control panel and Jyanshin Densetsu is controlled with the MVS Neo-Geo joystick. The next Aicom game on SNK Neo-Geo MVS is 1995's "Pulstar", shares lots of similarities with "R-Type" as well.

Kamikaze (c) 1980 Leijac.


Kamikaze is a simple two-dimensional shooter. You control your laser base against an endless stream of alien invaders. The invaders don't come in set waves. Instead, they come in a constant stream. Once you have gotten through one barrage of aliens, more are just behind to continue the action. Your job is to keep them from overwhelming you with their superiority in numbers. Kill or be killed, that is the objective.


Kamikaze is one of the follow-up games that rode on the wave of the "Space Invaders" craze. The game itself is simple in concept but the action gets fast paced real quickly. Especially since several things can be going on at the same time during the game.

This game is also known as "Astro Invader" (Stern).


Although all the screen colors are generated by the game's hardware as opposed to a screen overlay, there are varying bands of color dependent upon where the aliens are displayed vertically. At different heights, the aliens and their saucers are displayed in various colors. When a player's ship is destroyed, the entire display is drawn in red.


- SCORING -


Alien spacecraft, not moving, in their stalls : 10 points

Alien spacecraft moving into stalls or dropping toward you : 20 points

UFO : 100, 200, 300, or 400 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your base will be in the middle, at the bottom of the screen in the area in between the stalls. When the game starts, a large UFO will enter the top of the screen. It will have the number 200 in it. That is how many alien spacecraft that 'mother' ship is going to attack you with. The 'mother' ship will land on the platform and the game will commence or continue. When the 'mother' ship expends all 200 of its ships, all gameplay freezes and a new 'mother' ship will enter with 200 more alien spacecraft. This cycle will keep going until you lose all of your bases.


* A stall will hold 4 invaders. If you haven't reduced that number down, the 5th invader on will drop to the ground.  When an invader hits the ground, it just doesn't hit, it produces a blast radius a little wider then the stall it fell from. Your laser base can be destroyed by this 'indirect' fire.


* Just as deadly are the UFO's that show up. They can appear out of any of the open areas (as denoted in the playing field). They don't shoot or look threatening. The problem is, when they land on the ground, your base will be destroyed.


* The ''mother'' ship starts to distribute invaders starting with stall number 1 and works from left to right. Then it works from right to left and so on. The pattern is like this:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2...  As you can see, the right side will fill up quicker if you don't act quickly. This only works on odd numbered boards. On the even numbered boards, the 'mother' ship will stack the invaders on the same side as your laser base.


* The best strategy for this game is to keep the middle as open as possible. Keep stalls 4, 5, 6, and 7 as cleared of invaders as possible. Prevent these stalls from building up their maximum of 4 invaders. This will give you some breathing room plus it will help when dealing with the UFO's that come down on the left or right sides.


* There is a pattern on how the invaders are distributed. Use this knowledge when you are moving along the bottom of the screen. If you have stalls topped off and invaders are dropping, watch which way the 'mother' ship is distributing the aliens. If it is from right to left, then the aliens will fall from the farthest stall away from you and come inward. If it is from left to right, then the invaders will fall away from you. This is good if you are trying to make it to one side or the other to know how the invaders are falling.


* You can shoot the aliens that are falling but keep in mind, there probably is another that is on the left or right side that will hit the ground. Given that the blast radius is wider then the stall, it's better to let it go. Just keep the stalls (especially 4, 5, 6, and 7) cleared as best as possible.


* When the 'mother' ship is down to its last few invaders, make sure you are not in a position to get blasted the moment the new 'mother' ship arrives to continue the action. Nothing like having an falling invader inches from your laser base and the action pauses only to unpause and you get your base destroyed.


* Although the UFO seems to come out at random times and places, there does appear to be a pattern. It seems to come down the center mostly but it also has a pattern as to when it comes down the right and left sides.

Kangaroo (c) 1982 Sun Electronics.


A platform game in which the player controls a mother Kangaroo who must climb through the treetops trying to rescue her captured son. Numerous monkeys, the kidnappers of her child, roam the levels set on stopping the player's progress. The monkeys constantly throw apples at the Kangaroo which must either be avoided (either by ducking or jumping, depending on the height of the approaching apple), or punched away, the latter of which allows the Kangaroo to punch the apple back towards the attacking monkey.


If the player stalls for too long or does not punch either an apple or a monkey, a giant ape will appear and steal the Kangaroo's boxing gloves, leaving the player temporarily defenseless. The gloves are returned after a short time.


Fruit and vegetables litter the levels and can be picked up for bonus points. Each level also has a bell hanging from one of its platforms, which can be punched to make fruit and vegetable items appear. The game consists of 4 different stages, once these are completed the game begins again with an increased level of difficulty.

Karate Blazers (c) 1991 Video System.


A horizontally scrolling fighting game for 1 to 4 players. Each playable character (chosen from Mark, Glen, Akira and Gil) kicks and punches their way through a number of enemy-packed levels. In addition to kicking and puching, each character also has their own unique 'special attack'; a move that injures multiple on-screen enemies at the cost of some of the player's health.


While in no way original (drawing most of its inspiration from Capcom's "Final Fight"), Karate Blazers is both hugely playable and very fast and frenetic, with the amount of on-screen enemies at times overwhelming. The graphics are also well drawn and nicely animated.

The only description that can truly do this game justice is seminal.

A Karate Champ machine was shown at the 2003 classic arcade games show 'California Extreme' in San Jose, California.

This game is known in Japan as "Karate Dou", the Vs version is known in Japan as "Taisen Karate Dou - Seishun Bishoujo Hen".


- UPDATES -


The US 'Versus' (2-player) version shipped one month later in October 1984. The Versus version, however, differs slightly from its single-player sibling. There is a greater variation in backgrounds, for example, with a variety of outdoor locations as opposed to the standard Martial Art dojos of the earlier version. The sound effects also seem to be a little 'sharper', with the speech, in particular, much improved.

Karnov (c) 1987 Data East.


Karnov is a 2-D, platform style game. You control Karnov through 9 scenes. Each of these scenes gives you piece of a map (except the first scene). Get all the pieces of the map and you get to the treasure. Your journey won't be easy though. You will be going through some rough environment such as towns, forests, oceans, and caves. To further make your travels a hazard, different enemies attempt to end Karnov's life prematurely and prevent him from getting to the treasure. To aid Karnov in his adventures, he has certain items that he can draw from his inventory. In addition, there are other items that can make Karnov a potent foe of those wishing to harm him. You must complete each scene in order to advance to the next scene. All in a days work of a hearty explorer.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* The Bosses : There are six different bosses you have to deal with in this game. Some of the scenes will reuse these bosses again. Sometimes you will even get more then one of the same kind of boss to tangle with either at the end of a scene or somewhere within the scene (this is especially true in the later scenes). Listed below are the bosses and a couple of tactics that you can use to defeat them. It is best to have your full firepower to tangle with these bosses instead of just using your pathetic one shot.


MERMAN : His mode of attack is to throw water balls at you and jump around. He is one of the easier bosses to deal with.

1) When he enters the screen, start firing on him. If your shot power is enhanced, you may be able to take him out before he has a chance to attack.

2) If you don't take him out when he enters, be prepared to jump because he will throw a water ball at your character.

3) Continue to jump back and forth. Fire on him when you land and you should take care of him quickly.


TRAINER AND LIONS : This boss comes on the screen as a man holding two lions on a leash. The lions

spit fire in addition to a claw attack.

1) The first thing you don't want to do is take out the trainer first. If you do, the two lions will immediately attack.

2) Go to the left side, duck, and start hacking away at the lions. It will take several shots to take one of the lions down.

3) When the trainer and lions get about three-quarters of the way across the screen, jump over them and repeat the above from the right side.

4) Once the lions are taken care of, take out the trainer. Again, watch out for the fireballs.


SCORPION WOMAN : She's big and she's bad. She will usually come crawling down a wall to do battle with Karnov. She likes to spit a massive barrage of fire at Karnov.

1) You must hit the Scorpion Woman in her torso, hitting her body won't hurt her.

2) Every time you score a hit, she will rear up and let loose with a barrage of fire.

3) Jump around the screen and jump over her to avoid her fire. Make sure that when you jump, she isn't reared up or you will be killed.

4) She tends to lay a pattern of fire from top to bottom. Remember this when you are jumping so you don't jump into her line of fire.

5) Continue to jump around her and fire and you should have this bug squashed in no time.


TYRANNOSAURUS REX : This big old dinosaur is not only very large, it also has a very nasty breath

weapon. Because he is so tall, it makes it even more of a challenge to hit his head (which you must do to kill him).

1) When the Tyrannosaurus Rex (T-Rex) first enters the area, jump straight up and sent a heavy volume of fire his way. He will flash when hits are scored.

2) The T-Rex is pretty quick so don't get yourself caught in a corner. The T-Rex will either barbeque or just stomp on Karnov. Jumping around is the key to avoid this problem.

3) Try to jump to the far sides (left or right) so that you can get at least a couple of shots off when you jump vertically. The T-Rex will usually almost be on Karnov after the second volley.

4) Continue to maneuver around and you will have dinosaur steaks for dinner.


TWO-HEADED DRAGON : Besides the wizard, this is one of the most brutal bosses. His breath weapon is very nasty and so is his bite. The breath weapon can get Karnov in two ways. The first way is a direct hit. The other way is when it explodes against some object. Fragments will explode outwards and could hit Karnov.

1) This will require you to do some very fancy maneuvering. The dragon is slow but it more then makes up for that in offensive capabilities.

2) When the dragon fires on Karnov, watch where the shot fragments go. You must hit the heads to kill this dragon off. The best way might be to find a ledge to take shots at it.

3) You will only have time for one shot before you have to move since the dragon's firepower covers such a broad area.

4) Again, jump around and make your shots count. Eventually you will add some dragon heads to your collection.


WIZARD : You will only encounter this boss once since he is the final boss. He has a nasty offensive spell and a couple of good defensive moves. The bad part of this boss is that when you enter his area, you lose all your inventory items and power-ups.

1) Right before you enter the Wizard's area, equip the Jump/Running Shoes and Boomerang. Then enter his area.

2) You will see three ledges (one high and two low). The Wizard maneuvers around these ledges and fires out a ring of stars. These can be tricky to avoid but it can be done.

3) Instead, when the Wizard appears on one of the two lower ledges, fire the boomerang at him. Depending on whether the machine is set to easy or hard will determine whether the boomerang kills him or not. If it doesn't, a few more shots should finish him off.

4) If you don't have the boomerang, be prepared for a very long fight. You must concentrate on avoiding his fire while getting shots in on him. This means constantly moving around.

5) It will take a lot of shots to bring him down and end his magical days.


* Below are some basic strategies for getting through the game...

1) You will have 200 seconds to get through each scene. This means you must plan for good time management in order to have enough time to deal with the scene bosses.

2) Remember, you can move in eight directions on the screen. Use this to your advantage to avoid an enemy's fire while taking them down at the same time.

3) There are a lot of items that are hidden from your view (either because they are too high or because they are truly hidden). Use the Ladder and Mask at all times to get the most amount of items you can.

4) Some areas have alternate routes. This means you will have to decide beforehand since you won't be able to backtrack to go on another path.

5) The game scrolls along with the character which means that once you have passed an area, you cannot return to it again.

6) Try to jump instead of walk. The reason is that sometimes items fall from the sky or ceiling making it that much easier to collect them.

7) If you take too long in a part of the scene, indestructible seeds will fall from the top of the screen. Once they hit the ground, they become indestructible flowers that shoot fire. To avoid this, move through each scene quickly.


* SCENE 1 : This is  one of the easier levels to introduce you to the game.

1) You start off on a platformed area. Immediately collect the Ladder and move to the right.

2) Green-Hooded Creatures will attack Karnov. Once disposed of, use the Ladder to collect the Bomb.

3) You will then encounter a Gray Rock Golem atop a rock. The Gray Rock Golem will throw a rock every two seconds. You can destroy the rock but you get no points. Once you take out the golem, jump on the area he was and use the Ladder to retrieve the Super Fireball and Jump/Running Shoes (you can get the shoes by jumping in the same area since they will fall to the ground).

4) Some more Green-Hooded Creatures will attack.

5) You will see a Gargoyle in a tree. Behind it will be a Orange Sphere. Take out the Gargoyle and retrieve the sphere.

6) Ostrich Riders will attack. After you dispose of them, use the Ladder to retrieve the three K's midway on the first building.

7) Before the stairs, you will have to tangle with a Brown Rock Golem. The Brown Rock Golem will throw rocks any time you hit it. Again, rocks get you no points.

8) When you get to the stairs, you will be assaulted by Large Flying Demons and a couple of Ostrich Riders.

9) Knights will attack when you get to the top of the steps. After you dispose of them, use your Ladder to get two Bombs.

10) About three-quarters of the way across the bridge you will be attacked by Small Flying Demons.

11) Another Gray Rock Golem awaits you on the bridge. Behind it will be a Brown Rock Golem.

12) After you go down the stairs, you will be attacked by a Gargoyle, Small Flying Demons, and Knights.  After you have made it through them, jumping will get you a set of Jump/Running Shoes.

13) You will be attacked by some more Ostrich Riders before you have to encounter the boss.

14) Boss battle against the MERMAN.


* SCENE 2 : You get to navigate through some ancient ruins in this scene.  The big threats are the Statues and Gold Men.

1) This level starts you off by going through the Statues. They are five columns high with a head that spits fire. After the third Statue, use the Ladder to get the Wings and Super Fireball.

2) After you deal with the fourth Statue, you will have to deal with the Gray Rock Golem.

3) You will next be attacked by Eagles and Large Flying Demons.  Then the Small Flying Demons will attack. After you take care of them, use your Ladder to get five K's.

4) More Large Flying Demons block your path as you head up the mountain.

5) At the area where a ladder goes up, you will encounter a short Statue three columns high with a head spitting fire.

6) At the top of the mountain is a Gold Statue. It attacks by shooting a spread of fire in Karnov's direction. It cannot be hit when it is firing.

7) After another round of Large Flying Demons, you have to deal with another Gold Statue.

8) Knights and Small Flying Demons make this next part challenging. After you are done, use the Ladder to collect three Bombs, a Mask, Super Fireball, and three K's.

9) Boss battle against the TRAINER AND LIONS.


* SCENE 3 : This next scene takes you through a battered forest. There are a lot of chasms

in the ground. In addition, you will navigating through some caves.

1) Collect the Super Fireball and move right. You will see a Gargoyle with a Orange Sphere behind it. After you defeat it, collect the sphere and use the Ladder to collect the Diving Helmet, Run/Jumping Shoes, and five K's. Use a bomb at the base of the tree to knock it down and make a bridge.

2) When you cross over, a Spirit will release from the tree. Sometimes a Red Serpent will also attack.

3) You will then have to jump over two chasms while being attack by Eagles. After that attack, you will have to jump over a third chasm. After the third chasm, use you Ladder to collect three Bombs.

4) You will then see some mounds of dirt. The object is to jump from the top of one to the other. If you fall in the gap, you will be attacked by a Small Earth Elemental.

5) Remember that Boss Merman you battled before. Well, he's back again for another rematch.  Take care of him again.

6) After the fish fry, you will encounter a Brown, then Gray Golem. Continuing on, you will be attacked by Small Flying Demons and another Brown Rock Golem. Use the Ladder after this to collect the Super Fireball and three K's.

7) You will go through a Brown Rock Golem and Small Flying Demons. After this, use the Ladder to get another five K's.

8) Eagles will attack setting the stage for the next boss battle.

9) Boss battle against the TYRANNOSAURUS REX.


* SCENE 4 : This scene has you going through a cave. You won't be able to jump around as much in here due to the fact of all the chasms and small areas.

1) When you enter the cave, you can equip your Mask to see more things to get. You can collect four K's, a Mask, Ladder, and two Bombs.

2) Continuing onward, you must now navigate through some volcanoes. There are five in the ceiling and four on the ground. If you crouch next to the volcanoes on the ground, the lava bombs can't hit you. Time it so you can safely navigate through this area.

3) After getting through the volcanoes, you will encounter some conveyor belts. The first one rotates to the left so be careful when you jump on it.

4) Jump to the next conveyor belt which is rotating to the right. Turn left and jump on that one which is rotating left again. Climb the ladder and you will enter a cave with twelve K's.

5) When you exit the cave, a Brown Rock Golem awaits. Clear him out and jump. You will either hit the second conveyor belt you jumped on or a rocky ledge. Either way, make sure you are on the rocky ledge that has the K on it.

6) Bats will attack as you move up these ledges with K's on them.

7) At the end of the ledge is a platform. If you go to the end of the platform, the boss awaits.

8) Drop down off the ledges to floor level and the boss battle with the SCORPION WOMAN will occur.


* SCENE 5 : This scene takes you underwater. There are a couple of islands with things on them but the primary part is still underwater. This is also a short scene.

1) Karnov starts from the cliff. Hopefully you managed to get the Diving Helmet. If not, your game will be finished very quickly.

2) Right at the bottom where Karnov enters the water, there is a stack of K's. The big enemies to watch out for in this area are the Seaweed and Clams.

3) When you get to the first island, get onto it. You will have to deal with the Boss MERMAN again (doesn't he ever give up?). Anyway, after dealing with him, get the three Bombs, Diving Helmet, Mask, Run/Jumping Shoes, and the Orange Sphere. Then go back into the water.

4) If you choose to go under the island, you can go into the little cave to collect the K's. The Sea Warriors and Small Merman will be on the attack.

5) This second part of the swimming has you going against Sea Warriors and Small Merman. Just watch out for the Sea Warriors because they like to throw their spears down in addition to sideways.

6) When you climb up on the next island, you will have to deal with the boss.

7) The boss battle has you against a TYRANNOSAURUS REX again but this isn't the only one. You will have to defeat a second TYRANNOSAURUS REX to finish this scene.


* SCENE 6 : This scene will keep you very busy. There are a lot of enemies and very few items to collect.

1) You will be immediately attacked by Knights and Large Flying Demons. After you clear them out, Eagles and Green-Hooded Creatures will attack.

2) After the Green-Hooded Creatures attack, use the Ladder to collect the Wings.

3) You will now have to battle two Boss MERMAN. After you take them out, Large Flying Demons will attack.

4) You will need to climb up this building then go across. You will attacked by more Large Flying Demons.

5) When you come down on the other side, you will be attacked by the TRAINER AND LIONS.

6) You will climb again and on the path with be 14 Exploding Owls. Exploding Owls are so named that when you hit them, they explode throwing shrapnel all over. Jump to avoid.

7) After the owls, prepare for the boss.

8) You will have to tangle with two SCORPION WOMAN to finish this scene.


* SCENE 7 : This is a short level. There are a few treasures for the taking. The enemies aren't as bad as in scene 6 but there are still a lot of them.

1) You first will be attacked by a group of Greek Fighters along with Eagles.

2) You next will need to navigate through the Large Statues. There are a total of five to navigate through.

3) Next you will need to climb the pyramid. When you get to the first level with a doorway, use a bomb to blow the door open.

4) Go in and you will be attacked by more Greek Fighters. Go up the incline and prepare for a boss.

5) This battle involves the TWO-HEADED DRAGON.

6) After clearing out the dragon, continue to the right and jump the gap. Climb up to the top platform.  A mummy will attack. Mummies are tough creatures that turn into a tombstone every time they are hit. They can take a lot of punishment.

7) Once you take out the mummy, go all the way to the right and a platform will extend.

8) Go back left and prepare for the next boss before dropping into the hole.

9) When you drop into the hole, you will be up close and personal with a TYRANNOSAURUS REX. Finish him off and head up the steps.

10) Be very careful on this part, there are boulder traps for each step so either jump back or destroy them with firepower.

11) Collect the fourteen K's and finish climbing. At the top of the steps, bats will attack.

12) After that, another boss battle with another TWO-HEADED DRAGON will finish the scene.


* SCENE 8 : Another scene where things will be tough. You will be dealing with the spirits on this scene.

1) Knights will attack you along with Small Flying Demons.

2) You will then be attacked by a Spirit and further beyond, two Large Statues also firing on Karnov.

3) A group of Green Monkeys will attack. After they attack, use the Ladder to get another Ladder and Run/Jumping Shoes.

4) Tree Spirits will descend to do battle with Karnov along with a Spirit. Collect the four K's.

5) Large Flying Demons and more Tree Spirits will attack. After that, Small Flying Demons will get in their licks.  Collect the four K's.

6) The boss battle will be another TYRANNOSAURUS REX to finish off the scene.


* SCENE 9 : This is the last scene to be completed. This area is very tough and you will be hard pressed in the time department to finish it. Don't get involved in all the little battles. Get to the Wizard as quickly as possible.

1) Use your Ladder to collect the two Bombs, Run/Jump Shoes, Super Fireball, Mask, and a Ladder.

2) You will then be attacked by Knights and Large Flying Demons until you get to the platform areas. Then Bats will make a brief appearance.

3) When you get to the platforms, don't go up. Instead, jump the chasm to the right. You will be attacked by a Boss MERMAN. Although space is tight, you should take him out.

4) You will also notice that Small Earth Elementals are spilling over the ledges. This is the desired effect so you don't have to deal with them up top.

5) Now, go back to the right and climb the platforms. At the top of the second platform, Small Flying Demons may attack.

6) Go to the right to the next ledge. Use heavy firepower to hit the large mounds of dirt. These will change into Large Earth Elementals. There are three of them.

7) Keep going right. At the end of the ledge, jump to the right. You will land on another ledge.  If you just drop, you will land in a pit with a lot of mummies.

8) Take care of the two mummies from the ledge and look to the right. You will see two SCORPION WOMAN. Don't worry about them right now, just avoid their fire.

9) Climb up the two sets of ladders and head right.  At the end of the ledge, drop off. You will see a wall to the right. Fire on it and the wall opens up. Before going in, power yourself up.

10) Enter this area for the last boss fight with the WIZARD.

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Captain Commando : G.S.M. Capcom 5 - PCCB-00083) on 21/03/1992.


- UPDATES -


Here is a list of features found only in the Japanese (08/1991) and US version (09/1991) :

* A weaver effect of character sprites at the beginning of characters selection screen.

* A different sound effect is used when a character gains a level-up, enters a stage or rises again.

* More difficult (more enemies).

* Enemies appearance is very different from the original 'World version' of the game (07/1991).

* Cleric is less powerful than in the 'World version'. It starts with 40 Health Point instead of 48.

* The first extra live is at 200k points instead of 100k.

* Time runs faster when the 'GO cursor' is flashing.

* Count down of time starts from 30 seconds when a life is lost. This happens every time a character is killed by enemies while remaining time is less than 30 seconds.

* Fruit restores only 12 Health Point (banana 10 Health Point, big red apple 24) instead of 16 in 'World version'.

* A dead Boss restores only 12 Health Point instead of 16 in 'World version'.

* Magic attacks and magic crystals destroy directly enemies flying objects (so you get more experience points). These are wolves archers arrows, skeletons lances and knights archers arrows.

* Mimic Chests release a pool of acid after breaking them.

* New enemies like green lizard spearmen and dark red lizard swordsmen.

* Player doesn't gain the extra strawberry after the killing of the Orc King (the Boss of the first stage).

* The gait of the Wyvern (the Boss of the third and of the fourteenth stage) is different; it has also only triple fireball/iceball attacks.

* Back attacks of the Hydra (the Boss of the fourth stage) are more powerful.

* Additional green apple no more available on the five stage.

* Frontal punch attack of the Cyclops (the Boss of the sixth and fifteenth stage) is faster than in the 'World version'.

* New different background music in the last duel with evil red dragon Gildiss.

* A new Gildiss attack : an animated breath of flame after he changes the direction he's facing during the battle.

* Added a new credit sequence (read the staff) with Gildiss and beauty fairy.


ADDITIONAL NOTES : The US version is slightly different, it has the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Strange Item :

Ice Star : sometimes in 2P mode at second stage, an ice star appears after breaking the wood cask. It seems it only restores energy like a fruit.  

Gold Gauntlet : sometimes at fourth stage, a gold gauntlet appears after breaking the second-last chest. It seems useless. 

Cutpurse's Sack : it's a small sack with a light blue question mark that is dropped by Cutpurses after they get hit during the game. A hidden trick or simply a Capcom's joke? 


* Gaining extra points :

1) Eat a fruit or a elixir at full energy: this gives 5000 experience points.

2) Hit flying objects like wolves archers arrows, skeletons lances and knights archers arrows.

3) Hit Cutpurse : they take away items like gold's sacks, rubys, pearls, gems, diamonds and fruits.

4) Kill all the green lizard spearmen during the battle with the Wyvern at fourteenth stage (they can release a lot of diamonds or precious).

5) Hit Gildiss fireballs : some of these turns into green apples that at full full energy gives 5000 experience points each-one.

6) Don't use magic attacks or magic crystals at bosses : these kinds of attacks are incredibly more powerful than normal attacks so a boss needs many less hits to kill him.


* BOSSES and POWER-UP WEAPON STRATEGY : middle or end level bosses give experience points for each hit taken while normal monsters give experience points ONLY when they die (it has no matter how strong is the attack, they give ALWAYS the same experience points). 

- With Elf, Fighter, Cleric and Dwarf : DON'T power-up your weapon during the game and ALWAYS use the LEVEL-1 WEAPON. So a boss needs many more hits to kill him (remember? more hits > more experience points). To gain extra point it has no matter if character power-up or not bow (for Elf) or shield (for Fighter, Cleric and Dwarf).

- With Wizard : DON'T power-up your weapon during the game and use the LEVEL-1 WEAPON until the wizard can take the LEVEL-5 WEAPON (a wood staff with metal headpiece and red gem/orange flame). This weapon isn't much powerful but a singular attack to a boss increases three times the experience points for each hit. 


* INFINITE WOLVES ARCHERS TRICK : at the beginning of the sixth stage on the beach, don't go forward but wait. After few seconds a blue wolf archer appears and after you kill him, another appears then another one in sequence (then two wolves at a time, then three at a time and then four at a time) to infinity. One single wolf is equal to 1300 experience points, so player can accumulate points and win a life every 450k points. If player wants to squeeze millions of point it has to kill wolves fastly and win a life before the time marks 0 then after he rises again with a new life, he starts again to kill wolves and repeats the same method.

- In the 'World version' : time doesn't run faster when the 'GO cursor' is flashing, so player can kill wolves without go forward (but he isn't forced to do it). 

- In the 'Japan/US version' : time run faster when the 'GO cursor' is flashing, so player is forced to go forward step by step, kill a pair of wolves and before the next 'GO cursor' is flashing once, go forward step by step again (this method is very hard).


ADDITIONAL NOTES : Each character has a maximum of 24 level-up during all the game. This means a full bar of energy with 96 Health Point.

- TRIVIA -


Released in August 1994.


The King of Fighters (or KOF for short) revolutionized the fighter genre with the introduction of 3 member team fighting called the 'team battle system', and by combining elements of two of SNK's existing fighting game in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" and "Art of Fighting", as well as bringing back characters from games predating the MVS in "Ikari Warriors" and "Psycho Soldier". A new game in the series is produced every year.


At the demo previous to the first Rugal encounter, Rugal shows your team the statues he has gathered by turning his opponents into them. One of the statues is of a guy that looks a lot like Capcom's Guile making a Sonic Boom. Capcom later confirmed that it was indeed Guile's statue in "Capcom Vs. SNK - Millenium Fight 2000". When Guile fights Rugal that statue is shown and later destroyed by Guile.


Kyo Kusanagi : Since Kyo was created as a snazzy character capable of holding his own against the main characters of "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" and "Art of Fighting", coming up with the right design was quite a lengthy undertaking. Kyo's personality remained a mystery until the final stages of development. Originally, he was to be called 'Sho Kirishima', but during the latter stages of development, his designers decided on the name of Kyo Kusanagi, and Sho got a rapid name change. The setting for the Orochi Saga, in which we learn that Kyo's ancestors defeated the Orochi of the Yamata, began with this game.


Benimaru Nikaido : This character was loosely based on a comic book character (Jean-Pierre Polnaref from "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure"), and even after the name of Benimaru was decided on, game developers gave the poor guy an identity crisis by continuing to call him by the comic book character's name. The voice for this character, too, had a peculiar bent to it, and when Benimaru's designer heard his creation's victory line of 'Thank you' recited for the first time, rumor has it that he couldn't work for days after : the reading had nothing to do with the character's original image. His speech patterns have led some to question Benimaru's preferences as far as certain lifestyles are concerned.


Goro Daimon : This character comes from the designers' desire to create a judo athlete who uses dynamic body tosses. His initial designs incurred the criticism of some fellow designers who were of the opinion that it was just plain loopy for Daimon to fight wearing Japanese geta (wooden clogs), but Goro's creators were adamant and he kept his footwear. The suggestions for his laconic victory lines and the sound of an explosion when Goro is victorious also stuck.


Terry Bogard : When the concept for KOF was first formulated, Terry was tacked on to the roster as an afterthought, but his popularity skyrocketed! He became the character who got the designers' utmost attention, and they fretted over various aspects of his character. In the first KOF, Terry became the powerhouse, getting a super punch cancel move added to his arsenal and becoming the fearsome character he is today.


Andy Bogard : Compared to Andy's original form ("Fatal Fury - King of Fighters"), Andy changed little in his move to KOF, but what he got in return was the addition of his Ultra Disruptor move to his arsenal of moves. When first added, it boasted overwhelming power : it was easy to use, never missed, trumped other moves, and annihilated all opponents.


Joe Higashi : Joe is a character who underwent a major image makeover from his transition from "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters". The victory pose of KOF '94 initially lacked the toothy smile we're familiar with now. It was quite a thorn in the side that we felt inappropriate for Joe's legion of fans. So, in rethinking the original design, we added the pearly whites that makes Joe to loveable character he is today.


Ryo Sakazaki : Ryo (as can be said of all characters from "Art of Fighting") has so many Special Moves that it seems almost unfair to the other characters, and in the designing stage, the Art of Fighting team tended to be the strongest. The designers focused on adjusting this imbalance without taking out any moves, but in the end Ryo and his team remain the toughest competitors.


Robert Garcia : Overall, KOF's characters are fit and trim, but compared to their original concepts, Robert is the slimmest of them all. Matched up against Kensou, he chide his adversary in Japanese with an Osaka accent, allowing players to enjoy the amusing word play that Osaka comedians are known for.


Takuma Sakazaki : Since the Takuma of "Art of Fighting 2" closely resembled Daimon, he received a karate tunic in his ensemble to set him apart and that's why he looks the way he does today. He originally had a combo attack after the 'Super Shrike Gale' move that appeared to be a glitch. Hence, during game development, this move was taken out, but the game designers thought that he just wasn't Takuma without this move and it was put back in. The designers slightly regret their decision because Takuma's become quite a mean little bugger as a result.


Yuri Sakazaki : Yuri is a disciple of Kyokugen Karate but her appearances in the KOF series are frequently as a member of the women fighters' team. Originally in KOF '94 there was no such team and production began on King Billy Big Bear as the English team. But "Art of Fighting 2" was completed at that time and the designers pressed to put Yuri into KOF, replacing her with Big Bear, who was presenting various problems, for various reasons (hah, hah) concerning capacity. Enter Yuri, goodbye Billy! (A tragedy, we know) And so the originally planned team started life anew as the mighty women fighters' team.


Heidern : Heidern was devised as a cold-blooded killing machine when he first saw digital life, but as the KOF story unfolded, Heidern's designer identified with the character and provided him with a tragic past. When his super special moves were completed, the moves were so wild that game designers worried that he would have to be depicted as a sorcerer or an alien in order to explain his dazzling moves.


Ralf Jones : In the first stages of Ralf's development, he appeared shirtless to truly express the feeling of ikari or rage, but during the designing phase, someone felt his look was a bit dated and Ralf got the apparel he's now known and loved for. He originally had special moves that allowed him to use grenades, setting him apart from other team members, and a distinctive design, but his use of grenades in a fighting competition was deemed a bit unfair, so he lost that particular talent.


Clark Steel : At the beginning of development, the only differences in designs for Ralf and Clark was one had a hat and the other had a bandanna, but Clark later got a pair of sunglasses to become the character he is today. Clark basically looks a lot like Ralf, but since the designer in charge of adjusting this character worked on his hit accuracy, action speed and attack strength, their combat style is where the true differences between the two can be found.


Athena Asamiya : Given that Athena is always the most highly anticipated character of the series, the pressure to keep her on the roster at any cost is pretty overwhelming. And because SNK staff focuses so much on her, SNK have been accused of favoritism. Japanese fans asked SNK to dress her in a sailor blouse and skirt, but we scrubbed that idea because SNK felt it wouldn't translate overseas and be a bit too risque. But SNK made up for that omission with her wild entrance actions (Hubba! Hubba!).


Sie Kensou : Compared with Athena, Kensou's design has been a bit slapdash. In the previous title, Athena stole the show and since we felt Kensou was a bit too overshadowed by her, SNK gave him a radically new look to appeal to our female fans. We're often asked about Kensou's use of Japanese with an Osaka accent in the game, but he's always done that since his Psycho Soldier days. In other words, he's been doing it far longer than Robert has.


Chin Gentsai : When SNK first decided to try our hands at a fighting game, SNK felt we just had to have a geezer who used the Drunken Fist form of martial arts. Getting the OK, SNK introduced this character as Athena's teacher. As we aimed to create a genuine Drunken Fist master, SNK thought it would be hard to get the right touch, but since designer was good at drawing old guys, the finished product far exceeded original expectations. Unfortunately for the designer, he was unable to shake this habit and all of his subsequent characters tended to look like spry old men.


Mai Shiranui : Regarding Mai's familiar pause action... One day, the designer for Mai asked if it was all right to increase Mai's pause actions, and because the powers that be thought there was enough remaining memory for the game (actually there wasn't) they said, 'Go for it'. When the completed pose was presented, it knocked people flat. Due to this pose's potency, however, Mai's eye-popping motions were stilled in the KOF '94 international home version.


King : As far as King's super special moves go, there were various reasons why the 'Surprise Rose' was initially scheduled to be scrapped. Just when the development staff was worrying about coming up with a move that was something different, though, King's designer whipped this move up, it was well received, and it became her super special move, with no alterations needed.


Heavy D! : Since there has been a number of boxers in fighting games, Heavy D! was designed with the intent to create a different type of pugilist. When he first appeared on the drawing board, D! was not intended to be that big a character, but as he evolved and stood among the other characters it became apparent that he was one huge dude. ...Due to certain production circumstances, however, D! kept his imposing stature and came to be the character he is today.


Lucky Glauber : Known as the basketball fighter, Lucky's original image was based on the character appearing in the Bruce Lee movie, 'Game of Death'. Though originally created with that image in mind, his first design was deemed too plain and he then received his current look. His ability to use karate, though, is a remnant of his original conception.


Brian Battler : Brian came into being well before the KOF project came down the pike, and he's one of the oldest characters. He originally wore a helmet and chest pad, but he shed that equipment to arrive at his current design.


Kim Kaphwan : At first, the duo of Chang and Choi were set to team with another vicious criminal to form the Fugitive Team, but due to certain circumstances the third criminal was replaced with Kim and the familiar team came into being. The addition of Kim was considered somewhat forced, however, so Kim received the mission of rehabilitating the two.


Chang Koehan : Chang was originally far more violent than he is today, but once he teamed up with Kim, he became mellowed a bit. Chang's super special move, the Wild Ball, was originally designed as a test move, but it got such a good response that it was put into the game without alteration. This move is a pastiche of Kim's Phoenix Kick.


Choi Bounce : Choi is KOF's mighty novelty character. His original design looked way too much like a certain someone, so he was hastily given a new look a month before the final character designs had to be completed, giving Choi's designers one major headache. The first time Choi displayed his attacking and retreating moves and rolled around the screen, he revealed not only his fighting abilities but his talent for physical comedy.


An interesting thing about Chang and Choi : Chang was the tallest and heaviest KOF character, while Choi was the lightest and shortest. The duo is very popular in Japan, but hated by American fans. Because of their size differences, they have made a (quite) comedic couple, making the Korean team (or the Kim team) the comedy-relief team of KOF.


Rugal Bernstein : The concept for this character at the time was to make the mightiest (most violent) and most evil boss character ever. As everyone knows, Rugal is the King of Bosses who boasts the most appearances in the KOF series as a boss character, but even considering the whole genre known as 'competitive fighting games', his story and moves have changed ever so gradually while appearing in so many titles, he's one of the few bosses to have been loved (heh, heh) over such a long period.


Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '94 - PCCB-00162) on 21/10/1994.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Select Victory Pose : Press a Punch or Kick button immediately after winning a match.


* Critical Hit Oddity : A critical hit is an attack done at the opponent while he/she is attacking. In this game there is a bug that enables either the CPU or the player to take out insane amounts of damage if this is done right. An easy-to-do example is to counter Kim's Hisho-Kyaku with Heidern's Moon Cutter (you must hit Kim's legs with Heidern's hand), if done right you'll take 80-90% off Kim's life-bar in one hit! Try it with other characters and be amazed (This does not work in any other game in the KOF series, though!). :)


* Beat the game without continuing to see all the characters grouped together on the The End screen.

- TRIVIA -


Released in July 1995.


The background for the Japan Team is, in fact, a real place.


Yuri's Chou Upper is very similar to Sakura's own Shou'ou Ken.


Iori Yagami : Since the KOF '95 project began with the concept of introducing Iori as Kyo's rival, he became known as a character who was a member of a rival school of martial arts that had a connection to the Ancient Arts of the Kusanagi. He was also given the ability to use a different color of flames other than Kyo's (red flames), along with various other characteristics. When you think of Iori Yagami, his intense personality most likely comes to mind. His moves are unique, and his singular choice of hairstyle, wardrobe, and manner of speaking was certainly a personality that broke the mold for characters in fighting games at that time. During the initial location tests to determine the popularity of the game, Iori was the character who stood out most. His hair and his lines to provoke his opponents ('You think I'm scary, do you?') excited his fans to no end. What set him apart are his memorable lines: 'You cry! You scream! Then you die!', 'Think of me when you gaze at the moon', and a whole catalog of others too numerous to list here.


Billy Kane : Along with Eiji, Billy appears as Iori's 'teammate' (ha, ha) in KOF'95. With the three rivals to the heroes coincidentally appearing on a single team, the name of the 'Rival Team' was decided upon as an afterthought. But since we couldn't wait for the rest of the world to get used to that concept and given the insanity of Iori, the team had to disband after their single appearance in KOF'95. As memory serves, the designers for this team were so motivated to create this team that their finished product was quite impressive. As a matter of fact, the voice actors worked like busy beavers to give the characters their lines. These characters were portrayed by Mr. Namase in '95, Mr. Yamanishi in '97, '98 and '02 and Seijiro in '03.


Omega Rugal : After apparently dying in KOF '94, Rugal's resurrection in KOF '95 turned him, convincingly enough, into a cyborg (prosthetic arms) armed (pardon the pun) with the power of the Orochi. In the subsequent titles of KOF '98 and KOF 2002, Rugal was brought back not once but twice to conclude story-lines. Why? "He's the only character who truly represents the ultimate KOF boss". Among these, Omega Rugal from KOF '98 was the most powerful and had the flashiest moves, so he's one of our personal favorite boss characters of the series.


Saisyu Kusanagi : His first appearance was, of course, in KOF '94, but his presence in KOF '95 was never planned (because he was supposed to have died in '94). During the final stages of KOF '95, he suddenly was inserted as a mid-level boss. That's who Saisyu Kusanagi is. Given that spur of the moment appearance, it's quite unexpected that he's still a very popular character? no offense to him, mind you. During location tests for the game, not one of his fans read the Chinese characters for his name as 'Saisyu', and he came to be known as 'Shibafune'.


Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '95 - PCCB-00187) on 19/08/1995.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Play as Rugal and Saisyu Kusanagi : At the team edit screen, the 15 second counter, press and hold Start. While holding start, push Up+B, Right+C, Left+A and Down+D. The two bosses should then appear on either side of the counter and the counter should reset back to 15.


* Select Victory Pose : Press a Punch or Kick button immediately after winning a match.


* Beat the game on Hard or MVS mode without continuing to see a collage of all the teams after the credits.

- TRIVIA -


Released in July 1996.


This is the first game to include special phrases and poses when two characters in particular fight. In this game, it happens only with Kyo Vs. Iori, Terry Vs. Geese and Ralf Jones vs Clark Steel.


Ryo Sakazaki's fighting stance changed from the regular 'dukes up' to try and distance him from being thought of as a Ryu ripoff. His basic moves, however, remained unchanged.


Yuri's Yuri Chou Mawashi Geri is a knock-off of Ryu's Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku.


If you look at the game code for this game, you would have seen more moves that were originally planned for this game, but never made the cut (for some characters, these moves debuted in later games).

Among those moves that were cut were Kyo's Saishuu Kessen Ougi 'Mu Shiki', Daimon's Arashi no Yama, Robert's Muei Senpuu Juudan Kyaku, Ralf's Umanori Vulcan Punch, Clark's Running Three, Geese's Deadly Rave and Choi's Hou'ou Kyaku.


Geese's music (Geese ni Katakori) is a remixed version of his Fatal Fury 1 theme music (Geese ni Kiss).

A remixed version of Big Shot! (originally Terry's theme music in "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory") was used as the Fatal Fury Team's music.


About Leona : Along with the extensive overhaul to the team lineup of KOF '96, Leona entered the series as a replacement for Heidern, leader of the Ikari Team. Introducing the plot element of Heidern's adopted daughter had been dreamed up by the game designers before the production of KOF '96, and the details surrounding her origins gradually came to include a crucial role as a descendant of the Orochi tribe. Designed with the ardent love of her designers, Leona's special moves are markedly unique compared to the other characters, and reveal the particular tastes of her designers.


About Mature : She used to be Rugal's secretary. For the chief game planner at the time, it seems that both she and Vice were given the image of the 'ruthless woman' and the 'cruel woman' respectively, but when they became actual characters things got a little hectic, and someone came up with, 'Rugal had a secretary, didn't he. Make it two and run with that'. So these two characters came into being (Talk about slacking off). Consequently, they received additional characteristics : they were actually spies sent to observe Rugal and the descendants of the Orochi 8ketsu Clan.


About Vice : If Mature was the 'ruthless woman', Vice was to be the 'cruel woman'. The official illustrations for Vice and Mature remain extremely popular, and we're glad we could supply our fans with these images that cannot be reduced to pixels. The period of development for KOF '96 dragged on right up to the time of its scheduled release. At the location test for this title, Mature and Vice were still not included in the game. It's not that they were hidden, but there wasn't enough time to insert them into this initial version (we can talk about this calmly now, but at the time...forget about it!).


About Goenitz : In spite of the fact of Goenitz's sole official appearance in '96, he continues to have a considerable following of fans to this day, making him one of KOF's most popular characters. With strength that surpasses Rugal, the boss character of '94 and '95, the episode of the young Goenitz taking out the eye of Rugal was added to the game's story. Rugal, in turn, relieved Heidern of one of his eyes, which makes us think that SNK sure seems to have a lot of one-eyed characters, witness Gilbert, Jubei Yagyu, and Ramon. If you look carefully at the Goenitz the designer drew at the time (with a little help), you'll notice the shiver-inducing moment in which Goenitz appears to have six fingers.


About Geese Howard : The dream event for SNK's most recognizable characters! ...and what dream event would be complete without the appearance of Geese? Naturally, he's the character who people hope appears in the game each year, and there were plans to have him appear in KOF '95 long before. Various considerations at the time, however, led developers to abandon this plan. Then, with the time being ripe, Geese reappeared in KOF '96. Even throughout the game, this boss team received special treatment : things like leitmotif music were prepared for each member and at the time of this title's release, enthusiasm for this game reached a feverish pitch. Numerous special moves were prepared for Geese, but in view of the memory capacity and time required for adjustments, a good number of Super Special Moves had to be left out. A waste, really...


About Wolfgang Krauser : In KOF '96 the Boss Team was formed! And with that, Krauser entered the tournament, teaming up with his half brother Geese... but at the time, in terms of memory limitations and the KOF system of that time, it was a tough environment to faithfully depict the Krauser of Fatal Fury. Developers still cringe remembering the numerous criticisms, big and small, regarding the Fatal Fury Team's treatment. KOF '96 saw the debut of Krauser as a player character, but in the ending sequence he did make a cameo in KOF '94.


About Mr. BIG : For a variety of reasons, the Krauser of KOF got a bad rap, but BIG received favorable reviews from the fans. BIG is an austere villain brimming over with adult appeal-that's the character of Mr. BIG. The behavior of the women who hang with him also is based on a certain video the designers of the time often watched. The woman mutters, "He's bad", but just what does that actually mean? The truth remains a deep mystery. During the development stage, a positive slide for his Super Special Moves included one labeled "Spinning Stick Thrust, Kind of Like an Anti-Air Assault". We'd like to think that the move wasn't scrapped because of the vagueness of its name, but it's too bad the general public never got to see it. It rocks!


Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '96 - PCCB-00223) on 21/08/1996.

- TRIVIA -


Released in July 1997.


Yuri has a long record of taking movements from other characters, especially Capcom (see previous KOF entries). In this new opus : Yuri's new special attack 'Hien Rekkou' is a knock off of Ken's Shoryuu Reppa.


Roddy and Cathy from "Top Hunter - Roddy & Cathy" appear in the Kowloon background at the extreme left.

Other characters appearing in the Kowloon stage are : Roddy Birts and Lenny Creston from "Art of Fighting 3 - The Path of the Warrior".

The American Sports team from "The King of Fighters '94".

Lee Pai Long, Tung Fu Rue and Jubei Yamada from "Art of Fighting" and "Fatal Fury Special" and King's Waitresses with Rugal's panther.


The Terry's theme music was originally from "Real Bout Fatal Fury Special".

The Ryuji Yamazaki and Mary's Blues theme music was originally from "Real Bout Fatal Fury Special".

The Athena Asamiya thene music come from "Psycho Soldier".


The name of the 3 characters instrumental in the defeat of Orochi have some relation to the original legend :

1) Kyo Kusanagi : The Kusanagi is the name of the sword that was used to kill the Great Serpent.

2) Iori Yagami : One of his moves, the Ya Sakazuki, means '8 wine cups', which were needed to get the Great Serpent drunk.

3) Chizuru Kagura : She was the last surviving member of the Yata clan and the mirror used to seal Orochi away was a homage to the mirror in the legend (in the legend, it was a mirror created by the Great Serpent's tears).


In this iteration of KOF and the following games where he is a playable character, Choi Bounge gains a special throw (using the D button) where he pokes his claws up the opponents rear, this is actually supposed to be a Japanese prank, but the pranksters do not use claws.


About Ryuji Yamazaki : To bring the story that had grown too large and out of control back on track, the members of the Orochi 8ketsu Clan were teamed up in '97. By doing this, the dev. team thought, the story would reach its conclusion for the time being... but among the 3 new faces including Leona's father Gaidell, the dev. team lacked one more member for the 8ketsu. What should we do?... And along came Ryuji Yamazaki to bail us out of our predicament. A snake charmer that even looked like a snake, he became a popular villain. He once humbled himself, joined up with the Fatal Fury team, and blended into the world of KOF more than we had predicted. The game planner at that time really knocked himself out to provide new moves for Yamazaki. Idea after idea got a short trip to the circular file (Attract opponent after Snake Charmer move; Seven Serpent Dagger Throw, etc.), and those failures led to successful moves like the Sand Sweeper.


About Blue Mary : Receiving the strong support of fans in a magazine's popularity poll, Blue Mary made her name known to the public, appearing in KOF from '97. Losing to Blue Mary in the popularity contest, as a matter of fact, was Duck King. This popularity contest truly decided the fate of these 2. From '97 to '03, Mary became a regular to the series for the staff. Duck, on the other hand, hit the skids, and he was relegated to cameos at the side of screens, in backgrounds, or as a Striker character. Doesn't this fleeting episode make you think about the impermanence of everything? Since the designer in charge of Mary preferred her outfit in "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory", she's kept that look until now. It seems to have worked.


About Yashiro Nanakase : Yashiro's team was created to offset the remaining top 3 characters. With the combination of their use of 3 elements-Kyo and Chris representing fire, Benimaru and Shermie signifying lightning, and Daimon and Yashiro standing in for the earth-the concept for Yashiro and his cohorts as rivals to the series' heroes was further emphasized. It also explains the battle of hairstyles (and bands, too) between Yashiro and Iori. In consideration to events going on in the world today, designers have expiated some of Yashiro's more wicked ending lines-such as, 'Execution, accomplished.'-and tossed them into the dustbin of game history. Incidentally, some of the production codes for his Super Special Move commands consisted of moves like the '260 Million Slams'. Some of his dumped moves included 'Human Surfing'.


About Shermie : Shermie is a glamorous girl who works as a fashion designer and plays in a band as a hobby. But in fact she is one of the 4 Orochi leaders who's adept at body slams. Come to think of it, she's quite an enigmatic character. The material for Shermie the 'Raging Lightning Flash' comes from L the Third. And even more trivia : the character of Yashiro comes from Bl.. G... Xa..gle and the character of Chris is derived from A.T. V...ms. The design for Shermie was easily decided on. Given her long bangs that will absolutely never reveal her eyes, she was called Tesse from "Waku Waku 7" at one time. Her hidden eyes burn with a homicidal glare it is said, but there's no material that reveals what her face actually looks like.


About Chris : Chris can kill with an innocent smile on his face-kind of a creepy personality trait, come to think of it (but he looks so cute, doesn't he?). To pull things together and bring the story concerning the leaders of the Orochi and the 8-ketsu clan to its climax once and for all in '97, a lot of story elements were forced onto Chris who became the vessel fort the Orochi (this actually began from the early stages of production). And there's a story behind Chris's Super Special Move line, 'Ripping the chrysalis, the butterfly flutters'.


About Orochi : At first, designers planned a rather extreme setting in which a buck-naked Chris battled with a glowing energy ball, but for better or worse went with the current design (A survey of the designers garnered a mere 2 votes for the design for a buck-naked Chris). Incidentally, his design codename was 'Chief'. A lot of people were against the name 'Orochi', too, but these days it has become a firmly established proper noun in gaming lingo.


About Orochi Iori : The powers that be, who created the stories for the boss characters to heat things up for the series with KOF '97, first decided to make the final boss an Orochi to conclude the series' "Orochi Saga". The stage bosses were an easy choice : the 3 remaining characters of the Four Orochi Deities. This was followed with the suggestion to make the final boss Iori, 'berserk with the Orochi blood rage'. So the 'Minor', 'Middle', and 'Major' bosses were decided, with the 'Orochi Iori' we know and love rounding off the quartet as the final boss. Because this character was originally designed as a player character at the time, he's designed to mow down the other characters with relative ease.


About Orochi Leona : If Iori appeared berserk with the Orochi blood, the other successor in the bloodline of the 8-ketsu Clan, Leona, was also destined to go berserk someday. That's how this character came about. But inexplicably the design team wanted to heat up battles against the computer. So various sequences such as televised broadcasts were added, and provided a turn of nail-biting events that sent players to a 'fork in the game' that would pit them up against either Orochi Iori or Orochi Leona in the end. But savvy players who knew how to get a character to appear would be able to select their particular routes.


About Kyo Kusanagi Version '94 : Along with KOF '96 game system changes, Kyo got a new arsenal of different Special Moves, and the wielder of the 'Dark Thrust' was as popular as ever. And designers also added the KOF '94 version of Kyo Kusanagi to satisfy all our fans. Designers were apprehensive about returning to the old character design, but this all disappeared with the warm acceptance of fans.


About Shingo Yabuki : : The code name for this character in the early stages was 'Shingo Suzuki'. The plainness of his name conversely suited Shingo quite well, we thought, but what do you think ? He was originally based on Kyo with the concept of becoming a comic, everyday guy foil, but in spite of our intention to promote him simply and plainly, he was splashed all over the place and his silhouette appeared in pre-promotion campaigns in magazines, becoming an extensively hyped character. And his voice was supplied by the famous Japanese voice actor Taketo Koyasu. And one more thing, Shingo is a character who can't shoot flames. And probably never will.


A hack of this game is known as "The King of Fighters '97 Plus" and allows you to play evil versions of Leona, Iori and the Orochi team plus Orochi himself.

Another hack is known as "King of Gladiator".


Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'. 


Pony Canyon released a 2 CD limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '97 - PCCB-00273) on 20/08/1997.

- TRIVIA -


Released in July 1998.


This game is known in Japan as "The King of Fighters '98 - Dream Match Never Ends".


It is said that this game is a 'dream match' for more reasons than one - this KOF is said to exist only in Shingo's dream - each character in this dream match was Shingo's impression of these characters, based on either personal experience or his notes in his notebook.


Yuri has a long record of taking movements from other characters, especially Capcom (see previous KOF entries). In this new opus : Yuri's new special attack 'Shin! Chou Upper' is a knock off of Ryu's Shin Shoryuu Ken. She also has a movement similar to Terry's burn knuckle. Finally, her Forward+A is a parody of Sakura's Flower Kick.


KOF98 contains pieces of music from older KOFs.

For example, the character select music when a second player joins in is straight from KOF 96 (it's called Roulette).

Here's a complete list of themes, the teams (or individuals) they belong to and the games they were taken from :

Esaka? (Japan Team) : KOF 96 (Japan Team's theme music).

Esaka (95-style Kyo Kusanagi) : KOF 94 (Japan Team's theme music).

Kurikinton (Fatal Fury Team) : Fatal Fury 2 (Terry Bogard's theme music).

Art of Fight (Art of Fighting Team) : Art of Fighting (Ryo Sakazaki's and Ryuhaku Todo's theme music).

Rumbling in the City (Ikari Team) : KOF 96 (Ikari Team's theme music).

Shin! Senritsu no Dora (Psycho Soldier Team) : KOF95 (Psycho Soldier Team's theme music).

Fairy (Gals Fighters Team) : KOF 96 (Chizuru Kagura's theme music).

Seoul Town (Korea Team) : Real Bout Fatal Fury (Kim Kaphwan's theme music).

Bloody (New Face Team) : KOF 97 (New Face Team's theme music).

Rhythmic Hallucination (Orochi Yashiro) : KOF 97 (Orochi New Face Team's theme music).

C62 (Ryuji Yamazaki) : Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Ryuji Yamazaki's theme music).

Blue Mary's Blues (Blue Mary) : Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Blue Mary's theme music).

London March (Billy Kane) : Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Billy Kane's theme music).

Arashi no Saxophone (Iori Yagami) : KOF 95 (Revenge Team's theme music).

Arashi no Saxophone 2 (Mature, Vice) : KOF 96 (Iori Team's theme music).

Slum No. 5 (USA Sports Team) : KOF 94 (USA Sports Team's theme music).

Still Green (Shingo Yabuki) : KOF 97 (Shingo Yabuki's theme music).

Ketchaku R&D (Omega Rugal) : first half from KOF 94 (Rugal Bernstein's theme music), second half from KOF 95 (Omega Rugal's theme music).

Ne! ('94 Gals Fighters Team) : KOF 94 (Gals Fighters Team's theme music).


Also to note that the music that is played prior to facing Rugal (Kettou R&D) is also from KOF 94 (as the theme for Rugal's first form).


When Choi Bounge appears, a 7 seconds sample from a song is played. This song is 'Choi Bounge Ondo', which appeared in the KOF 97 Arrange SoundTracks. The song became quite popular in Japan.


Mr. Big from "Art of Fighting" makes a small cameo appearance in the USA Wharf background, during the first rounds.


About Kyo Version 95 : Because the introduction of different versions for this character included as "hidden features" in KOF '97 was such a hit with fans, designers thought, another version of Kyo in KOF '98 would make the game more inviting. Designers also remember that both versions for Kyo Kusanagi for game tests were equally popular. This concept for different versions of this character subsequently became the basis for the 'Kyo clones'.


In the Japan Street stage, during the second round if you look in the middle of the background where some shops are, you can see tiny moving people who look like Iori, Mai and Terry Bogard. In the third and fifth round, you can see two people doing hand signals, they look similar to Kyo Kusanagi & Shingo Yabuki. In the fourth round, you can see Mai and Terry.


A serious bug : Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners don't use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neo+geo bios s1 tile-set rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the main-board z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attact loop after game over, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.


Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.


Pony Canyon released a 2 CD limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '98 - PCCB-00334) on 19/08/1998.


- UPDATES -


At the Intro music (CIPHER) and the Staff Roll BGM (ZERO) a sample used says 'mot*er fu**er'. Apparently, this sample was removed in some non-Japanese carts.

The SNK Neo Geo AES European homecart version of Kizuna Encounter is one of the most expensive and rare video games of all time, there is rumored to be no more than 10 copies, 4 confirmed circulating in Europe and the US, and the last one sold for around $12,500. Several rumors as to the scarcity of European cartridges make the rounds among fans but it is widely believed that the game's poor sales in Europe led to cartridges getting sent back to Japan. It is likely their ROM chips were deleted and used for other games or that the cartridges were simply outfitted with Japanese labels and sold again since the Japanese versions as such were identical to the European ones.

Klax (c) 1989 Atari Games.


The tiles klank end over end down the ramp. Catch them on the paddle, or they fall in the pit. Flip them from the paddle into the bins, matching the same-colored tiles horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each line of colored tiles is a Klax. When you've made a Klax, you hear a fanfare. When you complete a wave, the crowd cheers. Let a tile fall in the pit, and you hear a scream as it falls in. If you fail to complete a wave, the crowd is disappointed. Stay alive, complete the waves and don't drop any tiles!


Catch the tiles as they come to the end of the ramp on the paddle. Flip a tile into a bin by pressing the start/flip button. Pull the joystick forward to increase the speed of the closest tile as it klanks down the ramp. Push the joystick back and toss the top tile on the paddle back on the ramp and gain a little time.


The paddle can hold up to five tiles. As long as the green light is on below the paddle, you can pile more tiles on the paddle. When the red light appears, you must flip at least one tile in a bin or toss it back on the ramp before you can collect any more tiles. You can flip tiles into a bin as long as the green light is on below the bin.


To succeed in Klax, make points and also complete each wave. Create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of at least three tiles (just like in tic-tac-toe) in the bins to make a Klax and make points. You receive the most points for diagonals, less for horizontals and the least for verticals. When you create a Klax, the tiles in the Klax disappear to make room for more tiles in the bins.


Each wave has a different task to be completed, which is shown on the To Go Meter. This task could be making a certain number of Klaxes or points or surviving a certain number of tiles. Complete the task before too many tiles drop in the pit and you complete the wave. When you complete a wave, you receive bonus points for the tiles remaining on the ramp, on the paddle, and any empty spaces in the bins. If you fail, you can start again at the same wave.


Klax does not have a clock for you to race against, but as your playing time increases, the tiles klank down the ramp faster and faster.


Waves : When you first enter the game, you can start at wave 1, 6, or 11. Wave 1 teaches you how to play the game and use the controls. At every fifth wave you can choose to play the next wave, the fifth wave beyond, or the tenth wave beyond.


Klax has five different types of waves and more than five different backgrounds. There are five waves per level, and one hundred waves to complete.


Each time you begin a wave, the To Go meter shows what kind of Klaxes or how many points you need to accumulate to complete the wave. The different types of waves are :

* Klaxes To Go, which are the easiest. Just create Klaxes horizontally, vertically or horizontally. Create enough Klaxes to complete the wave before you drop too many tiles in the pit.

* Tiles To Go requires you to survive a certain number of tiles. Create Klaxes in any of the three ways to collect points and to clear the bins to hold more tiles.

* Points To Go requires you to make a certain number of points. Create Klaxes to collect points but make diagonals, four- or five-of-a-kind Klaxes, and simultaneous Klaxes for higher points.

* Diagonals To Go requires you to create diagonals. Create Klaxes in any way to collect points; but only the correct number of diagonals will complete the wave.

* Horizontals To Go requires you to create horizontals. Only horizontal Klaxes will complete the wave; but you can create Klaxes vertically and diagonally to collect points.


You see several kinds of information on the screen. These are the :

* To Go Meter which continuously calculates the number of Klaxes, tiles, points, diagonals or horizontals still required to complete the wave. The number depends on the type of wave you are playing.

* Drop Count, which shows the number of dropped tiles. The drop count is continuously calculated. When the number of tiles dropped is reached, the wave is over.

* High Score, which shows the highest score to date, regardless of the number of continues that player had.

* Wave Indicator, which shows what wave you are playing.

Earning Extra Lifes : In stage 2, lose 1 life against boss. Beat him. When you come to the 3rd stage, don't break the barricades, just wait. First kill the Fat-Man and the Soldier. 

WARNING : If you launch a desperation attack (attack+jump), all the effort will be lost.

Then wait until the Bird Man comes run against you. Hit him with a strong strike (push front+punch). Don't hit him while is recovering. Wait until he runs to you again and make the same. you can kill him after 3 strikes (unless with Lancelot).

If you're done correctly, hit the barricade of the above, don't pick the food, try to turn apart it, and you'll get a surprise... a cheess pieces with 2 lifes (2UP) waiting for you.

If you kill the second Bird-Man in the same way, the second item in the barricade will give you 1 more level (green sceptre).

If you remember, a 3rd Bird-Man gets into the castle when you break the bridge's barricade. Do the same trick with him inside, break the down barricade, break the item and you'll get one more life (1UP).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Begin by filling in the box in the lower left-hand corner. Once you've done that, fill in the two boxes (vertically) to its right, then the three to their right, and so on until you've effectively wrapped around the playfield and are back at the first box you filled in. Just repeat this motion until all of the boxes are full.


* Filling in boxes two at a time will give you twice the points of each of the boxes. Filling in three boxes at a time (this is done by going over the point shared by the three boxes last) gives you four times points for the boxes.


You can also get points by punching out enemies. If you can punch out an enemy while the ambulance is still on the screen, you get six hundred points instead of the three hundred for just punching out an enemy.

The game was originally called Mother-ship, and the mechanics were developed by Marvin Glass. However, the realistic-looking game did not test very well, it was supposed to use a mirror to reflect the image of a ship onto the play-field. In an attempt to save the project, Bill's new design of the game introduced the cute green alien called KAP'N KROOZ'R that Bally Midway executives hoped would be the next fad like "Pac-Man" was for Namco (note : KAP'N KROOZ'R next appearance was in "Wacko").

Krull (c) 1983 Gottlieb.


The left joystick controls the movement of the player character, Colwyn. He can be moved in any one of eight directions. The right joystick controls the movement of the player's weapon, the glaze. It can be thrown in any one of eight directions. Four glaives can be in flight at one time and will return to Colwyn with a boomerang-type action. The one and two player select buttons are also located on the panel.


Krull consists of five subgames :

1. The Mountain Game.

2. The Swamp Game.

3. The Fortress Game.

4. The Hexagon Game.

5. The Beast Game.


The player must accomplish a task in each of the five games with eight levels of difficulty in each. All eight levels can be reached in one task based on the time spent performing that task (amount of time spent on that subgame). The total number of lethal characters on the screen at one time increases as the levels increase.


FROM THE SKY WILL COME THE BLACK FORTRESS. FROM THE FORTRESS WILL COME THE SLAYERS, TO DEVOUR THE PLANET OF KRULL. THEN SHALL A GIRL OF ANCIENT NAME BECOME QUEEN, AND THE KING SHE CHOOSES SHALL RULE THE PLANET.


The planet Krull is threatened by the Beast. His army of Slayers has brought terror to the land. Colwyn must stop this terror and save the land and its people. On the day Colwyn is to wed the Princess Lyssa, the Slayers, army of the Beast, kidnap her to become the Beast's bride. Colwyn must reach the Black Fortress and reclaim his Princess. He who marries the Princess shall be king. The Beast must not be allowed to rule the planet.


A prophet acquaints Colwyn with the magical properties of the glaive, a five-bladed sword, which Colwyn must acquire. To accomplish this task, he must climb the mountain and collect the five individual blades of the glaive in order to assemble the weapon. The blade is picked up by touching Colwyn to the blade. Boulders are fatal and must be avoided. The weapon joystick is not utilized in this subgame. The player is awarded 1,000 points for each blade picked up. Points are also awarded for placing Colwyn in a dangerous position in front of one or more boulders.


During his travels to discover the Black Fortress, Colwyn comes upon an army of eight men that he befriends and recruits to help him in his quest to destroy the Beast so that Krull can be safe from his evil.


With no intentions of losing his newly acquired bride without bloodshed, the Beast orders an army of Slayers to stop Colwyn and his friends. Forging through the quicksand-riddled swamps, Slayers materialize from the soil and Colwyn prepares for battle. In the second subgame, Colwyn must save as many friends as possible while killing all of the Slayers. The friends are saved by touching them and the Slayers are destroyed by the glaive. The Slayers themselves and their spears must be avoided. The game begins with eight friends. The number of friends saved is the number of friends carried over into future subgames. The friends can eliminate the Slayers with hand-to-hand combat but can also be destroyed themselves. Receiving three blows either by hand-to-hand or by the Slayers spear is fatal to the friends. The subgame ends when there are no longer any friends to save and all of the Slayers have been eliminated. Avoid quicksand, as it slows Colwyn's attack. Each friend saved awards 1,000 points (maximum 8,000 points) and 100 points for each Slayer the player eliminates.


After days of travel, Colwyn and his men have found the Black Fortress in the Iron Desert where many dangers await them. While attempting to lead his men through the dangerous narrow passageways that lead to the Fortress, Slayers materialize once again in a second attempt to stop Colwyn's struggle. In this third subgame, Colwyn must pick up all of his friends and deposit them safely into the hexagon while again combating the Slayers. The total number of friends in this subgame is equal to the total number of friends saved in Subgame 2. This subgame concludes when all of the friends have been delivered to the hexagon. The player is awarded 1,000 points for each friend delivered to the hexagon, 100 points for each Slayer he destroys and 100 points for each Slayer remaining when the last friend is delivered to the hexagon.


Victorious in battle, Colwyn must now attempt to release his friends from the hexagon. Unlike entry, exiting the hexagon is a struggle deservant of its own merit. Once again Colwyn must call upon the power of the glaive. Release of his friends is accomplished by throwing the glaive at the front wall while it is black only. Any glaive striking the wall while it is not black will stick in the wall until the wall becomes black. The Slayers, of course, attempt to stop Colwyn's efforts. In his own attempt for survival, Colwyn must fight them off and avoid their spears. The subgame ends when the last black wall is broken through and the friends have escaped. The player is awarded 100 points for each Slayer he puts an end to, 100 points for each Slayer remaining when the friends are set free and 1,000 points for the first black wall destroyed, 2,000 points for the second, 3,000 points for the third and 4,000 points for the fourth.


Now inside the Black Fortress, Colwyn secedes from his friends in order to rescue the Princess Lyssa. He finds her in a large cave carefully guarded by the Beast. He knows that the only way to reclaim his bride and conserve the planet is to forge into battle with the Beast. In the fifth subgame, the player moves Colwyn towards the Princess in order to reach her. As he progresses, the Beast attempts to stop him by throwing fireballs at him. The fireballs must be avoided or destroyed by the glaive. If not destroyed, the fireballs will ricochet off of the walls. Destroying a fireball awards the player 100 points multiplied by the number of fireballs in flight. The Beast is momentarily stunned when hit with a glaive and awards the player 100 points. The Beast cannot be destroyed and the player must avoid touching him. When Colwyn reaches the Princess, his friends, following the pandemonium of the battle, appear and chase the Beast off, awarding 1000 points per friend. The total number of friends in this subgame is equal to the total number of friends saved in Subgame 2.

Released in March 1983.


this game is known in Japan as "Ginga Densetsu Krull" (translates from Japanese as 'Galactic Legend Krull').


Krull was designed and programmed in 10 months. Chris and Matt started on it in early May of 1982 and finished in February of 1983. It is Gottlieb's first movie-themed video game.


Jason Curran holds the official record for this game with 421,590 points.


About the movie : Krull is a world deep in a far-away galaxy, a culture of myth and magic. The kingdoms of Krull, in the past divided by wars, have united to battle the terrible enemy who seeks to dominate them... the Beast. He is a powerful dark force who has returned from Krull's ancient past, determined to destroy all those who oppose him. 

Krull is a $25 million dollar fantasy adventure from Columbia Pictures. To create this special-effect epic, Columbia Pictures has assembled the industry's top talent, people who helped bring Superman and The Empire Strikes Back to the screen. Like those top-grossing films, Krull will appeal primarily to young people under age 25, the most important demographic group for game operators.

- TRIVIA -


Released in December 1984.


This game is known in Japan as "Spartan X".


Kung-Fu Master was the first game that Irem licensed to Data East and was also, more significantly, the world's first sideways-scrolling beat-em-up (and would be the first of two genre-defining fighting games released by Data East that year; the other being 'Karate Champ', the world's first one-on-one fighting game). While understandably not as polished as the games it would go on to inspire, Kung-Fu Master is still regarded as an absolute classic. It is also fiendishly difficult.


The official name for the regular fighters is 'Gripper'. The official name for green-clad boys which make their first appearance on Floor 2 is 'Tom Tom'.


Mike Sullivan holds the official record for this game with 1,349,040 points.


This game is based on the movie 'Wheels on Meals', starring Jackie Chan (as Thomas) and Sammo Hung (who also directed). This movie is called 'Spartan X' in Japan. Also, the game contains some tricks from the Bruce Lee movie 'Game of Death'. In the game you have a 5-Floor Pagoda (which is 'Pope Jusaw' in South-Korea) and the Giant Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. In the movie 'Bruce's Finger', you can see the kidnapping letter and a tied-up girl in a red dress. In the movie 'Goodbye Bruce Lee, his Last Game of Death' you can see the red pillars and the ceiling tape, like in the game.


A french movie, 'Le Petit Amour', by Agnes Varda, doesn't have 'Kung-fu Master' just as the name in USA but also has an intro with a scroll-lateral reference to the game and a lot of scenes of the game itself too! One thing that can cause some strangeness is the fact that the movie is a romance and not a fighting/action movie as the US name can propose.


A bootleg of this game was released by O.K. corp. in 1985.


- UPDATES -


Differences between Spartan X and Kung-Fu Master :

* During the demo screen the word Kung-Fu (in 'A KUNG-FU MASTER, THOMAS....') is spelled 'KANFU' in Spartan X.

* Spartan X has an additional copyright notice that is not in Kung-Fu Master : '(C)1984 Paragon Films Ltd., Towa Promotion'.


- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is relatively simple. Some of the scoring depends on whether you kick or punch an enemy. You get more points punching enemies.


Punch on Grippers : 200 points

Punch on Tom Toms : 300 points

Punch on Knife Throwers : 800 points (Require 2 hits)


Kick on Grippers : 100 points

Kick on Tom Toms : 200 points

Kick on Knife Throwers : 500 points (Require 2 hits)


Jump Kick on Grippers : 200 points

Jump Kick on Tom Toms : 300 points

Jump Kick on Knife Throwers : 800 points (Require 2 hits)


If you kick or punch into a group, you have a chance of knocking more then one fighter off the floor. The progressions for this are...


Progression for Jump Kick or Punch :

1 person : 200 points

2 persons : 400 points

3 persons : 600 points

4 persons : 800 points


For everyone beyond the 4th person, it stays at 800 points.


Progression for a Kick or Low Sweep :

1 person : 100 points

2 persons : 200 points

3 persons : 300 points

4 persons : 400 points


For everyone beyond the 4th person, it stays at 400 points.


On the 2nd and 4th floors, you will encounter some different enemies.

Dragons : 2000 points

Confetti Balls : 1000 points

Vases (Kicked) : 200 points

Vases (Punched) : 100 points

Poisonous Moths (Kicked) : 500 points

Poisonous Moths (Punched) : 600 points


You also get points for the bosses :

1st Floor (Stick Fighter) : 2000 points

2nd Floor (Boomerang Fighter) : 3000 points

3rd Floor (Giant) : 4000 points

4th Floor (Black Magician) : 5000 points

5th Floor (Mr. X) : 10000 points


At the end of each floor, you will receive bonus points by adding your time remaining + your remaining energy. To complete a floor, you must go up the stairs to the next floor.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, Thomas will be at the right side of the screen. It will then be your job to navigate him through the five floors to Mr. X. On each floor, you are under a time crunch. The Timer starts at 2000 and only stops when you go up the stairs to the next floor. Sometimes players forget this and think after you defeat the boss then the floor is over.


* If Thomas is grabbed by the Grippers or Tom Toms, just rapidly shake the joystick left and right. This will throw them off of Thomas although you get no points for it. You will lose energy if they hold on to you plus Thomas cannot fight while being held.


* Knife Throwers can be particularly dangerous. In the lower levels, they throw at a medium or high height. Later on, they also will throw low. It takes two hits to take out a Knife Thrower. In the higher levels, don't be surprised if Thomas has a Knife Thrower on either side of him. The best way to counter this is to move toward the left or right to get one of the Knife Throwers off the screen and deal with the other one.


* Speaking about the above two points, a particularly dangerous situation emerges when Thomas is being held and Knife Throwers appear on the scene. You have to rapidly get Thomas free and deal with the Knife Throwers. Failing to do this will result in a quick death for Thomas.


* Try to make it to the boss as quickly as possible since you are on limited time. You will know when the boss is around since all other people on the screen disappear.


* As you are moving along the floor, you will be assaulted by different people and things. Enemies encountered will depend on which floor you are currently on. As you finish each Devil's Temple, the floors will get harder as the enemies become more numerous and quicker. The floors are broken up like this :


1ST FLOOR : This floor just has Grippers and Knife Throwers. They do become more numerous the more Temples you successfully complete.


2ND FLOOR : This floor has a few different enemies to deal with.

1) You will be assaulted by vases and confetti balls. If you do not destroy the vases before they hit the floor, they will release dragons or snakes. You can attempt to kick or punch the dragons, but it is risky since they blow fire from their mouths. This in addition to other enemies around you. As for the snakes, your only defense is to jump over them.

2) The confetti balls explode after a period of time sending shrapnel in all directions. These can be destroyed before they do any harm.

3) On the final part of the floor, you will deal with Grippers, Tom Toms, and Knife Throwers. (This is where the Tom Toms make their first appearance).


3RD FLOOR : This floor is like the first floor except now you will also have Tom Toms to deal with.


4TH FLOOR : This floor only has a couple of enemies to deal with.

1) At the beginning of the floor, Poisonous Moths will be released from the walls. They will come at Thomas randomly high, medium, or low. That means you will have to do some fancy footwork to either avoid them or take them out.

2) After the Poisonous Moths, the rest of the floor is the usual Grippers, Tom Toms, and Knife Throwers.


5TH FLOOR : Just like the 3rd floor except the Knife Throwers come out more frequently now.


* Defeating The Bosses : There are five bosses to deal with in this game. For most of the bosses, if you can back them up against the stairs and start pounding on them, you will defeat them very quickly. Of course, some bosses won't work with you in that area so you have to try other methods.


1) STICK FIGHTER : His claim to fame is that he has a big stick and he doesn't speak at all. This is one of the easier bosses to take down.

a) You can tell when he is ready to strike because he cocks his arm back to swing. Just move or jump back to avoid being hit.

b) You can crowd him against the stairs. Once you have done that, use a series of low sweeps to finish him off.

c) You can also take him out be doing jump kicks on him but that is a little more tricky since he can get a hit on you if you are not ready.


2) BOOMERANG FIGHTER : This guy likes to hit you coming and going. He throws two boomerangs at Thomas. If Thomas avoids them on the trip out, he may get hit on the return trip.

a) Your first priority is avoiding the boomerangs (of course). Most of the time, he throws the boomerangs mid or high so you can easily duck. Sometimes he will throw some low shots so you have to jump.

b) Once he releases his boomerangs, get up to him and let loose with kicks and punches. Prepare for the boomerangs return trip and once he catches them, hit him a couple of more times.

c) You should only have to do this cycle a couple of times before the Boomerang Fighter is no more.


3) GIANT : He stands about twice as tall as Thomas. Plus, he packs a mean wallop both in his punch and kick.

a) Although he is built like a tank, he is not very quick. Thomas can get in about three shots to his one. The problem is, when the Giant hits Thomas, a lot of energy loss occurs.

b) Don't even try to go toe-to-toe with this guy or you will lose. The best attacks are the jump kick and low sweep. You just have to watch out for his kick on the low sweep.

c) This one may take a while since you need to be careful around the giant.


4) BLACK MAGICIAN : Of course, no Devil's Temple would be complete without the resident Black Magician to annoy you. The Black Magician is one of the stranger bosses you have to deal with. His claim to fame is a couple of things. First, he creates duplicates of himself so you don't know which one is the real Black Magician. Second, he sometimes sends creatures after you such as bats to make your life miserable. Fortunately, the Black Magician is one of the easier bosses to deal with.

a) You need to back him up to the stairs as quickly as possible to limit his movement. If the Black Magician has a lot of room, he can create duplicates which will hurt Thomas.

b) Once you've backed him against the stairs, the only thing that will work on the Black Magician are low punches. When you have him backed against the stairs and are pounding on him, he can't create duplicates or other critters to harass Thomas.


5) MR. X : Well, you've finally made it to Mr. X. This will be a test of all of your Kung-Fu skills. Mr. X is no pushover. In addition, Mr. X regenerates his energy so you have to be quick about taking him down or he will fully regenerate.

a) You will notice that Mr. X has his own series of Kung-Fu moves that could very well do severe damage to Thomas. You will need to use different combos to get through Mr. X's defenses.

b) If he seems to block a particular attack, quickly switch to another. For example, if he blocks a low sweep, change it to a jump kick and you may get a shot in. Also, use your punches after getting his defenses away with kicks.

c) This will be a long battle but if you continue using different attacks, you can take him down.


6) Once Mr. X is beaten, you walk forward to kiss Silvia. Jump at the last minute and you'll walk a few extra steps and kiss thin air.

Lady Bug (c) 1981 Universal.


In Lady Bug you guide a bug through a "Pac-Man" style maze, eating dots, and avoiding monsters. Collect letters to spell EXTRA for a bonus life (just like in "Mr. Do!"), and SPECIAL for an extra credit. The maze has rotating doors which are just enough to give the game a slightly different feel than the Pac-Man series.

A proper Lady Bug arcade machine will be in a dedicated cabinet (specifically one of the ultra-curvy early Universal ones, "Mr. Do!", and many others used this same cabinet). Most games from Universal had no specific side art, just a painted 'Universal' logo, and a couple of colored stripes. This makes it possible to actually convert one Universal title into another one, without any loss in value. The joystick is mounted in the center of the control panel. Finally, this game uses a standard resolution monitor mounted vertically.

- SCORING -


Eating a flower : 10 points x score multiplier value.

Collecting a heart : 100 points x score multiplier value.

Collecting a yellow letter : 300 points x score multiplier value.

Collecting a red letter : 800 points x score multiplier value.

Bonus vegetable : 1,000 points for the cucumber on level one, increasing by 500 points per level, up to a maximum value of 9,500 for the horseradish on level 18 onwards.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Use the swing doors to block off the bugs' pursuit. Quickly flip a door as you pass it when a bug is behind you and as long as the bug is not too close, its route will be blocked and it will then have to find an alternative route to you. If the bug is too close it will go through the door behind you and there may be no escape.


* Try to collect bonus vegetables when there are still skulls available on the maze. If another bug dies, when it leaves the base another vegetable will appear. This is the key to high scores on later levels when the vegetables are worth anything up to 9,500 points each.


* Get the score multiplier up to x5 as soon as possible. All points on the maze except bonus vegetables will then be multiplied by 5. You should get the hearts before getting ANY letters. The exception is when one of the letters is only 2 spaces above the enemy bugs' base, and waiting for it to turn red may prove fatal. Alternatively you can try to collect a letter in this position when the bugs are frozen, when you have a few seconds to wait around for it to change.


* Collect all unneeded letters when they are red with the multiplier on x5 for 4,000 points each. For example if you already have the "X" for EXTRA collect it again when it is on red x5.


* Clear the flowers around the bugs' base at the start of each level from stage 5 onwards. This is especially important past stage 10 when the bugs speeds is much increased. You do not move any faster, and will need to have a good knowledge of the maze layout to avoid them.


* Use the swing doors to force the bugs to go where you want them to. Example: stay to the upper right of the bugs' base, and let them come to you. When they are close, move the door so they have to pass your position, and when they are past you move the door again, so that they have to go the long way round to get to you again. Wait until all four bugs are out and then you can get the bonus vegetable when the way is clear. Watch out though, as some breeds of bug are particularly studid (or smart) and will not follow the route you want, but will lurk near you to try and trap you.


* Try to group all 4 bugs close together to increase your chances of getting the bonus vegetable.


* If you quickly flip the same revolving door several times in succession you will notice you move part way through it. You can now walk through this door without spinning it. Useful if you want to wait somewhere and make a getaway without moving the door.

- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1997.


This game is known in Japan as "Bakumatsu Roman - Gekka no Kenshi" (translates from Japanese as 'Bakumatsu Romance - Swordsman In The Moonlight'), and in Korea as "The Last Soldier".


Parts of Gekka no Kenshi was based off of the manga 'Rurouni Kenshin'.


The Bakumatsu period of Japan (1860-1899) represents the opening of Japanese ports to foreigners. The Last Blade is set during this time period and you can see Europeans in some backgrounds, as well as some European dress influences on some characters.


This game has a lot to do with Japanese religion. In what little understanding of Japanese culture, there are four gods in Japanese mythology : Seiryuu (blue dragon), Suzaku (red phoenix), Byakko (white tiger) and Genbu. Each god is associated with a direction : Byakko with west, Seiryuu with east, Genbu with north and Suzaku in the south. The four gods also seem to be portrayed in an identical manner : Suzaku is often seen as a renegade of sorts, Genbu is often wise, Byakko seems to be strong and Seiryuu seems to be the role of the protagonist. To this end, the four characters that are avatars to these gods in Gekka no Kenshi (Kaede, Okina, Shigen and Kagami) seem to fit the gods themselves to a tee (Kaede to Seiryuu, Okina to Genbu, Shigen to Byakko and Kagami to Suzaku). However, there may be one (unintentional) reference to the entire fighting game itself. These four characters may very well represent the four popular styles of characters found in nearly fighting game :

Kaede is a Shotokan-style character. This type of character, of course, is the earliest type of fighting game character (as early fighting games always had the protagonist be proficient in some form of karate). However, ever since the release of "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", a Shoto-character refers to a character with similar moves to that of Ryu and Ken from that game, or more specifically, a character with a projectile and a built upper. Kaede fits this property well : his Ittou Hayate is a projectile (much like Ryu's Hadou Ken) and his Ittou Kuuga is a built upper (like Ken's Shoryuu Ken). Of course, Kaede may also be a nod to that of SNK's first fighting game protagonist (Terry Bogard) as well : his Kasshin Fukuryuu super is in the style of Terry's Power Geyser. To this day, many fighting game characters are known as Shoto characters - their simplicity can't be beat.

Shigen is a large character. Large characters come generally in two flavors : the power character and the grappler (Shigen himself is a mix of both). Power characters generally don't move much but deal lots of damage per hit. Grapplers are those whose special moves are mainly throws. These characters tend to last longer because of their size, but have a weakness that they have either short range or are slow (or, in the case of some characters, overly complicated moves).

Okina may be described as a turtler. This may seem like an inside joke (Okina, in his profile, refers to his family as a bunch of turtles), but it sometimes make sense.

Jokes aside, turtlers are not exactly a type of character, but a type of player. That is, a turtler is a player who tend to block attacks a lot.

Charge characters (i.e. those whose repertoire of moves are mainly charge moves) generally fall into this category, as it is often that they need to remain in a blocking position in order to get their charges and counterattack.

Over the years, there have been many incentives to stray away from this style (as well as derivatives thereof, such as ticking), such as guard breaks, overheads, low attacks, shorter charges and unblockable moves.

Granted, the turtler is not as big as a factor as it used to be (the most popular character in "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" was Guile because of his turtling and ticking abilities), but Okina's reference to turtles remains.

Kagami, of course, continues SNK's tradition of making cheap-ass characters for final bosses.


Akari and Juzoh are the comedic relief characters in the Gekka series : Juzoh is seen in Akari's stage if Akari is fighting (and obviously, if Akari is not fighting Juzoh). Likewise, Akari can be seen in Juzoh's stage if Juzoh is fighting (and if Juzoh isn't fighting against Akari).

Released in November 1998.


This game is known in Japan as "Bakumatsu Roman Dai Ni Maku - Gekka no Kenshi : Tsuki ni Saku Hana, Chiri Yuku Hana" (translates from Japanese as 'Bakumatsu Romance Episode II - Swordsman in the Moonlight : The Flower That Blossoms In The Moon, The Flower That Turns To Dust').


Kojiroh Sanada is a homage to an ancient Chinese legend about a girl disguising herself as her father (the same story was also used in the Disney movie Mulan).


Lee Rekka is a homage to the Cantonese hero, Wong Fei Hung.


Akari and Juzoh are the comedic relief characters in the Gekka series : If Akari is fighting someone other than Juzoh, Juzoh can be seen next to the elephant. If Akari is fighting Juzoh, Akari's three friends (Hijiri Nanase, Aoi Yahata and Shizuka Kujou) can be seen next to the elephant. If Juzoh is fighting someone other than Akari, Akari can be seen with her friends.


Pony Canyon released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Bakumatsu Roman The Second Act Gekka no Kenshi - Flowers Blooming on the Moon, Flowers Scattering on the Wind - PCCB-00350) on 18/12/1998.


- UPDATES -


In the original (Japanese) version of Last Blade 2, each of the 3 modes is described by one kanji : Chikara (red), Waza (blue) and Kiwame (green). Chikara means 'strength', Waza 'skill' and Kiwame 'extreme'.

These 3 modes were made into 'Power', 'Speed' and 'EX', respectively, for their English release.

However, one case where the modes were literally translated remain.

If you look at the English 'How To Play' intro in Last Blade 2, you will see 'Strength and Skill' where they should have said 'Power and Speed'.

A slight mistake in the English renaming, or a tribute to the Japanese and therefore correct, names.

Lazer Command (c) 10/1976 Meadows Games.


You have an overhead view of a maze with two sides, the sides mirror each other. The left side of the screen is yellow, and the right side is green. On each side are fifteen tanks. The object is to blow up all of the oppossing players tanks (or as many as you can before the timer runs out). You can only control one tank at a time, you can move them around and blast your opponents tanks (getting the active one is usually a good idea). When you get blasted, your tank vanishes, and you must move a little blip over to another tank to resume play (this blip is invisible unless it is against a wall). You can also leave your tank and head for another one by pressing the second button. This is just a great strategic title, it holds up even today. It is really worth playing if you like that sort of thing. Just be aware that this is a two player only title, so you will need a friend to play against.

Lazer Command had one ugly cabinet. It was just a big yellow box without any curves or angles at all. The control panel had two large 4-Way joysticks, that each had two fire buttons, these did not have a ball on top or anything like that, they were kind of like bicycle handgrips with fire buttons. The machine had sticker style sideart, which was a circle with an explosion inside that said 'Lazer Command'. The marquee was rather plain, and was simply labeled with the title in red letters, while the monitor bezel had detailed game instructions printed on it. The monitor was a black and white monochrome model with a green and yellow overlay.

League Bowling (c) 1990 SNK.


A colourful and playable ten-pin bowling game for 1 to 4 players, offering a choice of three scoring methods : 'Regulation', 'Flash' and 'Strike 90'.


The game begins with players selecting either a right or left-handed bowler, before choosing what weight they want their bowling balls to be. Once the match starts properly, Power and Direction meters will appear and players must use both their judgement and timing to select and execute the desired bowl. Timing is key as players are only allowed twenty seconds to make each shot.


The 'Strike 90' mode awards players ninety points for a strike and sixty points for a spare. In the 'Flash' game mode, the points flash across the lane as the players throw the ball. Should they succeed in knocking down the standing pins, the points that are displayed at the time the pins are struck will be added to the players' scores.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* On each level, a trio of statues arranged in a triangular pattern will appear about three-quarters of the way through. Bomb them until one of them reveals a passageway (you'll have to bomb them all; it's not the same one every time), and fly into it. You'll now be in a cave, free to fly along and collect treasure chests worth 200 points apiece. When you're in the cave, though, don't shoot - if you fire and hit a treasure chest it's destroyed, and some of the cavern walls release enemies when shot.


* A mouth's stage bug : At the final of each stage inside of the statue's mouth, you have to go upstairs to face a stage boss. You can avoid to confront him directly. To achieve this, go upstairs and walk slowly approximately to the middle of the platform.  The music will change to the boss theme. Go back downstairs and stay on the middle platform. Keep shooting the screen at the opposite direction of the boss. He will be defeated in seconds this way, without any risk for your character.

Lifeforce (c) 1986 Konami.


A 1 or 2-player sequel to 1985's superb shoot-em-up, "Nemesis". While it retained the same basic gameplay and feel of its predecessor, it featured both superior graphics and a more imaginative approach to level design. The earliest example of the latter appears towards the end of the very first level, in which imposing, organic obstructions grow before the players' eyes. The game's 3rd level - the infamous 'lava' level - is another good example of Lifeforce's superb design; with huge solar flares constantly erupting both above and below the player's ship that must be carefully navigated to avoid instant loss of life. This game also introduced further variety to the action with the introduction vertically-scrolling levels, which alternated with the standard side-scrolling levels.

- UPDATES -


Salamander, the original Japanese release, was originally a spin-off of "Gradius", but with a simplified power-up system and overhead stages.

Lifeforce, the US release, is just like the Japanese original only with slightly different color palettes.

Lifeforce, the Japanese re-release, has more organic looking graphics and adopts the "Gradius" power-up system.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Bypass the mini-boss in stage 6 : In stage 6 (Zelos's fortress if you're playing Salamander or the brain area if you're playing Life Force), there is a mini-boss section consisting of multiple boss ships that fire sets of 4 lasers. Move your ship all the way to the top of the screen and you will be safe until this section ends. This glitch does not work in the Japanese re-release version of the game (the one with a purple background in attract mode).

Released in May 1990.


This game is known in Japan as "Trigon".


King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Collection Vol.2 - KICA-1016) on 21/08/1990.


- UPDATES -


In Lightning Fighters (World) and Trigon (Japan) there are different ''rules'' depending on whether you start the game with one or two players. In a one-player game, you start with no bombs, and when you die the game restarts you at a checkpoint. In a two-player game, each life starts with one bomb, and when you die you respawn in place. There are some powerups that only appear in a two-player game and one that only appears in a one-player game. The game type cannot be changed once the game starts. A second player cannot join an originally one-player game; conversely, if one player dies in a two-player game the game remains in two-player mode and the second player can rejoin at any time.


In Lightning Fighters (US), even if you start a one-player game, the game is always in two-player mode: you respawn in place when you die and you start each life with one bomb stocked. This means that a second player can join midway into a one-player game. Unfortunately it also means that the powerup that only appears in one-player games in the other versions, does not appear at all in the US version. Also, it has the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.

Liquid Kids (c) 09/1990 Taito.


A incredibly cute and colourful single player platform game from the same stable that brought the classic "Bubble Bobble", "New Zealand Story" and "Rainbow Islands" to the gaming world. Liquid Kids features 'Hipopo the Hippo', a Hippopotamus who must fight his way through a large number of enemy-packed levels in search of his missing girlfriend - rescuing other hippo-like creatures along the way. Hipopo is armed with magical water globes which can be thrown at enemies to freeze and damage them. Once frozen, the enemies can then be kicked and destroyed completely. The water attack works in a very similar fashion to the water attack bubbles of another Taito classic, 1986's "Bubble Bobble". 


The level design is superb and makes full use of the game's water theme; with moving platforms, collapsible floors, boats and water-wheels all making an appearance. Small plants also appear on certain levels which can be ''watered'', causing them to grow and creating new platforms.

* On early stages aways go for the bonus stations, as they yield the biggest points score during normal gameplay.


* If a bonus station timer is getting low, don't go for it unless you are 100% sure you will make it. It's not worth risking a life for a 20 point bonus!


* Learn to move the track quickly, as this is the key to getting your train to its desired target. You should be able to move a piece of track 3 or 4 times while your train is still on it, moving at normal speed.


* If you have a long route opened up in front of you, run it at full speed, but remember it takes a couple of seconds at the end for your train to slow to its normal speed.


* When your train is moving along a long route try to plan where it will go next by moving pieces your train has already passed over and maybe even swapping some of those around ahead of you to change your route.

Released in July 1984.


Licensed to Irem for manufacture and production.


The Bungeling Empire, made famous in the Lode Runner series, is also the antagonist in "Vs. Raid On Bungeling Bay". Both games were developed by Broderbund Software.


Here is the full story of the game from one of the makers : The person most responsible for the development of Lode Runner was Doug Smith. He and I both lived with our parents in Renton, Washington, and commuted to school at the University of Washington in Seattle. Doug attempted to get into the Computer Science Department twice before settling on a Physics major. Later, I was accepted to the Computer Science Department, but guess which one of us became a millionaire. Doug eventually dropped out of college in the wake of Lode Runner's success.


The earliest version of Lode Runner was written in Fortran on the University's VAX 1. It was called 'Kong' because of its similarities to "Donkey Kong". Since developing video games was not authorized use of the University's resources, it was known as 'graph' until its completion. 'graph' would prompt the user for a function, then crap out unless the secret password was entered to play 'Kong'. The secret password became common knowledge among students, so a 'show process' command would often report 80% of the users running 'graph'.


The only coauthor of 'Kong' was James Bratsanos (or something like that, I never met him). He contributed about 15% of the total man hours to the development of the Fortran version and 0% to later versions.


'Kong' worked on ASCII terminals. The bricks were solid block characters, the player was a dollar sign, and the bad guys were paragraph symbols. A paragraph symbol is basically a backwards capitol P with a double vertical line. Everyone thought they looked like cobras, and referred to them as snakes. The player bounced along rapidly and was hard to control. You had to hit the space bar to make him stop moving.


The next version was called 'Miner'. It was developed in Doug's bedroom in 6502 Assembly Language on an Apple II+ borrowed from Mark Ledbury. It was also Mark who prodded Doug to finish the game. Doug originally wanted to keep the bad guys as snakes, slithering around the screen. The most notorious 'feature' of this version is the lack of inter-square animation. Doug had stolen the four frame running man sequence from Dan Gorlin's "Choplifter" game, but still moved the man by leaps and bounds around the screen. It looked like he was ice skating.


Doug submitted 'Miner' to four video game marketing companies : Broderbund, Electronic Arts, Sirius Software and Epyx. Broderbund offered him an advance of $10,000 and 23% royalties on gross sales. One of the others offered him $100,000 flat. He made the right choice : Broderbund, of course. Doug blamed Sirius for leaking a copy of Miner which was widely distributed in southern California.


Broderbund gave him the advance with no strings attached other than he couldn't market it elsewhere. To get the royalties, he would have to complete the game to their satisfaction. This included the addition of inter-square animation, sound effects, and a new title page for a new name : Lode Runner. He would also have to deliver on the 150 screens he had promised.


With new incentive, Doug worked around the clock, dropping his classes for the quarter (Spring, 1983). He wasn't creative enough to think of 150 screens (he had about 30), so he let the neighborhood kids come over and design screens with the screen editor. He paid the kids on a per screen basis for every one that ended up in the final release. The game was ready by Summer of 1983.


Broderbund had an ex Walt Disney animator working in-house. For a cut of the profits, he would design a nice title page. Doug took him up on his offer. An in-house programmer, Dane Bingham, provided the Commodore C64 conversion and perhaps others. Doug worked on the conversion for the Atari 800 conversion himself. I'm not sure if he finished it. A Japanese company even made a little known arcade version with horrible sound. Doug offered James Bratsanos a flat payment for his role in the development of the Fortran version. James was surprised to receive anything at all, and accepted.


Doug's royalties started pouring in. He broke Dan Gorlin's Broderbund record of $77,000 in one month royalties. The last I heard, he had grossed 2 million dollars in total royalties. Apparently, he didn't get very good tax advice, because he paid about half of it to the IRS. With his net profits, Doug bought at Porsche 911 Carrera, a Bayliner speedboat, a house in Issaquah, and a wife (as a colleague once joked).


With the money going out so fast, Doug realized that he didn't have enough to retire on. He started his own company called QAD. It stood for Quick And Dirty, but he was prepared to say Quality And Diversity if he felt someone couldn't handle the real name. He and his two partners, Chip Bulkeley and Mark Ledbury soon began another project named Ralph. It was to be one of the first video games to utilize double-hires Apple II hardware. Mark just did the graphics. Chip ended up doing more work than Doug and insisted on renegotiating their split before proceeding. The project became more and more overdue and was eventually scrapped. Doug went back to making new and improved versions of Lode Runner, his bread and butter. I haven't heard from him since.


Although Broderbund is now owned by Mattel Interactive, Mr. Smith still owns the rights to Lode Runner.

Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (R-Type : Irem Game Music - 28XA-199) on 25/01/1988.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* If you finish a level in less than half of the time, the time bonus is multiplied by 2.


* If you do not kill any enemy during a level, a 10,000 points bonus is granted.


* If you do not make any enemy fall in a hole during a level, a 20,000 points bonus is granted!


* If during a fall, you land on an enemy, you do not lose but obtain 1,000 points.


* Easter egg : there is a hidden monster from the next block on every level where digging is allowed (some levels have only stone, thus, the blaster cannot make holes). The monster can be uncovered by blasting the dirt that it is hiding in. Once it is uncovered, it will join in persuing the player. If it is entrapped, it will leave behind a bonus of 3,000 to 8,000 points. Its entrappment will not count against the 20,000 entrappment bonus.

Lost Tomb (c) 01/1982 Stern Electronics.


A shoot-em-up set in an ancient, South American pyramid, in which the player must explore a large number of single rooms in the search for treasure. Each room is filled with enemy creatures that must be killed or avoided. The player is equipped with a limited amount of whips and must collect as many items of treasure as possible.


The player is presented with options throughout the game, depending upon which rooms they wish to enter. Once a path is chosen, players must pick up treasures, kill all the monsters in their way, find the key and exit the room as fast as they can; avoiding the potential of setting off an earthquake. Upon exiting a level, the player is presented with a hallway which shows a number of doorways allowing access to any one of several different rooms. This allows players to pick their own route through the game, but the decision which room to tackle next must be taken quickly as players must reach their chosen room quickly or risk being attacked by a flock of screeching birds.


The player's character is armed with an eight-way firing gun (in a similar fashion to Williams' 1982 classic, "Robotron"). In addition to the gun, the player is also equipped with three whips, which can be used to either kill attacking creatures or to knock down any walls that bar the player's progress. Players are given the opportunity to purchase additional whips at the interludes between levels; this is done by inserting an extra credit into the arcade machine and pressing the relevant button.


Treasure must be constantly collected in order to stay alive.

A bargain for those intent on serious playing, but also an indication of how expensive this machine could prove to be.

Lot Lot (c) 1985 Tokuma Shoten.


In Lot Lot, you directly control one arrow and indirectly control another which follows after your original arrow with a (roughly) 4-second delay. When you press the button, any balls on the compartment that one arrow points to are immediately swapped with the contents of the compartment that the other arrow points to. The goal of Lot Lot is to get as many tiny balls (which resemble Pachinko balls) out of grid compartments and down into point slots in order to achieve a designated score, and advance to the next round.

Lunar Lander (c) 1979 Atari.


Lunar Lander is a 1-player coin-op electronic game that simulates landing a manned spaceship on the moon. Various video-display phrases indicate score, time elapsed during this landing mission, fuel units consumed, altitude above the moon, and horizontal and vertical speed. The fuel consumption and both speed readings are important for the player to determine how to land the craft. Realistic engine rumble and crash sounds accompany game play. A high beep warns of an almost-depleted fuel supply, whereupon players can add coins to automatically extend the game and 'fill up' their fuel tanks. Depending on the quality of the landing or the crash, various messages are displayed on the screen.


Game play begins with engine rumble and the lander drifting towards the bottom

right corner of the screen. Horizontal and vertical speeds are constantly displayed, including two arrows to show horizontal and vertical directions of travel. Altitude is measured in distance above the surface of the mountain - not above 'sea level'. The screen also shows time in actual seconds, representing time elapsed in the current mission.


The operator can select from 4 different settings for fuel units - 450, 600, 750 or 900 fuel units per coin (free play is also available). As the lander module flies over the landscape, it approaches the mountains and a landing site. At a certain point near the mountains, the game 'zooms in' for a close-up view of everything on the screen.


If the player realizes the speed is too fast and the landing looks hopeless, he or she can press the ABORT button on the control panel. This will give the lander extra thrust and make it fly upwards at top speed. The abort feature does consume 120 to 180 fuel units, though, as a disincentive to overusing it. If the ABORT button is pressed too late, however, a crash cannot be avoided.


The 4 levels of mission difficulty are determined by the player and can be changed at any time during the game or the ready-to-play mode. The differences between the 4 are printed on the mission select panels and are self explanatory, except perhaps rotational momentum. This feature causes the lander to tumble around when either ROTATE button is pushed. The longer either button is held down, the faster the lander module will spin in that direction. The player gains control of the lander by pressing the other ROTATE button for the same amount of time.


- TECHNICAL -


Lunar Lander came in a large black upright cabinet, which was a little heavier than most. The sideart is a (predominately blue); there is no front art at all, and the monitor bezel is relatively clear of decals. The marquee features a 'Lunar Lander' blasting off from the surface of the moon (some of these have a black background, while others have blue, it appears that there were 2 print runs of these).

- TRIVIA -


Released in August 1979. Approximately 4830 Uunits were produced. Original price was $1,695.


Licensed to Sega for Japan market.


Atari's first vector game. "Lunar Lander", was inspired by "Moonlander", a game written by Jack Burness in 1973 as a demo for the DEC GT40 vector graphics terminal (based on a PDP-11/05 CPU). This game used a light pen to control thrust and rotation.


If the player landed at exactly the right spot, a McDonalds appeared. The astronaut would leave the lander and walk over to the McDonalds and order a Big Mac to go, before walking back to the Lander and taking off again. If players crashed directly into the McDonalds, the game displayed a message reading 'You clod. You've destroyed the only McDonald's on the Moon.' After a short run of Lunar Lander machines were manufactured, production was shifted over to "Asteroids" and the first few hundred Asteroids machines were housed in Lunar Lander cabinets. Atari donated a gold edition version of the coin-operated video game to the Discovery Center of Science & Technology in Syracuse, New York.


On 17 June 1980, Atari's "Asteroids" and "Lunar Lander" were the first two video games to ever be registered in the Copyright Office.


Michael Mize holds the official record for this game with 3,470 points.


A Lunar Lander units appears in the 1984 movie 'The Philadelphia Experiment'.


- UPDATES -


Revision 1 :  DIP switches allow 450, 600, 750, or 900 fuel units per coin.


Revision 2 :  DIP switches allow 450, 600, 750, 900, 1100, 1300, 1500, or 1800 fuel units per coin.


- SCORING -


The scoring system gives 50 points for a good landing, plus 50 fuel units as a bonus. A hard landing earns only 15 points, and a crash earns 5 points. A crash happens when the vertical speed exceeds 15 and the horizontal speed exceeds 31. The number displayed after SCORE is cumulative of all landings made in the current game. The point scores for a good or hard landing can be greatly increased by landing on an area with a flashing multiplier, for example 2X or 5X. Thus, a good landing on the very narrow 5X site would give that player 250 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your Lunar Lander will be floating above the moon's surface. Immediately, your lander will start to descend. Figure out where you want to land and maneuver your lander to that landing pad. Fuel is a valuable commodity in this game. To get the most ''bang'' for your quarter, try to use as little as possible. Since everything burns fuel (even rotating your lander left and right), do your best to get centered over a landing pad so you don't have to overreact at the last minute.


* Use the thrust lever sparingly. It is easy to move it up and down so you can easily put on full thrusters before you realize what's happening. This can be especially dangerous if you are in a canyon and are going sideways. Your lander will become part of the moonscape very quickly. Just use short bursts to correct your downward and left/right movement. This not only gives you better control, but it also saves you on fuel.


* After you have decided on the landing pad, start maneuvering your lander toward it. Use minimal thrusters to keep your lander from going too fast toward the moon. Also, only tap on the right and left rotation buttons so that you keep your left/right speed as near to zero as possible.


* When you get near enough to the moon's surface, the view will change and you will get the close-up view. This is the time you can start doing all your finishing maneuvers. If you set yourself up right when you were way above the moon's surface, you shouldn't have to do much to ensure that you are over the landing pad. If you find yourself in trouble and there is no way out, press the ABORT button. The effects are that it automatically straightens out your lander, stops all left/right movement, and moves you a little ways off the surface. The penalty for this is approximately 100 units of fuel.


* On your final descent onto the landing pad, watch your speed. If you land at anything greater then 10, you run the risk of damaging or destroying your lander. When you have landed, the game will give you an assessment of the landing and the points earned.


* Over time, the easy pads will go away and you will have to land on pads located on the sides of mountains or very deep, steep sided ravines. It will be even more critical that you know how to do small maneuvers since some of the landing pads are not wider then your lander.

You then either must release your lander or after a pre-determined period of time, the mother ship will forcibly eject it. You first have to navigate through 6 rows of asteroids to make it to one of the landing platforms. You have 6 platforms initially but each landing will eliminate one since there is 1 platform per astronaut you have to rescue. On your return trip up, the screen changes and now you have saucers trying to destroy you with laser fire. Again, you will either have 3 or 6 rows of saucers depending if there are meteors in the area. You then must successfully land in the docking bay of the mother ship to get credit for a successful rescue of 1 astronaut.

- TRIVIA -


Released in February 1980. Also released as a Cocktail model : "T.T Lunar Rescue".


This game is also known as "Galaxy Rescue".


Lunar Rescue was the follow-up game to "Space Invaders". Unfortunately, it was released at the same time as "Asteroids", which pretty much eclipsed most games until the 1980's. Lunar Rescue is actually a little more complicated then its Space Invaders cousin. You actually have to keep track of a few more things to successfully make it through this game. This is one of those 'sleeper' games that didn't get a big following since Asteroids was also out.


Before stage 4, you get a cute intermission from the aliens of "Space Invaders" telling you to 'Fight'.


A bootleg of this game was made by Model Racing.

A bootleg of this game is known as "Destination Earth".


A Lunar Rescue unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High'.


- UPDATES -


In "Destination Earth" the humans run to the spaceship after it lands, in Lunar Rescue and "Galaxy Rescue" the pace is more like a walk.


- SCORING -


Large Saucer : 30 points

Small Saucer: 50 points

Platform : 50, 100, 150 points


Each man rescued has an increasing value until stage four where it is at its maximum. The values are :

Stage 1 : 50 points

Stage 2 : 100 points

Stage 3 : 150 points

Stage 4 : 300 points

Every stage after stage 4 is 300 points.


Fuel remaining is added to your score (i.e. if you have 560 Fuel left, then add 560 points to your score) at the end of a wave.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your lander will be sitting in the docking bay of the mother ship. You can release your lander by pressing the firing button or wait until the mother ship forcibly ejects you. It's better to do it yourself lest the mother ship ejects you on top of an asteroid.


* Fuel is a precious commodity in this game, use it sparingly. You only have 800 units of fuel to rescue 6 men. If you burn all your fuel off on the first rescue, you will have nothing to fall back on for the other 5.


* When you leave the mother ship, try to navigate through the asteroids without using any fuel. Since your lander doesn't accelerate during the fall, you will be going at a constant speed down. Try to maneuver between the rocks to land on a platform. You also don't need to decelerate when landing, you just land.


* Try to knock out the harder platforms first. This mean that this is land on the harder to reach ones first on the sides. A good strategy is to get the right hand-one first, then the two left-hand ones, then finish by landing on the three in the middle.


* If you must use fuel, use quick bursts to get into position to land on a platform. Fuel burns up very quickly in this game so some quick shots to the thrusters should keep you out of trouble. Keep in mind, as the waves progress, the asteroids move faster and become more numerous.


* Once you've landed, the little guy will run over and get in your lander. The screen will then change and you will see 3 to 6 rows of saucers blocking your path. Again, as the waves progress, the saucers and meteors get faster and more numerous. There are a couple of different strategies for this section :

1) If you only see 3 lower rows of saucers, look to the upper right or left corner. More then likely, some meteors will be coming diagonally down to the opposite corner. The best solution is to quickly blast a path through the saucers and get above the meteors trajectory.

2) If you see 6 rows of saucers, then you need to blast a path through them to get to your mother ship. Keep in mind that the fire button acts as a dual fire/thrust button. When you fire, you accelerate yourself up just a bit. In other words, no point blank shooting or you may end up taking out the saucer with your lander. When you have cleared a path, use the fire button to get yourself quickly above the saucers.


* The saucers firing just drop their shots on you. Because of their numbers, you may find yourself surrounded by enemy fire. The best solution is again to blast a path through them. Once a saucer is destroyed, it doesn't come back. Also keep in mind that you can only have one shot on the screen at a time.


* Once you get 1 row from the bottom of the mother ship, it will stop and open its docking bay door. If you are too far away, you will fail to dock with the mother ship and get destroyed by the top of the screen. If you hit the side of the mother ship, the man you are rescuing will unfortunately fall from your lander to his death to the planet below. Plan out the best strategy to make sure that you stay in the middle so you can catch the mother ship with minimal effort.

- TRIVIA -


Released in April 1980.


Also released as a Cocktail model : "T.T Lupin III".


Based, sort of, on Lupin III, one of the most famous manga/anime series of all time. Lupin is a descendant of Arsene Lupin, a thief who was the main character of mystery novels written by Maurice LeBlanc. Monkey Punch (Katou Kazuhiko), Lupin III's creator, used the Lupin name without permission, and the estate of LeBlanc agreed not to raise too much of a fuss so long as Lupin III remained in Japan. This is why early US/European releases of Lupin titles changed his name to things like 'The Wolf' and 'Rupan'. The copyrights to the Arsene Lupin name have since passed into the public domain.


The Lupin III manga began in 1967, running in Manga Action. The first TV series began in 1971, and ran for 23 episodes. A second TV series began in 1977, and ran for 155 episodes. The first animated Lupin III movie (there had already been an old black-and-white live-action movie) was Lupin Vs. The Clones (more commonly known to US/European audiences as 'Mystery of Mamo') came out in 1978, and was followed in 1979 by the most famous animated version of Lupin, The Castle of Cagliostro. Footage from these two movies were used to make the laserdisc game Cliff Hanger. So Lupin was at the height of his popularity when this game was released.

Also released as "M.A.C.H. 3 [Cockpit model]".


M.A.C.H. stands for 'Military Air Command Hunter'.


In order to record the video footage for the game, a specially designed plane was used that had cameras mounted on the nose and in the belly. To keep the video from the laser disc player and computer graphics in sync, target data had to be entered by hand one frame at a time on the right audio track of the laser disc. This was a very time consuming process but was worth the effort, as M.A.C.H. 3 was one of the most successful laser disc games of all time.


King Brown holds the official record for this game with 348,800 points.

Mad Planets (c) 1983 Gottlieb.


In Mad Planets, the player takes control of a spaceship and must attempt to destroy a series of Earth-like planets which emerge from the center of the screen and rapidly move towards the player's ship - increasing in size as they do so. Destroying all of the planets in a round before the they reach their full scale will see the player awarded with bonus points. Fully-grown planets are orbited by a number of small moons, which, if destroyed, cause the planet to go 'mad' - turning red and making a beeline for the player's ship. The game also includes bonus rounds in which stranded astronauts can be rescued for additional points.

The control panel consists of 1 or 2 player select buttons, a joystick with fire button and one rotary encoder (spinner) for rotating the ship. The players ship is moved vertically, horizontally or diagonally by the joystick. The ship can be rotated 360 degrees by the rotary dial. The fire button is a trigger styled switch located on the joystick.


- TRIVIA -


Released in February 1983. Approximately 1,500 units were produced.


At the time of Mad Planets, most video games did not include the designers names, as many companies feared that well-known designers would be lured away by competitors. This policy approached ridiculous heights in an April 1983 Videogames magazine interview with Davis, Thiel and Lee. While designers from Williams were identified by name in the same issue, the Gottlieb trio was identified as D. Ziner, J. Walkman, and R. Teeste - due to the company's policy of keeping designers' names secret. While management continued to prevent employees from including their full names in a game, they DID eventually agree to a small compromise by allowing the use of their initials (or nicknames) for the game's default high scores. In Mad Planets, the default high score screen contains the identities of almost the entire Gottlieb video crew.


Jean Baudin holds the official record for this game with 507,710 points on August 12, 2001.


While Mad Planets, in its original form, was never ported across to any of the home machines of the time, a British programmer called Simon Nicol wrote an almost identical version called 'Crazy Comets', for the Commodore C64. It looked and played exactly like the arcade game that inspired it, but featured far superior music - written by industry legend, Rob Hubbard - which became celebrated in its own right.


- SCORING -


APPROACHING PLANETS : These planets first appear far in another galaxy and rapidly approach the players ship. They do not have moons orbiting around them. The player is awarded 100 points for destroying an Approaching Planet.


ATTACKING PLANET : A planet that has 3 to 6 moons orbiting around it. An attacking Planet seeks out and tries to destroy the players ship by colliding with the ship or releasing moons into space. An Attacking Planet cannot be destroyed until all of the orbiting moons have been destroyed (see MAD PLANET). An Attacking Planet scores 1 point when hit.


ORBITING MOON : These are moons that are in orbit around the Attacking Planet.  Destroying an Orbiting Moon awards 10 points.


MAD MOON : Any moon that leaves its original orbit around the planet and is free floating in space. These orange moons must be avoided or destroyed. Destroying a Mad Moon scores 100 points and is eliminated from the planet that released it. If the Mad Moon escapes the player and moves off the screen, it is replaced in its original orbit around the Attacking Planet.


MAD PLANET : Commencing with the destruction of all of the Orbiting Moons, an Attacking Planet transposes into a Mad Planet. A Mad Planet must be destroyed quickly as its vengeful quest to destroy the ship causes its movement to quicken rapidly. Mad Planets score dependent on its size :

Mad Plutona : 200 points.

Mad Marzon : 300 points.

Mad Kryptophan : 500 points.


COMETS : Comets first appear in the beginning of the third round and continue throughout the game. They travel indiscriminately around the planets and are deadly to the players ship. It must be avoided or destroyed. The first Comet destroyed awards 100 points. Every Comet destroyed in succession increments its value by 100 points up to 1000 points awarded for the tenth and all following Comets. However, if a Comet is allowed to leave the screen at any time during the round, the Comet values start over at 100 points and repeat the scoring sequence. This scoring sequence repeats at the beginning of each new round.


HUMANS : Humans first appear in the first Bonus Period (see BONUS PERIOD) and all subsequent rounds thereafter. Humans are picked up by the players ship by touching them with the ship. Points awarded for picking up Humans advances for each wave of game play. Starting with the second wave, Humans award 300 points each. This increments by 100 points for each subsequent wave to a maximum of 1000 points per Human in the ninth wave and remains at 1000 points for the remainder of the game. During a Bonus Period, all Humans score 200 points (see BONUS PERIOD).


BONUS PERIOD : A Bonus Period is achieved at the end of each wave (see ROUND PROGRESSION). During the Bonus Period only the players ship, Humans and Comets appear on the screen. The Player must pick up Humans to gain bonus points and avoid being hit by the Comet. The period ends when either the players ship is destroyed by a Comet, the Comet is allowed to leave the screen or ten Comets have been destroyed. Each Comet appearing (up to 10) must be destroyed for the Bonus Period to continue. Comets score 100 points for the first one destroyed and increment by 100 points for each subsequent Comet that is eliminated. All Humans score 200 points during the Bonus Period.


PERFECT ROUND : A Perfect Round is achieved by destroying all of the planets in a round while they are Approaching Planets. They must not be allowed to form into Attacking Planets and the players ship must not be destroyed. A Perfect Round awards the total number of Attacking Planets allowed to appear on the screen at one time for that round times 2000.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Game play is initiated when either the 1 player or 2 player buttons are pressed. As the round begins, Approaching Planets from a distant galaxy begin to approach the players ship. The player has the option of destroying the planets as they are approaching him. Successfully destroying all Approaching Planets in a round awards bonus points for a Perfect Round. When a planet is allowed to reach the players ships orbit, it reveals a group of moons orbiting around it. This becomes an Attacking Planet. An Attacking Planet cannot be destroyed until the player has destroyed all of its Orbiting Moons. Once all of the Orbiting Moons have been destroyed, the planet transposes into the Mad Planet destine to destroy the players ship. The Mad Planet must be destroyed quickly as it travels faster and faster the longer it remains in orbit.


Each round has a predetermined number of planets per round and a predetermined number of Attacking Planets to fight at one time (see ROUND PROGRESSIONS). Once an Attacking Planet is destroyed, another planet approaches. If not destroyed, it also will become an Attacking Planet. This cycle continues until there are no longer any planets to destroy in that round. Once all the planets have been destroyed, the game advances to the next round.


In defense to the players attack, the Attacking Planet will release one of its Orbiting Moons into space in an attempt to destroy the players ship. This orange moon must be avoided or destroyed. If the Mad Moon is allowed to leave the screen without being destroyed, it is replaced in its original orbit around the Attacking Planet that released it.


The Bonus Period appears at the end of each wave. During this time, the player must pick up Humans while trying to destroy as many Comets as possible. The period ends when either the players ship is destroyed by a Comet, the Comet is allowed to leave the screen or ten Comets have been destroyed (see BONUS PERIOD).

Time to take up your paint brush and paint the town Red (or Green or Orange, or whatever color you happen to have on hand)! A pair of fish are out to stop you but you can roll over them at the overpass. There's other items that just try to mess up your paint job; you can run over these folks easily (if you catch them).

Magic Sword - Heroic Fantasy (c) 1990 Capcom.


The land has been cast in darkness by Drokmar, who has been corrupted by the Black Orb; an artifact that promises immortality to anyone who comes under the influence of the orb's powerful sorcery. Two warriors set out to fight their way through fifty levels of platform beat-em-up, in order to destroy the orb - which lies at the top of the Dragon Tower - and free their lands.


Treasure chests litter the levels which, when smashed open, release treasure items, magic power-ups, keys, food and weapons. As players fight their way through the levels, they will come across a number of trapped prisoners. As long as the heroes are carrying keys, prisoners can be released who will then fight alongside the players, with each prisoner possessing their own unique attacks. Weapons and power-ups can be picked up to aid players in their quest and food can be found and eaten to increase player health.


As the players ascend the tower, they will be granted new magical weapons after each boss they defeat. The player's weapons are affected by a 'magic bar' that charges over time. When fully charged, the weapon has a powerful ranged attack, but when not charged only a close attack is produced. A magical staff will grant increased range attack ability. A magical blast may be generated by pressing the Attack and Jump buttons at once, but costs health.


There are multiple paths in the game, and two separate endings. Hidden doors can be used to skip levels when found - usually by attacking a wall or a particular spot.

Revision 2 :

* World and US releases (900725).

* Magic attacks hexagram graphic remplaced by a lightning bolt.


The US version has the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Magic Sword items :

1) King crown : magical protection.

2) Gauntlet : increase power.

3) Golden pot : healing magic for partner.

4) Crystal ball : detect treasure boxes.

5) Pedant : double score.

6) Magic potion : increases magic skill.

7) Bell : summons a hostile Lizardman to tame. If you have the Diamond Ring equipped he will kneel to accept you as a partner.

8) Diamond Ring : see Bell.

9) Scroll : brings good luck.


* Partners :

1) Big Man : is strong and has great endurance. His boomerang axe is powerful but slow.

2) Ninja : throws 2 to 5 stars which rebound from walls and ceiling. Fast but not so powerful.

3) Amazon : fires her crossbow continuously. Her attack is swift but lacking in power.

4) Thief : is able to locate hidden treasure chests and traps. His bomb packs quite a wallop, too.

6) Knight : is incredibly adept with his spear and is your strongest ally. He is held in the upper level of the tower.

7) Priest : lacks physical strength and speed but his holy bullets can do grave damage to undead monsters.

8) Wizard : shoots magical missiles. He has the most powerful attack but is slow and not much to speak physically.

9) Lizardman : becomes an ally only when brided with a diamond ring. He is a brute with great strength, speed and attacking power.


* Secret Doors :

Floor 7 - When you enter the floor, walk left and hit the column. warp to level 11.

Floor 17 - Slash the left side of the last arch. Warps to floor 20.

Floor 21 - Between the imprisoned (knight) and the exit, jump left from the elevated ground while slashing. Warp to floor 24.

Floor 28 - Crouch on the platform above the first pool of acid and slash the space in the middle. Enters RED floors 29 to 32.

Floor 34 - Jump and slash the left side of the the fourth pair of hanging pillars. Warps to floor 36.

Floor 39 - Slash the ledge immediately to the left of the first door after the pit of fire. Warps to floor 42.

Floor 40 - Crouch and slash the space above the ledge before the first pit of spikes. Enters RED floors 41 to 46.


* An extra 1,000,000 points! is available on blue level 30 : there is a wizard there who levitates rocks. Jump and sword him once, and then when he causes the rocks, to appear use magic (both buttons) to turn the rocks into 8K gold pieces. You can do this until time runs out.


* On level 14, go to the second 'door' with a head on top of it, jump and hit the 'nose' several times and two gems will drop down worth 80,000 a piece.

- UPDATES -


The Japanese version of this game features LOTS of stuff unavailable in any other version :


* In Challenge Mode there is a story intro at the beginning explaining the reason behind the Magical Drop competition, an extra animation showing a close-up of the Magical Drop book as it opens,  an ending for each character available in the game, a "Hard" difficulty setting, as well as a bonus fortune reading when you beat the Challenge Mode or you lose against the CPU and  refuse to continue. All of this is absent in the USA & Europe versions.


* In Challenge Mode, each character has a unique set of quotes before a battle begins, this even applies in the battles against the end bosses Tower & Fortune. In the USA & Europe versions there are only two possible quotes before a fight for all characters :


Quote #1

CPU : Get out of my way!

Player : I'll never lose to you! 


Quote #2

CPU : You want to fight?

Player : Now let's see who is better!


* In Adventure mode, each character has its very own story intro as well as its very own ending which is different from the one seen in Challenge mode. Aditionally this mode plays like a board game in which you compete against three other characters on the board, and if any of the others get to Empress' castle before your character, you will get a generic bad ending. If you arrive on a tile already occupied by a CPU-controlled character, you will have 2 options :

1) The option on the right : you don't want to trouble and ignore the opponent (sometimes you will have to back off 1 tile)

2) The option on the left : you fight the opponent. If you win, he or she will be eliminated but it would be the same for you if you fail, so be careful!

In the USA and European versions, there is no storyline and the only character on the board is controlled by the player. 


* Like in the previous game, each character has his/her own unique voice. The European version features less voice tracks and the USA version features a single voice track for all characters.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Play as Father Strength : At the character select screen, highlight Strength, hold C and press A or B. This trick does not work nor in puzzle mode nor in adventure mode.


* Play with bonus characters : At the character select screen, highlight any character (Except World, World's number is 21 so she can't be used for this trick) and wait until the timer counts down to the number assigned to that character :

00 - Fool

01 - Magician

02 - High Priestess

03 - Empress

04 - Emperor

05 - Hierophant

06 - Lovers

07 - Chariot

08 - Strength

11 - Justice

13 - Death

15 - Devil

17 - Star

19 - Sun

20 - Judgment

Then push C only three times. Moon, Hanged Man, Hermit, Temperance, Tower and Fortune will appear and will now be selectable. This trick does neither work in puzzle mode nor in adventure mode.


* Secret Stages :

1) Moon (after level 6) : Finish the sixth stage without exceeding 90 seconds since the beginning.

2) Hanged Man (after level 6) : Finish the sixth stage exceeding 300 seconds since the beginning.

3) Black Pierrot (after level 10) : Finish the tenth stage with at least 150,000 points.

- TRIVIA -


The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Mahjong Academy - Graduation Episode'.


This game was developed by no other than... Capcom! They could not publish it with their real name because of the 'dirty' nature of the game. Not that sexy mahjongs are considered THAT dirty in Japanese culture, but Mahjong Gakuen was different. Graphics were astounding, thanks to the artistic talents of young Akira Yasuda (aka Akiman, who soon became one of the most beloved Capcom artists). But the real plus brought by Mahjong Gakuen to its genre is the 'interaction' button (the 'H' one), which allowed the player to do kinky 'things' to the naked gals once they were beaten. By tapping faster the button, the animation sequence makes itself more and more explicit. Way too explicit for common Japanese arcades, which immediately banned the game or hid it in their darkest corners... but it was too late: Mahjong Gakuen sold in Japan like a regular Capcom coin-op, not like a product in the 'hentai mahjong' niche. This huge success was the natural result of the great effort developers put in their work (Akiman was so hooked to the project that he also lent his voice to the main character!). All this effort could not be wasted for a Japanese release only, and that's why Capcom recycled the graphics of Mahjong Gakuen for another coin-op, meant entirely for Western arcades: "Poker Ladies". They left behind the mahjong theme, opting for a more international video-poker one, and they published it via Mitchell, their famous subsidiary brand.


The 'interaction' feature would be used to better and more explicit effect in "Lady Killer", as well as in the bonus rounds in "Gals Panic S" and "Gals Panic S2".

Majestic Twelve - The Space Invaders Part IV (c) 1990 Taito.


The 3rd sequel to Taito's seminal "Space Invaders", Majestic Twelve leaves the classic Invaders game-play intact, but adds a slew of new alien invaders and power-ups to the mix. This, together with the vastly improved graphics that introduce colorful new backdrops - some of which scroll vertically in a similar fashion to the star-field in Namco's "Galaxian" - ensure that Majestic 12 is a worthy sequel to the legendary original.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Warp Codes : It's possible to warp to higher levels in Major Havoc from the start of the game by using certain codes. This is useful to not only be able to get through the game more quickly, but each warp also gives a fairly hefty bonus for carrying it out. This is done by playing the mini-Breakout game at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen when the game starts. The game will have a phrase such as, 'Enter Red Warp 00' at the bottom of the screen. What you do is use the controls to 'dial in' the first digit of the appropriate code given below, then press fire to serve the ball and repeat as necessary. The codes are :

Red code - 23, 250,000 pts, Level 4.

Yellow code - 46, 550,000 pts, Level 9.

Green code - 824, 650,000 pts, Level 10.

Aqua code - 315, 850,000 pts, Level : 13.

Purple code - 683, ?, Level ?.

Rainbow code - 948, ?, Level ?.


Note that you can only enter the codes in the order they're given - it's not possible to enter, say, the red warp code followed directly by the Rainbow warp code.

Released in November 1983.


New Features : 

* High-Tech Game Cabinet : A new video arcade game cabinet design delivers high visibility and increased player attraction.

* Roller Control : The backlit roller control provides left-to-right and right-to-left directional movement.

* Multi-Layer Printed-Circuit Board : This state-of-the art design printed-circuit board (PCB) provides low system noise with high system reliability.

* Game Within a Game : Action occurs in the lower right corner of the TACTICAL SCAN. Breakout can be played for a few seconds before the actual Major Havoc game play starts. Earn a bonus life here!

* Dual FIRE/JUMP Button : This dual-action button allows Major Havoc to jump in the maze sequence and to fire at enemy robots in the space wave.

* Add-A-Coin : This feature permits you to start a new Major Havoc game at the level where you last saw the TACTICAL SCAN in your previous game play.

* Secret Warp Code : The code feature rewards you for short game times as it advances to deep levels in game play. Use the roller control to dial in secret code numbers during the TACTICAL-SCAN wave.


Gameplay innovation at its finest. A game that would have done greater numbers had anyone cared in 1984. Only 500-600 dedicated machines were manufactured. Original price was $2,095. If Owen had done Major Havoc in a raster version, which was suggested, it would have sold 10 times as many. But unfortunately... the operators were getting very angry at vector games for failing all the time.


Mark Cerny came in the middle of the design, adding one of the space waves (the flying fish) and the last 4 base ship mazes. He also added some objects to the mazes (such as the gun and floating boots) and helped clean up old items that never got shipped.


The original name for the game was "Tollian Web", from the Star Trek episode The Tholian Web - an episode that also provided the inspiration for the unreleased "Ms. Gorf". Later titles included "Alpha One" and "Major Rex Havoc" (which was dropped when Atari discovered an underground comic with a similar name).


Ettore Ciaffi holds the official record for this game with 1,940,078 points.


A hack of this game is called "Major Havoc Return to Vax".


A Major Havoc unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames'.

Makaimura (c) 1985 Capcom.


The player takes on the role of Sir Arthur the knight, who sees his sweetheart, Princess Guinevere, kidnapped by the Goblin King.


Arthur must run and jump through 6 horizontal and 8-way scrolling levels in his bid to rescue the kidnapped princess. Arthur is initially armed with throwable lances, but a variety of other throwing weapons, such as axes, flaming torches, swords etc. are dropped by defeated enemies and can be picked up and used to fend off the zombies, bats, demons and other assorted satanic minions that Sir Arthur has to face.


Each of the 6 end-of-level gates is guarded by one of Satan's generals; huge, end-of-level guardians who must be defeated before the player can finally reach the Goblin King and rescue the princess.

- UPDATES -


This version, unlike all other versions, uses a cross instead of a shield.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Turn Into A frog : As soon as you become a duck, shoot a tombstone 15 times in a row and an angel character will appear. This angel will fire a bolt at you. Let it hit you and you'll become a frog.


* Frog Bug Trick : Wait until the timer reaches 0 :01 and then have the magician turn you into a frog, if he turns you into a frog as the timer runs out, Arthur becomes distorted (sprite broken) and the timer becomes crazy. But you can continue the play like this. :)


* Levitating Monsters : At level 6 (just after having beaten the big red guardian), kill the 5 skulls, then climb up the ladder to wake up the 2 doglike monsters. Go down again and walk right until you're blocked by the wall. Then wait for the monsters to stand just over you (possibly at the rightmost possible point), shoot at this very moment and it happens that they jump and remain in mid-air. It's not easy to do that, but you can manage to have both jumping and stuck. After that, you can safely climb up the ladder and walk while the monsters are moving above you without touching you. Don't shoot again, or they may jump up and go to the upper platform.


* Boss Tricks :

1) Dragon Trick - You can pass the level four dragon by fleeing! Just walk until music changes to boss theme (if you can't hear that, the spot is where you have the last two flames on the left of the screen), then go to extreme left : if everything is okay, the music should stop and the flames freeze. Go to the door to collect the key.

2) Demon Trick - To make disappear the demon boss at end of level five, try running away from him as fast as you can! Reach the floor with the hole in it and jump through it. If you have correct timing, you will fall in the pit, avoiding the moving platforms, and eventually escape the boss. Ogre boss tricks - The ogre bosses tend to jump when you fire, even if not directly at them. This is very useful in level six,when you can avoid losing your armor by activating the ogres, then going down the ladder and firing while holding your man in the same position where he starts at the beginning of the level.


* Other Tricks :

1) Weapon Trick - After having defeated a level boss(es),the knight can fire two or three "invisible shots"; if the man is facing the right border of the screen while doing so,the shots will reappear in the following stage. This can be exploited to kill some of the skulls at beginning of level six (soooo useful...).

2) Fire Bridge Trick - If the game difficulty level is not set to hard (you can check this by the zombies' speed), the fire bridge can be traversed by simply going right without stopping.

3) Weird Spots - In levels five and six there are spots where you can jump through the yellow rock background : usually getting blocked or killed. In level six, the floor below the bosses' has an invisible hole in it at the extreme left : this can be used to the player's advantage.

4) Cemetery Glitch - Reach the last tomb before the devil, jump it and go right two or three steps. The knight should now be in front of a tree on the background. Don't go any further - go back, instead. Climb the first ladder you'll meet, then climb down the one on the left, which shouldn't be completely on the screen if you peformed the trick correctly : surprise!

5) Warp Trick - This is very odd : by a strategy similar to the one to reveal the cemetery glitch (that is, fiddling with scroll), you can activate a 'level warp' in the platform section at the beginning of level four. It involves going right, then trying to have some platform carry you beyond the 'scroll stops' line on the left. This should kill the knight and possibly make the next life start on the fire bridge or in level 5.


* Armor :

1) The first armor is in the cemetery, between the red devil's starting position and last money bag : jump there to catch it. In the forest,there's the infamous unreachable armor : to collect it you should reach a spot just above the money bag right after the first plant. This cannot be done by jumping.

2) There are two armors in the ice palace. One can be gotten by walking left off the topmost platform; the other will fall right in front of the inferior plant by roaming around the other plant's location.

3) There are two armors in the blue cave. The first one is obtained by climbing the leftmost ladder and falling off the ledge. To get the second, perform a well-placed jump (you have to cross some precise point in mid-air while falling) before the fight with the last red devil.

4) The last armor is collected in level six by simply walking right on the first floor with hulk-like monsters on it (The programmers thought you couldn't avoid getting hit by the ogres and so they didn't hide that armor).

Marble Madness (c) 1984 Atari Games.


Marble Madness is an abstract maze game for one or two players. The game's goal is to guide a small glass marble over a three-dimensional maze and reach the finish line before the level's timer has expired. Any seconds that remain on the timer when the finish line is crossed are carried over to the next level. 


As well as having to negotiate the marble over treacherous walkways and ramps, numerous obstacles and unfriendly creatures will try to slow the marble's progress or knock it over the edge of a platform, wasting yet more precious seconds until a replacement marble appears. The two-player game has players competing to reach the goal first. 


Marble Madness features six different mazes.

- TRIVIA -


Released in December 1984.


Mark Cerny was only 17 years old when he joined Atari and designed Marble Madness. The game was designed as part of a contest Atari ran at the time, allowing outsiders to design a game. Mark was very well known for his game-playing skills and easily won the contest. He then taught himself how to program in assembly language before joining Atari, so he found it very easy to settle in at Atari.


Released in December 1984, Marble Madness was the first game to run on the new Atari System 1 hardware and was the perfect showcase for Atari to demonstrate the technical superiority of its new arcade architecture, it was also the first game to feature such impressive and cleanly rendered pseudo 3-D Graphics. The original design brief called for the trackball to be motorized and synchronize its spin with that of the marble, to simulate inertia.


Marble Madness was the first game to feature true stereo sound; it was the first game to truly capitalise on what in-game music could offer the player, with each level having its own distinctive, and suspense building soundtrack. Marble Madness was also one of the few games of the time to have a definite goal, in that the game ends when all levels are completed.


The race names are :

1. Practice

2. Beginner

3. Intermediate

4. Aerial

5. Silly

6. Ultimate

Stan Szczepanski holds the official record for this game with 187,880 points.


A sequel to this classic game, entitled "Marble Madness 2 - Marble Man" was fully developed and a very small number of cabinets were built, but unfortunately the game was never released. Unlike the first game's superb trackball control, 'Marble Man' was controlled via a joystick.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hints :

1) Anticipate your next move and start the Trak-Ball rolling in that direction ahead of time.

2) Complete each raceway as fast as possible because extra seconds mean extra points, and the extra time from one raceway is carried over to the next raceway

3) Try to maneuver around the Black Steelie, or try to bump him off a cliff to get rid of him permanently.

4) Move quickly to avoid being swallowed by the green Marble Munchers.

5) Watch for patterns, and time your movements right to pass by difficult obstacles.

6) Some raceways have alternate paths, so explore a bit and you may find an easier way to reach the goal. Bonus points are given for paths which are more difficult.


* Cancel The Timer : Begin a game and then hold down either the 1 or 2 player Start and press the 'service switch' twice. The first press will glitch the screen display slightly - the second will remove it and give you 99 seconds to complete the level. This method adds 60 seconds to the clock, after which the normal countdown will begin. The clock will not appear to be counting down during the first 60 seconds, probably because the 99-second display was overflowed by the extra 60 seconds added. This method can be used multiple times per level for virtually infinite play time.


* When you play 2 players, the winner of each level gets a bonus 5 seconds (I was better than my brother, so I'd always get the 5 seconds :D). If your opponent can make it as far as the silly race, that's an extra 25 seconds for the ultimate race, not to mention a possible extra 10 seconds with a wand. The opponent can also continue once (with the same time as the other player).


* This isn't really a trick, but some people don't realize it : On the practice race, don't move when you start, and after a few seconds, a ramp will appear that will slide away the ball.

Mario Bros. (c) 1983 Nintendo.


Mario Brothers is a superb, single-screen platform game in which the legendary "Mario Brothers", Mario and Luigi, must try to rid each level of a number of pests that have infested the waterworks : Shellcreepers (turtles), Sidesteppers (crabs that need to be hit twice) and Fighterflies (flies, that can only be attacked when they touch a platform).


Players can jump upwards to hit the platform above them, which will 'flip' any enemies on the above platform onto their backs. The prone enemies can then be kicked into the water to remove them. A 'POW' button also appears on a number of screen; this can be 'butted' by a player, causing all on-screen enemies to flip onto their backs; as well as destroying any enemy fireballs that may be around. Each POW can only be used a maximum of three times. 


As well as the game's enemies, players are also hampered by the huge amount of inertia that comes into play when controlling Mario or Luigi. This is due to the low degree of traction that exists between the Mario brothers and the platforms. On later levels, ice appears on the platforms reducing the amount of traction even further. As the game progresses, water drops hang below the platforms and freeze into deadly icicles, which will eventually break off and fall.

- TRIVIA -


Released in March 1983. The US version was released in May 1983. 


Shigeru Miyamoto was inspired to make "Mario Bros." a two-player game after seeing Williams' 1982 platform game, "Joust". This would in turn lead to the creation of Mario's brother, Luigi. 


Mario Brothers was the first platform game designed entirely around its eponymous hero, Mario, and his brother, Luigi. Although the plumber had, of course, featured in the first and third games in the legendary "Donkey Kong" series. The game's simple-yet-involving gameplay only hinted at the greatness that was to follow for both Mario and Nintendo itself. 


The Mario character would soon become Nintendo's mascot; and while the plumber's arcade outing would be few and far between, Mario would prove to be at the cornerstone of the massive critical and commercial success Nintendo would subsequently enjoy. The "Mario Bros." arcade game also saw the introduction of Mario's brother, Luigi; named after a pizzeria that was situated near the then-new Washington headquarters of Nintendo of America, called "Mario and Luigi's". 


Despite being released at the time of the infamous videogame industry collapse of 1983; when smaller arcade companies, such as Centuri, (producers of "Pleiades", "Phoenix" and "Time Pilot") simply went out of business; and even industry giants such as Atari, Konami and Taito saw a drastic reduction in arcade revenue; "Mario Bros." was a huge success and would provide a firm foundation for Nintendo to make a move into the home console market for which they are now known.


The musical introduction at the beginning of the game is the first movement of Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.


The stage layout for Mario Bros. is used as an unlockable stage in Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Nintendo Wii.

- UPDATES -


The Japanese version features an extra life every 30000 points, compared with only one free life per game in the English version.


The Japanese version features three all-Shellcreeper rounds before the first bonus round, instead of two. In the US version, you have to kick off 3 Shellcreepers in the first round, and 6 in the second. In the Japanese version, you have to take care of 3 Shellcreepers in the first round, 4 in the second, and 6 in the third.


- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is relatively simple. It is based on how many critters you knock off the ledges :

Shellcreeper : 800 points

Sidestepper : 800 points

Fighterfly : 800 points


Knocking over an enemy : 10 points


The above scores are for knocking only one critter off the ledge. If you knock off two in a row, you get 1,600 points. Three nets you 2400 points while knocking four or more off in a row garners you 3200 points.


You also get points for things other than the above :

Slipice : 500 points

Coin : 800 points

Red Fireball : 1000 points

Blue Fireball : 200 points


In addition to getting points for the above, you also can get points during the bonus rounds :

1) You get 800 points x the number of coins you gather.

2) If you get all ten coins, you get 5000 points in the first bonus round and 8000 points for each bonus round thereafter.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, Mario and/or Luigi will be in the middle almost under the POW button. Your job is to go after the critters entering from the upper left or right pipe. Learn how to jump not only up, but also sideways. The platforms don't have a lot of room for jumping straight up. You need to learn how to jump sideways so you can quickly make it to the next platform. This is both for running and standing still.


* Know how each of the critters moves and what their behavior is. You can use this knowledge to your advantage. For example, an easy way to take care of Sidesteppers is as follows (assume that critter is moving left. Do the opposite of what is stated below if the critter is moving right) :

1) When they are just to the right of Mario or Luigi, jump up and hit the platform. This will make the Sidestepper mad and it will move left again.

2) Right when it passes over, hit it again. This will launch it up and make it drop to the next platform for easy pickings.


* As often as possible, try to kill animals in groups. Any animal killed is worth 800 points (plus the 800 point bonus coin). If you kill two animals in a short time (approx 1 second), the first is still only worth 800, but the second animal is worth 1600 points, not just 800. For three animals, the points are 800-1600-2400. For four animals, the points are 800-1600-2400-3200. The point for a killed animal is never more than 3200. So if you were to kill 5 at once, the fourth and fifth animal would both be worth 3200.


* Also remember, that unlike the fireballs, the critters can wrap around the screen. So if one disappears off the left edge, be prepared for it to reappear on the right edge.


* Use the POW button conservatively. You only get three uses in the game, so plan those uses wisely. The best time to use the POW is when a lot of critters are on the screen at one time. In addition, make sure they are close to the bottom when you flip them over or you may not have time to knock them off the upper platforms.


* After you flip a critter over, you have about 5 seconds to knock it off the platform. If you fail to do this, it will change color and speed up.


* If the last critter in a round is a Shellcreeper or a Sidestepper, it will automatically go to its fastest pace; if it is a Fighterfly, it will continue at its current pace.


* Learn how the critters move. If they bump into each other or a coin, they will reverse direction. You can work this to your advantage by trapping some critters between two flipped over critters. Again, be quick or they will recover and be faster.


* Coins can be collected by either grabbing them or by hitting them from under the platform they are traveling on.


* Things such as the Fighterfly, Red Fireball, and Green Fireball must be hit when they are in contact with the platform. This can make these things a challenge especially when there are other things harassing you.


* Speaking of the fireballs, some players hunt them for extra points. There are some things to keep in mind :

1)The more times you knock off the Red Fireball, the faster it gets.

2) You can escape off either edge to escape the fireballs. They cannot wrap around the screen.

3) As you get into the higher rounds, the Green Fireballs appear much quicker so you must be ready to get out of their way.

4) Only one Green Fireball will be active at a time, however, when one ends the other can immediately begin.


* If you get killed, you will be placed on a platform above the first gap. You have 10 seconds of invincibility before the platform disappears and puts you in the thick of things. Plan your re-entry carefully.


* The Bonus Rounds appear at round 3, round 8, and every 7 rounds thereafter (for the Japanese version, add 1 to the round number), and are pretty easy once you get a pattern down. In the first Bonus Round, you will have 20 seconds to get the ten bonus coins. However, in later Bonus Rounds, you will only have 15 seconds.


* The later rounds become challenging because not only do you have critters to deal with, after the second Bonus Round, Slipice will appear in search of a location to plant itself and freeze a platform. Until it manages to completely freeze the platform, the brothers may interrupt it and punch it from underneath. The platform will only remain frozen if Slipice has been given enough time to do its work. After the third Bonus stage, Icicles begin to form on the underside of the highest platform, and the pipes that sit above it. They will fall down from the upper platform and pipes to add to the hazards you already have to deal with. Using the POW will knock them down before they do any damage.


* When you are playing as two players, both of your characters are on the screen at the same time. It is up to the players as to whether they wish to cooperate or turn it into a death match.

- TRIVIA -


Licensed to Taito.


This game is known in Japan as "Exciting Hour - The Prowrestling Network".

The 2 players version of this game is known as "Mania Challenge".


In the game, if you look closely at the audience in the background, you will see a variety of recognizable characters including a boy in a Union Jack t-shirt, Darth Vader, Superman, the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man (look to the far left when outside the ring) and ZZ Top is very prominently present in the middle of the crowd..


The champion in this game is very obviously a copy of Hulk Hogan. First of all, he bears a striking resemblence to Hogan. Second, his name is 'Golden Hulk'; Hulk Hogan debuted wrestling as 'Sterling Golden'. Finally, Golden Hulk's most powerful move is the leg drop, which is Hogan's finisher.


Other wrestlers are copied from superstars of the early 80s : The Insane Warrior is a copy of Road Warrior Animal, Coco Savage is probably Kamala The Cannibal and The Piranha is probably Mil Mascaras. The main wrestler (you) bears a striking resemblence to Kerry Von Erich. These are guesses, but all the mentioned wrestlers were very popular about the time this game was released.


Rac Carpana holds the official record for this game with 5,000,150 points.


- UPDATES -


In the game, The Piranha's name is misspelled as 'The Pirania'.

In clone "Exciting Hour" :

- Insane Warrior's name is misspelled as 'Insane Worrier'.

- Golden Hulk is known as 'Blues Bloody'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Here is a complete Mat Mania moves list :

First, basic moves :

Joystick - Move Around

Button 1 - Punch (P)

Button 2 - Kick (K)

Both Buttons - Run


While Opponent is Standing :

P+K - Dash at opponent.

P (while running) - Shoulder Block

K (while running) - Flying Press


To grab the opponent, run towards him.


While holding on to opponent :

P - Irish Whip (Throw opponent)

K - Pile Driver

P+UP - Body Slam

K+UP - Suplex


After Opponent has been thrown :

P+Opponent's direction - Elbow Smash

P - Back Body Drop

K+Opponent's direction - Clothesline

K - Reverse Mule Kick


While Opponent is on the ground :

P - Pick up opponent

K - Pin Opponent


While on the Turnbuckle :

P - Knee Drop

K - Sunset Flip


You can do 3 moves (2 in later matches [late 30s on]) to your opponent before needing to ram him with the old 'faceblock' maneuver. However, the moves appear to be broken into categories :


Big moves - Piledriver and Brainbuster (Suplex)

Medium moves - Clothesline, Elbow, Backdrop

Small moves - Body Slam, Spinning Kick


Doesn't seem to count - Shoulder Block, Flying Body Press, Rope Moves


The 'count' works as follows. Usually you get one of each class of move in order from big to small. You can always substitute a lower move for a higher one. At certain times you will get only medium and small, especially the first series when facing Karate Fighter or Piranha after match 5. Sometimes you won't be able to do three. You can tell because your opponent puts up a small, ineffective resistance to your second move.


Once per match, you CAN do two big moves in a row. You are guaranteed to be able to do a third move afterward. In the first 5 matches, the triple is generally between 2:30 and 2:15.


* Miscellaneous notes :

1) You can only climb on the turnbuckles in the top-left and top-right corners.

2) Running towards the ropes and pressing the K button will cause you to jump out of the ring (should only be done while an opponent is out there).

3) The maximum number of jumps off the rope you can do is three - any more and the opponent will get up regardless of the amount of damage inflicted.

4) Fight as little as possible outside the ring; you run the chance of being thrown to the other end and facing a ring out loss (especially with Coco Savage and the Piranha - they are dirty fighters!).

5) When an opponent throws you, you have the choice of pressing P to do a shoulder block or K to do a flying press. The move you select should depend on the opponent's reaction - if they throw you and run, press K repeatedly to beat them with the flying press. If the opponent is standing there, it is almost a sure sign that you will be receiving one of their 'stopping moves' (i.e.: Coco's Haymaker or Piranha's choke hold). For this, press K repeatedly. If the opponent has not prepared their signature stop, this usually means they are just going to punch or kick you. Pressing P will give them a shoulder block and knock them down. Try to decide on which move you plan on doing once you see their reaction.

6) If you start to get the 'upper hand' on your opponent (which isn't that hard to do), throw him into the ropes and when he bounces back, let him collide into you (you should be the first one to get up), pick him up and do a pile driver, pick him up, throw him into the ropes and let him collide into you, pick him up and pile drive him again. You can do this for as long as you like but make sure to pin him before the time runs out. For a sure pin, just climb the top rope and land on him three times then pin.

7) A change in the music in the game indicates you are in danger of losing the match!


* List of opponents :


1) Insane Warrior

Signature Move : Body Press

Difficulty : Very Easy

Comments : Comic relief for the game. A very easy opponent to beat up and a good learning partner.


2) Karate Fighter

Signature Move : Rabbit Punch

Difficulty : Easy

Comments : Another opponent to use as a practice partner.


3) Coco Savage

Signature Move : Slingshot (grabs you by the ankles and throws you across / out of the ring).

Difficulty : Very Difficult

Comments : A dirty fighter. Will knock you down by giving you a shoulder block or knocking you on the head. Will cheat by getting you near the ropes and giving you plenty of shoulder blocks!


4) The Pirana

Signature Move : Elbow Drop

Difficulty : Moderate

Comments : The dirtiest fighter in the game. A very difficult opponent to fight with outside the ring.


5) Golden Hulk

Signature Move : Leg Drop

Difficulty : Moderate

Comments : The champ. Likes to body slam and throw opponents out of the ring.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* A Trick : You can determine which direction the end of level boss will move before it even appears by looking at your score. If the hundreds digit is odd, the boss will move to the left. If it is even, it'll move right (the tens and units digits are always zero).


* One Million Points Bonus : On the violet continent, if you see a coelacanth fossil on the left side, go to the -right- side and shoot. Cleopatra appears - shoot her and you'll get a million-point bonus. The coelacanth may only appear on the third violet continent.


* 80,000 Points Bonus : At some points in the game you will see two columns of green arrows down the center of the screen. Concentrate on either the left or right column of these arrows, and try to shoot 16 in a row. You will be awarded an 80,000 bonus for doing this. The first time these appear, it is possible to get two such bonuses in a row (if there are not many enemies around!), and sometimes more if the level ends before the column has finished appearing. Later on there is a short column of only 16, so only one bonus is possible here.


* 50,000 Point Bonus : You've seen a big enemy that combines into parts. When you hear the tune it is about to appear, STOP SHOOTING (You don't actually have to stop shooting altogether, but if you hit part of the enemy before the center part flashes white the bonus will not work). Position your ship so that you are just underneath the center part of the enemy and wait for it to flash white. Once this has happened, shoot the center part several times : the enemy will be destroyed and you will be awarded the 50,000 point special bonus.

Mega Man - The Power Battle (c) 1995 Capcom.


Have you ever pictured a Mega Man game that allows to skip all the platform elements and just grapple against the bosses? That's pretty much the main idea in this game! Choose from Megaman, Protoman or Bass and battle against classic bosses in the series. You have to fight a total of 18 Robot Masters, taken from the first 7 Megaman games from the Nintendo Famicom. Features great 2-D graphics, solid control, and a nice use of strategy (since the right order of weapons will rid you of specific enemies in no time!).

Megattack (c) 1980 GamePlan.


SINGLE PLAYER GAME


The game-play sequence in MEGATTACK consists of 4 or 5 turns (operator selectable) each of which lasts as long as the player can skillfully maneuver his spacepod to avoid destruction. When he loses a spacepod, the GIP message reappears, accompanied by the GIP sound, and displays the number of spacepods left. After the last spacepod is destroyed, the game-over sound is heard and the game-over message is displayed.


Assuming a (4) pod game, play begins with player-scores (00000) and at the top and the (3) best scores displayed across the bottom Eight (8) monsters appear in the upper portion of the screen and move towards the bottom, while dropping their bombs. The player uses his joystick control to move his spacepod across the bottom of the screen. The spacepod will start with the number (4) in the center and the number will decrease each time a spacepod is destroyed so that the number (1) will be in the center on the last round.


As the spacepod is moved across the bottom of the screen the player fires his laser energy-beams towards the left, right, and straight-up accompanied by an echoing laser sound effect. The laser beams have unlimited range, covering the entire play-field, and each spacepod has an unlimited number of shots. The (3) laser beams are fired simultaneously. Each fire-button must be released and pressed again to fire a second shot. Also, there is a slight "reload" delay so that beams cannot-be fired too rapidly.


Whenever a laser beam strikes a monster or a bomb, it explodes with a visual flash and an audio blast. If a monster is blasted, the player is awarded a 'kill' and his score is increased by the appropriate score (per the scoring menu when a bomb is blasted, no points are scored.  


When a spacepod is hit by a bomb, it explodes with a growing flash and a reverberating blast. When the spacepod gets too close to a monster, the monster jumps up and sporadically devours it while growling and burping, if a monster reaches the bottom, it bounces across the bottom in an attempt to devour the spacepod.


When all the monsters in a given round have been destroyed the screen will turn into a starfield, and small space rings will appear, which if not shot at, hit, and destroyed will grow in size. If any one (1) ring is allowed to reach a predetermined size, it will de-activate the spacepods laser gun, which during these rounds only fires straight up, lift the spacepod off the bottom of the screen, absorb it and then disappear (shrinking in size), thus ending the round. The next round begins with the next wave of monsters. This starfield round occurs between every wave of monsters, and if the player is successful in destroying all the rings the next wave of monsters will then appear.


When the spacepod is finally destroyed either by being absorbed, hit by a bomb or devoured by a monster the round is over and the video image returns to the GIP display flashing player (1) up and displaying the remaining spacepods the screen then goes black again and this time the pod with the number (3) in the center appears at the bottom of the screen and play continues as before.


During play there are always (8) monsters (max) on the screen, however the monsters attack in waves of 25, after each multiple of 25 kills the starfield or space ring round will appear with each ring worth the same score as the monsters were worth in the previous screen display. The monsters that reappear after each space ring round are a new shape, and color and score more points, and drop a different color bomb, any monsters left at the end of a round will reappear at the beginning of the next round. At the beginning of the game the action is rather moderate to allow new players an opportunity to develop a 'feel' for the game. In each succeeding wave of monsters, the bombs begin to fall at an increased rate and the monsters motions are increased.


All of these features combine to make MEGATTACK satisfying for the novice, challenging for the expert, and profitable for the operator.


TWO-PLAYER MODE


The play of MEGATTACK in a two-player game is identical to single-play with the players alternating turns. On the Upright Version, the players use one common set of controls. On the cocktail version there are two sets of controls on opposite sides of the table. The computer activates control alternately between player 1 and 2 and flip-flops the screen image so that it is oriented to the player in control.


The GIP message, which appears after each turn, clearly indicates which player is up by flashing it in the player's color. This also allows time for the players to position themselves at the controls, but is brief enough to avoid unnecessary "dead-time". The use of two different player-colors eliminates any confusion as to which player is in control.

* At the end of stage 1, a large plane rises in front of the player. If you stand .25 to .5 inches up from the bottom of the cliff, and line up so your bullets will hit just to the right of the plane's center, it cannot hit you with its cannon. This takes practice.

Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001 (c) 1996 Nazca.


A horizontal-scrolling, parodistic World War II themed jump-and-shoot game. Extra weapons can be picked up and used for greater firepower, and vehicles (such as the 'Super Vehicle-001' - or Metal Slug - of the game's title) can be entered and driven. The levels are also littered with bearded hostages who, when rescued, award the player with point bonuses (in the form of medals) and weapon power-ups. Metal Slug is a superb game which achieved the status of instant classic and is still considered by many to be the pinnacle of 2-Dimensional game design.

- TRIVIA -


Released in April 1996.


Etymology of 'Metal Slug' : Meeher, the lead designer of the game for Nazca, wanted to create an armored fighting vehicle that could crawl on the ground like a 'slug', similar to a snail but without an outer shell protecting its body. The word 'metal' in the title indicates that the vehicle is mechanical. Initially players regarded the title as being 'not good enough'. Meeher later joked about the title, saying 'Maybe I don't make much [sic] of a sense?'.

Slugs in Metal Slug sequels included animals (usually only the Vulcan cannon mounted on the animal, with a cannon attachment occasionally available), planes and other vehicles that do not fit Meeher's original definition.


While being an obvious parody of World War II and the Nazi regime (the rebel army's flag is a deliberate pastiche of the Nazi "Swastika"), Metal Slug also lampoons 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'MASH'. General Morden, the rebel army's evil general, is a parody of Saddam Hussein.


Just as the 2 main heroes (Marco & Tarma) appear on every chapter in the Metal Slug series, General Morden & Allen O' Neill (the machine gun wielding, trash mouth-talking, buffed soldier) are the series' classic main villains.


Cliff Reese holds the official record for this game with 1,044,890 points.


The same team that created Metal Slug previously created a handful of games for Irem which have very similar graphics and gameplay. "Cyber Lip" (1990) had some of the core developers as the original Metal Slug. "Gunforce" (1991) and "In the Hunt" (1993) had noticeably similar gameplay, with graphics that have a slight resemblance to Metal Slug. "Gunforce 2" (1994) not only had similar gameplay but the sounds of dying soldiers were almost exactly the same as Metal Slug. Because of this, some fans refer to Gunforce 2 as "Metal Slug Zero".


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Metal Slug features a 'blood ON' option (soldiers squirt blood when shot, instead of water). This can be activated via the 'Setting The Soft Dip' option in the game's dip switch menu.


* When you drop down at the start of a mission, press B to make the parachute disappear, thus allowing your character to drop down more quickly.


* Don't waste ammo like an idiot. Metal Slug requires some thinking and shooting like a maniac is not the best way to play this game.


* Don't waste special weapons on shields. Shielded soldiers will toss aside their shields when they need to fire, so shoot at them only at this instant. Or use your knife if you manage to get close enough.


* Use your knife against lone enemies. No need to waste 10 rounds of your Heavy Machine Gun on a single bastard!


* When Metal Slug is dangerously low on health (but not that low so you are forced to leave it), use the frontal attack for major damage.


* Most enemy tanks and machines, except for with the front ends and pointy parts, are harmless. As Marco or Tarma, jump on them and he'll constantly bounce on top of them.


* Whenever you jump out of the slug, you are invincible for a brief amount of time. Obviously, this is a cool advantage and it can save your ass in a lot of occasions. Specially against the blue mortars since you can't avoid them. Note, however, that there is no invincibility time when you jump back into the slug.


* There is apparently no 'reload time' when you throw grenades or rockets. The rate depends on how many of either are currently on-screen such that if you are close to an enemy, the rate will be negligible. You may use this trick against some bosses and in any other situation to pass through unscratched.


* Those score-maniacs will be particularly pleased to learn that you get a shit-load of points by killing all those jumping/flying soldiers who are such a nuisance. So, if scoring is your cup of tea, linger around during these points and stock up.


* Killing the enemy soldiers can be fun, but the best things about this game are certainly the comedy scenes and the hidden secrets. The greatest contributors of points, rescued hostages points, are also the hardest to earn. The first problem is to find them, the second is to stay alive to get credit for your rescues (Once you complete a mission, you receive 10,000 pts for every POW you rescued).


MISSION 1 (hostages : 10) :

Two lots of 2 hostages hidden in the two waterfalls just before you get to the boss. Just blast the tops of the waterfalls and they will fall.


MISSION 2 (hostages : 12) :

Blast down at the green bush underneath the bridge just before you reach the mid level boss (large tank on rails above you) and three secret prisoners will come running in your direction.


MISSION 3 (hostages : 15) :

There are secret hostages hidden within the two large trees that you can blast down in the section where you have the Metal Slug tank. These seem to be random, just try blasting those trees down and sometimes they appear.


There are hidden hostages that drop down from the sky when you are fighting the end of level boss; just don't kill the boss until they have all appeared.


MISSION 4 (hostages : 20) :

Just after you have got the Metal Slug tank at the beginning of the level : blast the ceiling of the bar just above the light/lampshade high up on the wall at the entrance of the bar.


At the end of level bosses you can either blast in the top right hand corner of the cave to get 3 hidden hostages OR blast the far bottom left hand corner for 3 hidden hostages. It is not possible to get both of these groups. You can only get one or the other.


MISSION 5 (hostages : 13):

Blast the first and second houses and two hostages will appear.


Fire at the top of the first and second trees in the stage inbetween the shops and houses. The first tree yields 3 POW's and the second only two.


Blast the undercarriage of the end of level boss after it has lifted up on stilts to get three extra prisoners who also provide useful power ups! 


MISSION 6 (hostages : 25) :

At the beginning, shoot above you to find one prisoner.


Destroy the big pack of rocks to deliver one POW.


Blast the small white cloud above you just after the boat you are on has run ashore to get two hidden hostages.


When you're out of the boat, go left in the water to find some points.


POWs appear on screen during the fight with the final boss, if you shoot in the top right corner.


* Beat the game in two players mode to view a different ending sequence.

Metal Slug 2 - Super Vehicle-001/II (c) 1998 SNK.


The heroes of Metal Slug, Marco and Tarma, are called into action once again to take on the might of General Morden and his armies in this, the first of several sequels to the superb 1996 original. This time, however, Morden has acquired a number of powerful allies to aid him in his evil schemes, some of which are not even human. The 2 brave soldiers are called upon to deal with this threat once again, aided by members of the newly founded 'Sparrow Squad', Fio and Eri.


Metal Slug 2 improved on much of what made the first game great; featuring more enemies, larger bosses, more weapons, more vehicles, more hostages, more surprises and more humour than its illustrious predecessor. The occasional moments of slowdown that blighted the first game are still present, however.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Rescued hostages are the greatest contributors of points. But you have to stay alive to get credit for your rescues (Once you complete a mission, you receive 10'000 pts for every POW).


MISSION 1, Deserts of Arabia : You are sent to control a loyalist force suspected of building weapons of mass destruction.

* The tallest tree after the 1st building contains lots of fruit and 3 hidden POW's.

* Palace : Shoot towards the right of the red banner to release 2nd lieutenant Hyakutaro Ichimonji. This mystic POW has an energy bolt which is powerful and homes in on anything you can shoot (this means structures as well; collateral damage). He'll help you until you finish the mission or die.

* You'll find the Camel Slug after the conversing Arabs. It comes equipped with a Vulcan but provides no cover against enemy fire. Like the Metal Slug, the Camel can run over enemy soldiers.

* BOSS 1, Harrier VTOL : Waves of swordsmen rush at you. Take them out before they get too close. After about 100 shots, 2 bazooka grunts open fire. Stay in between the jet exhausts. Aim for the engines as much as possible (You'll see and get 10,000 pt. for the 1st wing and 50,000 for the 2nd).


MISSION 2, Valley of the Pharaohs : Intelligence has indicated that the enemy army is using a secret Egyptian site to house military machinery.

* Use your gun to knock out an eye from the Sphinx (30,000 pts).

* Without hitting the explosive barrel, kill the Imperial Guards. Then, fire at the top right corner offscreen, for 3 POW's.

* If you stand next to the 1st and 3rd miners, they'll dig up some bonus items.

* Shoot at the top right of the support tower for a POW.

* Pyramid slope : A gem or 3 POW's are hidden at the top of the screen, right above the spot where the 1st mummy pops up.

* If you get a whiff of undead breath, you'll become a member of the undead, identifiable only by headgear. You'll be carrying only a pistol. Jumping is also quite a task. The flashing healing potions will turn you back into a human instantly.

* Near the door, get the POW's before clearing out the mummies.

* You'll catch up with Rumi Aikawa here. Shoot her for a healing potion or points.

* The eye hieroglyph before the special mummy hides a gem.

* Shoot the deceased explorer to make her give up a gem. Disgruntled, she'll give you the matching stick of dynamite.

* Jogging to the left, you'll see a few platforms to jump on. From the 2nd to the top, you can carefully jump over to the right. The long one holds 2 treasure chests. But don't stop here. Carefully jump on top of the cat statues. Shoot the chest open, which holds a magic lamp. If you are patient enough, a djinni will appear. Wait just a moment longer, and he'll grant a wish for riches. Starting from the moment the lamp is released, count the plumes of smoke and jump after the 5th one. Shoot above the right statue for another magic lamp.

* On the next level path (8th platform), the head of the hieroglyph holds gems. Shoot'em out!!

* If you let the mummy attack the explorer, you can destroy the new mummy for a gem.

* The twin-armed Slugnoid vehicle is located on one of the higher ledges of the tower of doom. The main cannon (C) fires downwards ((A)+(B) Swan Dive)

* BOSS 2, Iron Claw : Use your cannon and bombs. If you stay at the same altitude for a while, Iron Claw rears back and charges towards you. It won't fire while doing so, giving you time to get free hits in. When Iron Claw primes up, jump to the side ledges.


* BOSS 2 Freeze bug - Stop the nasty climbing! This original flaw give players an unfair advantage to eliminate Boss2 without any difficulty. Below is the following of how to activate. When the player standing on the platform which placed on the last chest, jump to the right edge of the next platform and fall to right lower platform immediately. The screen scrolls up and the boss emerges from the bottom of the screen. Instead of being killed as usual, the player is still there safe and sound ,while the boss freezes and do no climbing at all. At this moment, Just stay on the platform where you are and attack then it will be destroyed afterwards. The trick is also possible when riding the slugnoid or two players' game, but both player must do it at the same time.


MISSION 3, Supply Train : You've managed to catch up with an enemy train headed for a night shipment to the Far East.

* At the engine of the train, rescue the POW. Shoot at the smokestack from below to release 3 POW's.

* From the head of the engine, manage to clear more space with your jump to the next train for 50,000 pt.

* Use the Slug flyer which is equipped with a Vulcan that is limited in angular range.

* BOSS 3, Four Legger : While the boss is standing, jump to shoot at it. Everything except the flame-thrower can be avoided by hiding underneath its legs. If you still have the Slug flyer, stay on the left.


MISSION 4, Chinese City, Downtown : A platoon of enemy troops is stationed nearby. 

* Collect as much of the food as you can. Once you're fat, your weapons will cause more damage but you'll be slower.

* Most of the buildings can be demolished, revealing hidden POW's or bonuses. Some of the POW's can be reached by knocking down the building they're on or the one next to it.

* Right about where the monkey and fish are, jump into an opening in the walkway and find POW's and a diet shake.

* Sitting on a rooftop of the residential area is your Metal Slug.

* BOSS 4, Big Tank (kind of battleship) : Only the cannons take damage during this battle. If using the Metal Slug, try for the lower cannons first. Use the houses and boulders to aim for the higher guns.


MISSION 5, New York : The townsfolk have been complaining about strange smells and sounds coming from the sewers. Intelligence confirms that a battalion is stationed inside, ready for an invasion. 

* Jump on top of any of the cars, firing downwards. The car will burst in flames, sending you into the sky to reach a lot of bonus items.

* At the end of the street, shoot at the fire escape of the last building for 3 POW's and into the tree for fruits.

* At the underground railroad, shoot into the top of the arch for POW's.

* As soon as one of the 4 trains approaches from the right, fire immediately.

After destroying each one, run to the right to regain any lost ground.

* After marker zero (0), the track bends from here. But before you shoot at the EXIT door, fire at the ceiling. There are 3 separate spots with hostages.

* In the sewers, you see a box with an arrow on it. Find the lever and press (A) to wind it. After 3 turns, an item will drop down with a weapon or bonus.

* BOSS 5, Nuclear Submarine : Surfacing from the sewer slime, the sub attacks with a lot of lightning balls and a thunder cannon. When you see double barrels pop up, prepare for some serious thunder. Fire the Vulcan and bomb it at the same time. 


MISSION 6, Siberian Shipyard : Far from Moscow, the rebel army has secretly established war factories and rebel headquarters.

* Mountainside : the sign with the arrow hides a POW.

* Midboss, Super Soldier : Fully recovered from his wounds of Metal Slug 1, he challenges you to another showdown. The horizontal shots can be ducked. Sometimes, you can knife him once and jump away. Take whatever shots you can in the meanwhile.

* In the submarine factory, after busting the tank, use the platform to release the hostage on the higher platform.

* Small platforms give you access to some of the prisoners on the top level, but it's easier to fight aliens on the lower platform.

* When the 2nd area is clear, turn the crank to release a Laser Rifle.

* 3 POW's are hanging at the top of the screen after the 3rd area.

* A POW is hidden on the short plank in the 4th area.

* BOSS 6, Battle Drone : Use the platform to the left whenever possible. When the rod is exposed, it will prime up for 2 seconds, then fire a bolt. Keep a constant fire when free from the Battle Pods. 

* FINAL BOSS, Mothership : Fear not the various grunts and tanks, they are here to help you.Try using them for cover. Aiming upward from anywhere will hit some section of the ship. The soldiers bring in a Metal Slug later in the battle, just unload it from the truck. After a long and ruthless battle, the Mothership withdraws.

A single player runs through a number of futuristically-theme levels, avoiding obstables - Coca-Cola cans, barriers, green floor tiles (which slow the player's progress), holes etc. - and attempt to reach the finish line before the tight time limit expires.  Progress is aided by springboards - which allow the player to jump over obstacles - and a skateboard, which is unaffected by the green tiles that otherwise slow the player's progress. Bonus points can be earned by kicking the static drinks cans that can be found throughout each level.

The game's name is based from the 1986 FIFA World Cup Finals in Mexico.  However, as this game retains the teams from "Kick and Run", the host nation Mexico are absent from the game.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* All-Stars Team : On the title screen press and hold the start button, wait 8 seconds exactly and release. Do this 3 times and you'll hear a bip-like noise. Insert the coin and go to the team selection screen; put the cursor over Argentina and press and hold start, now choose Argentina. But instead of choosing Argentina you'll get the All-Stars Team.

This game is known in Japan as "Shinnyuushain Tooru-Kun".


The classroom level of Mikie plays the song 'A Hard Day's Night' by The Beatles. The Gym Level plays 'Twist and Shout', the Medley/Russell song made famous by the Fab Four.


- UPDATES -


* Shinnyuushain Tooru-Kun : This is the original version. Mikie has red hair (because we all know that redheads are temperamental troublemakers). Football players are now Bulky Students (Classroom) or Police/Probation Officers (Garden). All of the students wear uniforms, including Mikie. Your classroom teacher wears a white shirt and is somewhat pudgier than his American counterpart. Many of the rooms also have a slightly different appearance and I believe the dance studio teacher wears glasses. Go figure.


* Mikie (High School Graffitti) : Aside from the noticeably different decor in the homeroom (all right, it's only the blackboard), there are several MAJOR differences in this MUCH harder version. Hearts that were normally in glass cases are stacked as piles of three hearts (you only have to time the last heart for Perfects). Furthermore, you can't headbutt in this version, you have to yell, which temporarily stuns enemies EXCEPT FOR your homeroom teacher, who cannot be stopped except by thrown items. Yelling is also much shorter range than headbutting, making timing crucial. Not a version for the weak-reflexed. Most importantly though is that if you take too long in a room, the Classroom teacher can throw what looks like either a necklace or dentures at you. On the plus side, you recover faster from a yell than a headbutt (less lag time) and enemies don't speed up as fast as they do in the other romsets (unfortunately, it seems as though the homeroom teacher will speed up on his own in this romset).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Test mode : hold Start1+Start2 during boot.


* Secret message : In game instruction scene between title screen and demonstration play, input the following code when player character sits on a chair : hold 1P Up + 2P Down then press 1P Start 4 times. "THIS SOFTWARE IS AN ORIGINAL PRODUCT OF KONAMI" should appears.


* You can exit out either of the two Room doors when a room is complete (you can also come back in if need be), but only one door (the one that flashes out) will allow you to continue down towards the garden (the other is where you came in). Still, useful if you're panicking and need a quick exit.


* You can bump the non-heart guarding students out of their desk for points inside the Classroom, but you're only given the points once and this only matters for Step 1 anyways.


* You can headbutt the teacher in the classroom for extra points many, many times, if your timing is good. (Read: Leech)


* Headbutting an enemy vertically in the hallway is extremely difficult, and should only be attempted as a last resort. There just isn't enough room.


* Stun an enemy in the hallway in front of a door, and then smack him with the door for an easy extra 600 points.


* When enemies are moving a little too fast to be comfortable headbutting them, make sure to get them on the horizontal and not the vertical, as it's easier to time your strike.


* If you die after entering a room for the first time (or re-enter a room), the classroom teacher will only delay for about 1 second instead of 3 seconds before entering the room. Be forewarned. You may want to turn around right away and headbutt him as he stands in the doorway.


* The red bucket in the hallway can only hit you on the same horizontal line. Move either up or down (as necessary) to dodge it.


* Controlling and grouping enemies for points is possible on the Garden, but is not easy and cannot be done for very long before they become too fast. Still, it has the most open space of any of the Rooms.

Millipede (c) 1982 Atari.


Millipede is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster-scan video display. The game action takes place on a playfield filled with mushrooms, flowers, and deadly DDT bombs. The player tries to destroy a variety of insects that drop from the top of the screen or enter from the sides of the screen, most of them to attack the player. The player controls a bow-shaped vehicle called the Archer. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy as many objects as possible for a high point score, before the player's lives are all used up.


Player control consists of a Midi Trak-Ball control and a FIRE button. The Archer is moved by rotating the Midi Trak-Ball control. The Archer can be moved in all directions, but only within the bottom fifth of the screen. However, the Archer must move around mushrooms, flowers, and DDT bombs, since these are fixed and not 'transparent' objects. Pressing the FIRE button causes the Archer to emit an arrow that travels upward. The Archer may fire one or many arrows (by holding down the FIRE button constantly). But only one arrow will appear on the screen at a time.


A player may start a game at an advanced level of play and receive bonus points for starting play at that level.


Game play begins with a playfield of randomly placed mushrooms and DDT bombs. A Millipede enters at the top center of the screen and starts snaking its way across the screen. The Millipede changes direction when it runs into a fixed object in the playfield (mushroom, DDT bomb, or flower), or when it reaches the side boundaries of the playfield.


When a segment of the Millipede is shot, it is destroyed and a mushroom appears where that segment was shot. When shot, the Millipede breaks into two smaller Millipedes, each with its own head. When a Millipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it starts back up, but remains within the area of the Archer (the bottom 5th of the screen).


If a Millipede reaches the bottom of the screen without being shot, it releases its tail. This tail changes into a new head. Also to provide the player a challenge, if a Millipede is still alive when it reaches the bottom, new heads will enter the screen almost at the bottom of the sides. More of these heads will appear as time progresses.


An attack wave is complete when all Millipede segments are destroyed. The screen then scrolls down one line. At the 9th attack wave, when the Millipede with only four segments enters from the top of the screen, the screen will scroll down every two seconds. The only way a player can stop the scrolling screen is to shoot a DDT bomb or destroy the entire Millipede. 


It takes four shots to destroy a mushroom. After the fourth attack wave of each wave cycle, the entire playfield of mushrooms changes. Some mushrooms die and new mushrooms grow where there were none before. A mushroom next to a DDT bomb becomes poisoned (See Tips and Tricks below for complete details).


When a Millipede runs into a poisoned mushroom, two things happen: its head changes color, and it changes direction and falls vertically to the bottom of the screen.


DDT bombs explode when hit by an arrow. Any object near the bomb is engulfed by the explosion. Insects are worth three times their normal point value if they are destroyed by the explosion.


Spiders appear in any round. They move in a random pattern on the bottom third of the screen. As the player's score increases, the range of the Spider decreases, until it is confined to the bottom fifth of the screen. Also, more Spiders enter as the game progresses. A Spider destroys any mushroom or flower it moves over. Depending on a special option switch setting, the Spider moves slowly until a player reaches a specific score, and then it speeds up. If the Archer and a Spider collide, both are destroyed.


When a Millipede with fewer than 11 segments appears, an Earwig enters the screen from either side, moving at a relatively slow speed. As the player earns more points, the Earwig's speed increases. If an Earwig passes over a mushroom, it poisons the mushroom.


When a Millipede with fewer than ten segments appears, a Dragonfly enters at the top of the screen. The Dragonfly moves in a zig-zag pattern and its speed increases as the player's score increases. As the Dragonfly moves, it leaves a trail of mushrooms behind.


When a Millipede with fewer than nine segments appears, a Mosquito enters at the top of the screen and flies in a diagonal pattern. The Mosquito's speed increases as the player's score increases. When a Mosquito is destroyed, the screen scrolls up one row. Mosquitos are worth 400 points when destroyed.


Beetles appear randomly after the first wave. They enter from the sides of the screen near the bottom, travel down to the bottom of the screen, and walk at least half way across the bottom. Then the Beetle travels up and exits at the side of the screen. If a Beetle passes over a mushroom, the mushroom changes into a flower. Flowers cannot be destroyed by the Archer. Depending on an option switch setting, the number of Beetles appearing on the screen and the speed of the beetles increase as the player's score increases. When a Beetle is destroyed, the screen scrolls down one row.


Bees may fall from the top of the screen during any round. As the Bee falls, it leaves a trail of mushrooms behind. The Archer must hit a Bee twice to destroy it; the first shot just speeds it up.


An Inchworm may appear when a Millipede with fewer that eleven segments appears. The Inchworm travels from one side of the screen to the other side. It moves slowly until the player's score reaches 80000 points. Then it speeds up. If the Archer destroys the Inchworm, all insects will slow down for about three and one-half seconds.


After a Millipede of one, three, five, seven, or eleven segments has been destroyed, an insect bombing raid occurs. A raid may have only Bees, Dragonflies, Mosquitos, or a mixture of all three.


- TECHNICAL -


Approximately 10,000 units were produced. Millipede came in two different form factors, an upright and a cocktail table, and it was also available as a conversion kit for "Kangaroo", "Dig Dug", and "Arabian". The uprights were by far the most common. They all have control panels with a trackball, although the upright version uses a larger ball than the other ones do. All of the trackballs are prone to wear and tear, but replacement parts are readily available. The upright was in a white cabinet that was rather strangely shaped. It really accented the speaker area in a way that no other games did. The game featured ornate painted sideart of a huge orange bug along with a hunter inside a forest scene. That graphic wasn't just on the sides either, it continued all the way around the front of the machine as well. The control panel was dark and rather plain, it had the trackball, some game instructions, and a few graphics of leaves. The marquee for this title shows a hunter clad in red, firing a longbow at an orange millipede. The cocktail version is black and woodgrained, and has two control panels. It is mildly decorated with light blue graphics under the glass and on the control panels. This was the style of cocktails where both players sat across from each other, and not the side by side style that some other titles used.

- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1982.


Sequels to arcade games can be a 'hit and miss' thing. Taito was able to make a successful sequel to its "Space Invaders" game by releasing "Space Invaders II". Atari also attempted to make a sequel to its hit "Asteroids" called "Asteroids Deluxe". Unfortunately, the sequel was not received well and Atari took a loss with it. Atari had another runaway hit in 1980 called "Centipede". The game basically involved having the player take out insects and mushrooms that dotted the playing screen. Taking another chance, Atari released a sequel in 1982 called Millipede. Fortunately, Millipede received a better reception then "Asteroids Deluxe" did as a sequel and it did fairly well at the arcades. Other games that Atari released such as "Dig Dug", "Gravitar", and "Pole Position" may have also helped the sequel along. The game play was essentially the same as the original.


If you go into test mode, you will see a hidden 'Logg' sprite which refers to the game programmer Ed Logg.


Originally called 'Centipede Deluxe'. Here are the main differences between Millipede and "Centipede" :

* Instead of the Centipede and three enemies, you now have to deal with the Millipede and seven enemies.

* In addition to the Bee dropping mushrooms, the Dragonfly also drops them. The difference between the two enemies is that the Bee goes in a straight line from top to bottom while the Dragonfly zig-zags across the screen from top to bottom.

* Beetles turn mushrooms into flowers which can only be destroyed with DDT bombs or by Spiders.

* On some screens, some of the mushrooms will disappear while others grow in other random places.

* The player character is now an Archer, as it now shoots arrows instead of laser-type shots.

* The screen advances down one level after each round is completed or for each Beetle that is hit. This will reveal other things when a new top level is revealed. Mosquitos cause the screen to advance up by one level.

* Different events are based on how many segments the Millipede starts with (a segment is defined as not being a separate head).

* DDT (a chemical that was banned in the 60's for pest control) bombs have been added to help you take out areas of bugs, flowers, and mushrooms.

* A new bonus setting has been implemented. It works depending on what the machine is set at for gaining bonus Archers. Once you cross that threshold multiple, you can start a new game from that score minus the original bonus score. The score tops out at 300,000 points. You have 30 seconds after your game ends to choose to do this. It works like this :

1) The maximum level a player can start at is one level lower then the last free Archer they received.  For example, you receive a free Archer every 20,000 points. If you achieved a score of 50,000 points, then the last free Archer you received was at 40,000 points. Going one level lower, you can either start with a bonus of 0 or 20,000 points. It works the same for free Archers awarded at 12,000 or 15,000 points.

2) The player will also be allowed to start a new game at a bonus level. Again, depending on what the machine settings are for free Archers will determine this bonus. The bonus will be 0, 1, 2, or 3 times whatever the score required is for a free Archer (i.e. 0, 12,000, 24,000, or 36,000 points to name one). You will have 10 seconds to make a decision.

* There are more score dependent settings for the game. This means more enemies will do different things depending on the player's score.

* Millipede cycles back and forth with head to body ratio instead of just having heads like Centipede does.


James Schneider holds the official record for this game with 6,995,962 points.


A Millipede unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks' and in the 1988 movie 'Arthur 2 - On the Rocks'.


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".


- SCORING -


Millipede (Body) : 10 points

Millipede (Head) : 100 points

Spider : 300, 600, 900, 1200 points (Points increase the closer the Spider is to the player's Shooter when shot)

Earwig : 1000 points

DDT Bomb : 800 points

Dragonfly : 500 points

Mosquito : 400 points

Beetle : 300 points

Bee : 200 points (Takes 2 hits. First hit speeds it up, second hit destroys it)

Inchworm : 100 points

Mushrooms & Poisoned Mushrooms : 1 point (Takes 4 hits to destroy). When the mushroom patch is reset after a player loses a life, each partially destroyed mushroom, poisoned mushroom or flower that is restored awards the player 5 bonus points.


Enemies killed inside DDT blasts are worth 3 times their normal score. The exception to this are Spiders which are worth 1,800 points when killed by DDT and enemies on the raids which are worth their normal (progressive) point values.


Raids : Normal points for the first raiding insect killed. Additional kills on raiding insects are worth 100 points more than the previous one, up to a maximum of 1,000 points each.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hints :

1) Destroy mushrooms near the bottom of the screen.

2) Destroy the DDT bomb when the Millipede is beside it.

3) When a Millipede hits a poisoned mushroom, it changes direction and falls vertically. Anticipate the place the Millipede will fall, because shooting it as it falls destroys all its segments.


* Know Your Enemies : This is the single most important aspect of this game. If you don't know how each of the enemies behave, you won't last long. The enemies are :

1) Millipede (Body and Head) : Goes back and forth across the screen. Will drop to the next level when it encounters a mushroom, flower, DDT bomb, or the side of the game field. It will go all the way to the bottom when it hits a poisoned mushroom.

2) Spider : These appear from the top left or right of the player area. They will either bounce across the player's area at 45 degree angles or bounce in at a 45 degree angle, bounce up and down a couple of times, go to the middle at a 45 degree angle, bounce up and down a couple of times, then finally go to the right side (at a 45 degree angle), bounce up and down, then exit the area. They destroy flowers and mushrooms they pass over. In later stages, multiple Spiders will appear.

3) Dragonfly : These appear when the Millipede begins with less then ten body segments. It goes in a zig-zag pattern from top to bottom leaving a trail of mushrooms in its wake.

4) Bee : These can appear in any attack wave. Their role is identical to that of the Flea in "Centipede" in that they fall from the top of the screen to the bottom, randomly depositing mushrooms along the way. Bees take two shots to kill. The first shot makes the angry and causes them to speed their descent. They will usually appear when you have cleared out most of the mushrooms in the player area.

5) Earwig : These appear when the Millipede begins with less then eleven body segments. Their role is identical to that of the Scorpion in "Centipede" in that they go across the screen and poison all the mushrooms in their path.

6) Beetles : These appear randomly after wave one. They enter from the side of the screen, then go to the bottom. They travel at least halfway along the bottom before going up to their original entry level.  They then exit from the side. All mushrooms in their path are converted to flowers.

7) Mosquitos : These appear when the Millipede begins with less then nine body segments. They fly in a diagonal pattern from the upper left or upper right corners. Hitting them causes the screen to go up one level.

8) Inchworm : These first appear when the Millipede has less then eleven body segments. Hitting them causes all enemies on the screen to slow down for about three seconds.


* The Millipede will start out as a head with eleven body segments in the first wave. Wave two will be a head with ten body segments and a head that enters from the opposite side. Wave three will be a head with nine body segments and two heads that enter from opposite sides. This progression keeps going until wave twelve where you have twelve heads. The cycle will then start over in wave thirteen. This cycle occurs every twelve distinct waves.


* You must clear the first Millipede wave only once. Then, until your score reaches 20,000 points, you must complete each subsequent Millipede wave twice--first as the Millipede moves slowly towards you, then as it moves fast. After your score reaches 20,000 points, each Millipede wave will only need to be completed once.


* Shooting the Millipede can have 2 effects :

1) If you shoot the head, then that part turns into a mushroom and the next segment becomes the new head and the Millipede will travel in the opposite direction (since it hit the new mushroom created).

2) If you shoot the middle of the body, then the segment hit will become a mushroom. The old Millipede will continue in the same direction. The new Millipede will develop a head at the next segment after the break and head off in the opposite direction.


* A good strategy to ensure you destroy the Millipede's in one stroke and to keep the Bees at bay is to create 'mushroom corridors'. Mushroom corridors are basically corridors between two rows of mushrooms where you can funnel the Millipede down and destroy it when it is moving head-first at your shooter.


* In reference to the above 'mushroom corridors', keep in mind that after the fourth wave of each cycle, the mushrooms will undergo a period of growth that determines whether they stay alive or die in accordance with a modified version of the 'life' algorithm. The rules are as follows:

1) Any mushroom with fewer than two neighbors dies, as if by loneliness. 

2) Any mushroom with more than three neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding. 

3) Any mushroom with two or three neighbors lives, unchanged, to the next generation. 

4) Any empty space with exactly three mushroom neighbors comes to life. 

5) Any mushroom adjacent to a DDT bomb becomes poisoned 

6) Any non-poisoned mushroom adjacent to a poisoned mushroom dies 

7) Flowers cannot die, but do count as neighbors towards the growth of mushrooms. 

After this period of growth, you may have to clean up the area since some of your corridors may have been affected by this change. 


* Watch out for the Spiders. They enter at either the top or bottom corners.  Your Archer may be in the way if this happens. In addition to collisions, the Spiders wipe out all mushrooms that are in its path. This can create problems when you are creating mushroom corridors. It can also cause the Bees to appear since you won't have many mushrooms in the player area. In later rounds, multiple Spiders may appear in the player area.


* At the beginning of a round, take a quick look to see how many segments the Millipede has. This will determine the behavior of enemies on that or subsequent rounds.


* Five different times during the cycle of 12 millipede attack waves, you will be bombarded by a swarm of insects. These waves are a major source of points.


After the 2nd wave : Bee raid 

After the 6th wave : Dragonfly raid 

After the 8th wave : Mosquito raid 

After the 10th wave : Bees and Dragonflies raid together 

After the 12th wave : Bees, dragonflies, and mosquitoes raid together 


During these raids, special scoring applies for shooting Bees, Dragonflies, and Mosquitos. Each insect kill of those types (even types not actually swarming, for example a single Bee randomly dropping during the Mosquito swarm) is worth a minimum of 100 points more than the previous kill, to a maximum of 1000 points. Triple scoring from DDT applies as well, so DDTing a Mosquito or Dragonfly will immediately max the raid value at 1000, and DDTing a Bee will register at least 600.


It's very important not to die during one of the raids. If you stay alive, a raid can be worth up to 30,000 points later in the game. To prepare for a raid, don't shoot the last head until any Spiders and Beetles are near the side and leaving the screen. Clear a path to a DDT bomb if possible, so you can use it to kill several insects at once. It will quickly build their value to the maximum of 1000 points each.


Concentrate on one thing--shooting as many bugs as you can. Don't waste time clearing mushrooms until after the raid is over. As your score increases, the length of the raids also increases, making them worth lots of points.


* On the 9th wave, immediately after the mosquito raid, the mushrooms begin scrolling down very quickly, roughly one row every two seconds. They don't stop unless you kill the Millipede, shoot a DDT bomb, or lose a life. You have to do one of these three things quickly, or you'll be overwhelmed by mushrooms on the bottom.


First try to hit a DDT bomb. It's a good idea to clear a path to one before the wave starts. If you can't use a DDT, try to kill the millipede before the mushrooms get too low. As a last resort, die on purpose.


The scrolling wave follows the raid of Mosquitoes. If you can shoot a lot of Mosquitoes in the raid, the mushrooms scroll way up the screen, and you'll have plenty of time to kill the Millipede while the mushrooms come back down. Remember, if you scroll the mushrooms way up the screen, you won't be able to fire very fast. You'll have to take single shots, making sure you hit the millipede each time.


* You can have a maximum of 4 DDT bombs on the screen at any given time. Wait until either the Millipede is right next to one or there is a heavy concentration of enemies before setting it off.


* Beetles can cause a lot of problems if they aren't dealt with quickly. Of course, if you have your mushroom corridor set up, they may be a blessing. Since they create relatively indestructible flowers in their path, this would help prevent you from shooting them accidently. Of course, you still have to worry about the Spiders and DDT bombs.


* Keep track of where the Earwigs move across the screen. As soon as the Millipede hits a poisoned mushroom, it will immediately head for the bottom of the screen. The only way to stop this headlong plunge is to shoot it in the head. In the later rounds, it is not uncommon to have multiple Earwigs going across the screen. They also provide the most points in the game.


* If you get unlucky and let the Millipede into your area, you need to destroy it before it gets to the bottom of the player area. Once it reaches the bottom, it will ascend again and remain in the player area. If it does reach the bottom of the player area, another head will come out from the opposite side to start its back and forth march across the screen. This will continue until you destroy all the Millipede parts in the player area or until your Archer is destroyed.


* If your Archer gets destroyed, all partially-destroyed mushrooms and all poisoned mushrooms are reset. Flowers created by beetles are also changed back into mushrooms. You then start at the beginning of the wave you got killed on.


* Depending on the difficulty the machine is set up at, the following events occur :

1) At easy, the Spider moves slowly up to 10,000 points. At hard, the Spider moves slowly up to 5,000 points.

2) At easy, the Beetle moves slowly up to 400,000 points and four Beetles appear in each round after 500,000 points. At hard, the Beetle moves slowly up to 300,000 points and four Beetles appear in each round after 350,000 points.

3) Regardless of setting, the Inchworm will move faster after the player reaches 80,000 points.

4) All other enemies move at their same speeds.

The plot of the movie : A man's body and soul are stolen and used as part of a demon castle. What's left becomes Cyber Ninja. He teams up with the chi students whose cyber-earmuffs show matching red symbols. They fill their swords with ammunition, grab some neo-retro-cyber-antique guns and attack the demon robot expendable ninja squad. Each fight is won by whichever side uses more gratuitous special effects. They slay the Tron-like hover droids, who are destroyed in their shame. There's a showdown with a white-armored guy with dreadlocks, who is later reincarnated by the eclipse and a lot of multicolored lightning. After killing the make-up wearing effeminate spider person, the chi school fires a giant gun at the demon castle spider cyber robot. It blows up.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Mirai Ninja - Keigumo Kinin Gaiden : G.S.M. Namco 1) on 21/12/1988.

Missile Command (c) 1980 Atari.


Missile Command is a 1- or 2-player game with a color monitor. The game depicts an Armageddon style war in which players defend their bases and cities with antiballistic missiles (ABMs). The enemy - the game computer - launches incoming waves of attack missiles. These weapons may be either individual or branching attack missiles. In addition, the enemy occasionally launches missiles from a fast-moving 'killer' satellite or from bombers. The enemy also launches 'smart' missiles that usually avoid explosions.


Players receive varying numbers of points for intercepting attack missiles, for having unused missiles still in their bases' arsenals, and for having their cities undamaged after a missile wave.


The play mode begins when either start pushbutton is pressed. The mode ends when the player's last city is destroyed.


The 3 bases - Alpha, Delta and Omega - each have 10 ABMs ready to be fired. Players must be careful to fire the missiles more or less evenly from among those bases, because no more missiles are granted until the screen resets in preparation for a new wave of attack missiles. If the enemy missiles strike a city or base, the colorful buildings or base will change to the solid color of the landscape.


The game continues until all cities are destroyed. Missile Command has no operator-selectable fixed time length. Thus a highly skilled player can play longer than the novice.


During the second wave, a 'killer' satellite and/or bomber will appear on the screen, moving quickly and launching attack missiles at the bases and cities. Players get bonus points for shooting down the satellites or bombers.


The general approach for getting high point scores is fairly quickly discovered : try to launch your ABMs when the enemy missiles have just appeared at the top of the screen. Then they are clustered together, where one ABM can usually destroy several enemy missiles. In the later more advanced waves, players can lay out a blanket of explosions.

- TRIVIA -


Released in June 1980.

Licensed to Sega for Japan market.


Missile Command, was an immensely popular arcade game that combined great game play with a rather chilling message about the dangers of war. Approximately 20,000 units were produced.


Originally called 'Armaggedon', Missile Command was designed at a time that the United States and Russia were locked in a fierce 'cold war'. Missile Command was originally going to have a large status panel as part of its marquee which indicated the status of the bases and cities but it was eliminated when the designers learned that players lost track of on-screen gameplay when they looked up at the panel. There is a picture of a prototype cabinet with the status panel on page 60 of the book 'High Score : The Illustrated History of Electronics Games, 2nd Edition'.


* The Creation of Missile Command : The idea for Missile Command began with a magazine story about satellites that captured the attention of Atari's president, who passed the clipping to Lyle Rains. Rains asked Dave Theurer to lead the effort in creating the classic, action-packed arcade game.


* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters : Recalling the birth of Missile Command, Dave Theurer said : "The request was for a game where there are missiles attacking the California coast and the player is defending the coast. They said, take it from here and write up a game proposal. In the first proposal it was the California coast. "Part of creating a great game is knowing what to strip away. Some of the first baggage the developers dropped was geographic identifications because of the frightful scenario of the game. And then they stripped away more. Dave Theurer : "The original suggestion was for there to be a scanning radar, but I immediately said, no way! It would be just too hard for the player because he wouldn't be able to see what was going on. We chucked that idea. And when we first developed the game, we added railroads to transport missiles from the cities to the missile bases. That got to be too complicated and people got confused... if you get too complicated, people won't play. We also had submarines for a while but that didn't work out so we ripped them out, too.".


The smart bombs presented the most difficult challenge in writing the code for Missile Command. Dave Theurer : "These little diamond-shape guys can evade your explosions. The only way you can kill them is if the explosion starts out right on top of them. Programming that was the hardest part. They had to be intelligent because the little guy had to look around on the screen to see what he had to avoid and he had to figure out the best path to go around what there was to avoid. Of course, if I made it too smart, then the player couldn't kill it and they'd be guaranteed instant death. So it had to be a fine line between smarter than the dumb missiles, yet not totally unkillable.".


Nerves of steel is the way Rich Adam one of the Missile Command team members described his coworker : "Dave Theurer was extremely detail oriented, very thorough, very disciplined. He had nerves of steel, would never get rattled, and worked tirelessly. You need nerves of steel because if your code doesn't work it's your fault, something inside that code is not correct. There's really nowhere to hide. The real Achilles' heel with a lot of software people, I  believe, is that they spin their wheels and they go through this denial phase : 'It can't be my code! How could anything possibly be wrong with it? My code is so straightforward!' Well, it's so straightforward you might not have thought of a nuance. So, that's why it takes nerves of steel, I think. The work requires sort of a cold, methodical approach to the software."


* Popular from the Start : Even before it shipped, Missile Command had intense fans. Speaking of the play the game got just within the labs of Atari, Ed Rotberg said : "There were guys there that would literally have to worship that game for hours at a time. Their hands were sweating, and it was a definite adrenaline rush." Describing some of the dedicated players at Atari, Dave Theurer said : "We were in the same building as the consumer division and there were a couple of guys from that division who would come down and spend all day playing Missile Command. I don't know what they did upstairs, but they would spend the entire day playing the game."


* The Great 25-Cent Escape : The escape from reality could sometimes have frightful consequences. The horrifying subject matter of Missile Command had an impact on the developers. Dave Theurer : "It was pretty scary. During the project and for 6 months after the project, I'd wake up in a cold sweat because I'd have these dreams where I'd see the missile streak coming in and I'd see the impact. I would be up on top of a mountain and I'd see the missiles coming in, and I'd know it would be about 30 seconds until the blast hit and fried me to a crisp.".

Steve Calfee : "Everybody I know who really got into the game had nightmares about nuclear war.". The game was nearly shipped with a name that carried the message of the end of the world... Armageddon. Steve Calfee : "We had this big thing about the name of the game. From the beginning, it was called Armageddon. The management, themselves, didn't know what the word meant and they thought none of the kids would. Then we went through this big thing of naming it. Engineering loved the name Armageddon, and we always wanted to call it that. From the very top came the message, 'We can't use that name, nobody'll know what it means, and nobody can spell it.'" Placing the game in the context of the previous decade, Ed Rotberg said : "The thing about Missile Command is that the world was not nearly as stable politically as it is now. There is a little bit of a  spooky message in that whole game when you have that final cloud at the end.".


Victor Ali holds the official record for this game on 'Marathon' settings with 80,364,995 points.

Roy Shildt holds the official record for this game on 'Tournament' settings

with 1,695,265 points.


Hacks of this game are known as "Super Missile Attack" and "Missile Combat".


A Missile Command unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1991 movie 'Terminator 2 - Judgment Day' and in the 1995 movie 'Species'.


A Missile Command upright cabinet appears in the Judas Priest music video 'Freewheel Burning'. The game's THE END screen appears at the end of the video.


In 1982, a multi-player sequel was planned but never released. This game would have have been identical to the first except with twice as many cities and batteries and the players cooperating to save each other cities from the onslaught.


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".


- SCORING -


Points are awarded for destroying enemy missiles, ships and planes :

Missile : 25 points

Killer Satellite : 100 points

Bomber : 100 points

Smart Bomb : 125 points


Bonus points are awarded at the end of each stage for any cities and missiles remaining :

Unused missiles : 5 points each

Saved Cities : 100 points each


A scoring multiplier based on the wave being played is displayed at the start of each level :

Waves 1 and 2 have 1x scoring.

Waves 3 and 4 have 2x scoring.

Waves 5 and 6 have 3x scoring.

Waves 7 and 8 have 4x scoring.

Waves 9 and 10 have 5x scoring.

Waves 11 and above have 6x scoring.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* A sound tactic used by many is to fire a sweeping barrage of missiles across the top of the screen at the start of a wave thereby taking out many of the first shots fired by the enemy.


* There are usually two main attack waves per stage. Just when it looks like things have calmed down, another assault commences. Repeating the strategy above is a good idea.


* The enemy bombs which avoid your missiles are usually fooled by a couple of quick missiles being fired on opposite sides of the bomb, but overlapping. The bomb cannot then escape.

M.I.A. - Missing in Action (c) 01/1989 Konami.


M.I.A. is a direct sequel to 1985's 'Green Beret' and, like it's predecessor is a horizontally scrolling jump and shoot game for one or two players. Special forces soldiers must penetrate several enemy-packed combat zones to reach a POW compound. Once there, the must infiltrate it, rescue the POWs held there, and then escort them to a through a final enemy-packed level to the rescue helicopter that awaits at the end. Unlike 'Green Beret', the two-player game in M.I.A. sees both players fight side-by-side instead of the alternate approach of the original.


The game consists of six stages;

* War-torn battlefield

* Airstrip

* Jungle

* Rail Yard

* PoW Base

* Escort the PoW's to the Helicopter


The first four stages are presented in random order and may also be "mirrored", so players battle right-to-left instead of left-to-right. This vastly increases variety to the game and adds replay value. The PoW and helicopter stages are always the last two stages. At the end of each level, the players must fight off a flurry of enemy troops and destroy gun emplacements and watch towers. Certain sections of each stage offer players a different route, with both platforms and underground tunnels that can be utilized and explored. 


As with 'Green Beret', players start each level carrying only a combat knife. Specific enemy troops carry weapons which are dropped when the soldier is killed and can be picked up by the players. The weapons are always carried by soldiers wearing red uniforms, and range from an assault rifle, grenades, a flame-thrower or a bazooka. Players can carry more than one weapon and can cycle through them as needed. Each collected weapon has only a limited supply of shots. 


After rescuing the PoW's on the sixth stage, players must escort as many of the escapees as possible to a waiting helicopter, and must get at least one PoW safely aboard the chopper to complete the mission and start a new set of stages.

Monster Bash (c) 1982 Sega.


MONSTER BASH is a fascinating cartoon theme game featuring colorful graphics in three exciting scenes of hunt-and-hide adventure. Light-hearted, suspenseful music and audio sounds add to the fun, and heighten player interest and intrigue.


DRACULA'S HOUSE

The player-hero of the game is LITTLE RED, a wily, red-headed boy who chases Dracula throughout his five-story haunted house. Up and down staircases and through Warp Doors leading to secret passageways, Little Red zaps defending bats while attempting to light candles in certain rooms. When a candle is lit a Magic Sword is energized with mystical powers. Little Red must touch the flashing Magic Sword to gain SuperZap power... only a SuperZap will defeat the sly Dracula.


FRANKENSTEIN'S CASTLE

Little Red enters the eerie castle of the hulking Frankenstein. He pursues Frankenstein around his six-story castle while avoiding the fierce Wolfmen.  The tricky Wolfmen can be zapped, but be careful, they can duck under the zap and attack Little Red. Fewer candles are now available to be lit. Warp doors to secret passageways can be used only when they flash. Special jump-down zones allow Little Red to jump down several levels at once, eliminating any Wolfmen in the way as he descends, but Frankenstein can only be defeated with a SuperZap.


CHAMELEON MAN'S GRAVEYARD

The greatest challenge yet... to dispatch the sneaky Chameleon Man and his horde of Spiders.  Entering the spooky graveyard, Little Red finds that only one candle is available for lighting which is found in a crypt guarded by giant Spiders. Chameleon Man changes his color to match that of the background and thus becomes invisible. Little Red must pass over one of the Color-Change Spots to change the background color making Chameleon Man visible again. Chameleon Man can do away with Little Red with a flick of his long tongue. Chameleon Man can only be done in with a SuperZap.

Moon Base [Upright model] (c) 1979 Nichibutsu.


A licenced sequel to the legendary "Space Invaders". Moon Base's gameplay is virtually identical to the original game, with the player once again moving a laser base back and forth along the bottom of the screen, shooting endless waves of aliens marching downwards towards the player. Once again flying saucers can be shot for extra points.


Some minor enhancements over the original include the wave number now being indicated on the player's laser bases, and the inclusion of the infamous 'color cellophane overlay', added to give the impression of coloured alien sprites.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your base will be in the bottom left corner of the screen, below the buildings. Your goal is to blast the invaders into dust. Keep in mind that once the invaders make it to either the right or left edge of the screen, they will drop down a row and head in the opposite direction. You should plan your strategy to prevent them from making it to an edge.


* A good strategy is to start blasting out the columns on the opposite edge of movement. If the invaders are moving right, then start blasting out the leftmost columns first. This way, their return trip is longer and you have more time to deal with them.


* Do not attempt to hit the invaders dead center. They fire their laser bombs from dead center and your shots will collide, wasting your shot and letting them move closer to an edge.


* Speaking of shots, you can only have one shot out at a time so make it count.


* Use your buildings to your advantage. ''Peek'' around buildings to get shots and blast a hole in the middle of your buildings to give you protection while you knock out columns of invaders. Keep in mind, this protection will only last about 2 columns before the invaders blow open a hole wide enough to destroy your base.


* Every other wave of invaders starts one row lower. Eventually, the waves will start one row above your buildings. Be prepared to do some fast shooting to keep them from getting any lower because once they reach your level, the game is over.


* When you are down to taking out the last invader on a wave, that invader will zip across the screen. The strange thing is that the invader travels faster going left to right then going right to left.  Keep this in mind when trying to shoot it.


* The mystery saucer (or UFO) will appear at random times. If you have a good shot at it, try to hit it. Don't go out of your way, however, to go after it; it isn't worth the risk or time wasted.


* When you get a wave that has spaces in-between the invaders, be prepared for heavier fighting. These gaps are left to accommodate the ''new'' invaders that will appear. These new invaders appear when you hit one of the regular invaders and it splits.


* The blinking saucer can only be hit when it is solid. Time your shot right and you may be able to hit it.


* Another thing is if you are getting too successful at blasting the invaders, a Mystery Ship will show up and start to deposit more invaders for you to take out.


* The Hidden Message Trick. To get the hidden message, you must do the following :

1) When the demo starts, you need to press the following keys at the same time on the machine :  LEFT, RIGHT, FIRE, 1 PLAYER START, 2 PLAYER START.

2) Continue to press these keys rapidly as fast as you can.

3) If you are successful, the message ('TAITO CORP.') will appear below the high score. The ''spelling error'' on "Space Invaders" is corrected.


* Shot Counting Trick : To get 300 every time you hit the mystery saucer. It is named the ''Furrer Trick'' named after Eric Furrer who perfected it. To do this trick, perform the following :

1) Once the new level begins, start counting the shots from your base.

2) When you have fired 22 shots, stop shooting and wait for the mystery saucer.

3) Use the 23rd shot to blast the mystery saucer.

4) After this, start counting shots again, this time count only to 14.

5) Use the 15th shot to hit the mystery saucer.

6) Continue using the 14 shot rule until the level is finished.

7) At the next wave, start with the 22 shot rule, then use the 14 shot rule to finish that wave.

8) Remember, all shots count regardless of hits or misses.


* Eric Furrer writes : The ''Shot Counting'' trick from "Space Invaders" works in Space Invaders Part II but the flashing mystery ship can throw you off. You can count 22 like in Space Invaders, but you must count 14 or 29 from the 300 to the next 300, even if you hit the flashing mystery ship. Also, in Space Invaders Part II, the mystery ship drops invaders, so he's harder to target. In Space Invaders Part II, I just do the first 22, and concentrate on leaving the left lower invader as the last invader to kill for the 1000pt fireworks bonus.


* Rainbow Trick : If the final aliens you kill are in the bottom 2 rows, you get a fireworks display and 500 bonus points. If it happens to be the bottom, left-most alien, you get fireworks and a 1000 point bonus.


* Extra Life : The machine will award you a bonus life during the intermission if you were able to wipe out the previous screen in 55 shots or less. Of course, this is very difficult to do. However, you can take advantage of the famous 8-bit rollover bug by firing OVER 255 shots, thereby rolling over the shot counter! Just make sure you can wipe out the remaining invaders in under 55 shots after you roll the counter over.


* Preset Mode : Space Invaders Part II provided a way the operator could enter his/her name each time the machine was turned on.

1) Turn preset mode ON in the DIP switch.

2) Insert one credit.

3) Depress one player select button 'Preset Mode' will be displayed on screen.

4) Depress one player select button again to increase score until previous high-score is beaten. Note : If you press the two player select button you can skip the starting level as well.

5) Depress Fire button to start game. After all bases have been destroyed the alphabet will be displayed on screen. A new name may now be entered.

6) Turn preset mode OFF in the DIP switch to re-establish game mode.

Moon Cresta (c) 1980 Gremlin.


MOON CRESTA is a 1 or 2-player game in which players may compete for highest score against the game computer. Each time a player is hit by an alien, the game switches to his opponent's sequence.


The object is to destroy as many of the descending aliens as possible. To accomplish this the player is given a three stage multi-fire Warship. He begins with the first stage, firing a single laser at the enemy. If he is successful in eliminating the first 4 sets of aliens, he is given an opportunity to dock his first stage onto the second within a specific time limit (the sooner he unites the stages, the higher is his awarded score).


Once docked, the stages combine their firing power, so the first (1 laser) adds to the second (2 lasers) giving the player a total of 3 usable lasers as the game continues.


The player then must face 2 more sets of aliens and a shower of meteors, after which he has a chance to dock again, this time uniting with the third stage for a combined fire power of five lasers. If he is able to defeat the last two sets of aliens intact, the entire sequence begins again. The game continues with increasing difficulty until the entire warship is destroyed. When the warship is hit the player continues with whatever stages remain. If his score reaches 30,000 he is awarded a free game and his score continues to accumulate.

Released in September 1980. Manufactured by Gremlin under license from Nichibutsu.


This game is known in US as "Eagle" (Licensed to Centuri for manufacture 10/1980).

2 bootlegs of this game are known as "Fantazia" and "Moon War".

- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is relatively simple. Each alien (except meteors and arrows) come in 2 different colors for each screen.

Eyes (Break in half) : 50 points

Eyes (Destroy other half) : 100 points

Flies : 30 points

Birds : 60 points

Fireballs : 200 points

Arrow Ships : 100 points


Docking is a big way to increase your score. You get the time remaining from 30 seconds multiplied by 100 for your docking bonus.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, all three stages of your ship will come from the bottom of the screen. After going halfway up, the ship on top separates from the other 2 and it settles onto the bottom of the screen ready for battle.


* Remember, you can only keep one set of shots in the 'air' at one time. This means you need to plan your shots out so you don't end up with a lot of misses when the aliens decided to come after your ship.


* In the later screens, the aliens start moving much quicker and you have to be on your toes to keep up with them and avoid being taken out.


* Although the aliens do not fire, they still can cause a lot of hate and discontent by their wild maneuvering. There is no real safe place on the screen from the aliens since they go into the lower corners of the screen, reappear from the bottom after they have apparently 'left' the screen, or just appear right above your ship.


* In the earlier waves, you have to split apart 2 eyes before the rest automatically split and come after your ship. In the later screens, the eyes automatically split upon entering the screen. That means eight instead of four aliens you have to deal with.


* If you manage to dock all three ships together, you will have a lot of firepower (5 shots at once) to send out. Here are some ways, unfortunately, you can lose ships and what ships are lost :

1) Besides the aliens, docking is the second way people lose a lot of ships. The only ship destroyed is the ship attempting to dock.

2) If an alien hits any part of your ships (if all stages are joined), only the stage hit is lost. This can create an amusing circumstance if you lose stage II and you only have stages I and III to fight with.


* Don't worry if you lose stage I early in the game. One has to be very skilled to fight four screens with stage I. Stage II is the best stage to fight with. It is a small target plus it has enough firepower to defend itself. Stage III on the other hand, is just a lumbering junkyard. The lasers are too spread out to do much good plus there is a very wide-open area in the middle for aliens to hit.


* The bird stages present the most challenge of the aliens. They appear and disappear at will. Sometimes they will appear right next to your ship so on these stages, be extra alert. If you see one disappear and don't hear the familiar bird chirp of it reappearing, assume it is on the screen somewhere still.


* The best place to 'hide' during the fireball stage is in the lower right corner. The fireballs will not hit your ship in this corner. You can do hit and runs by moving your ship out, shooting at a fireball, then going back to the corner again.


* During the arrow screen, the aliens will hover around the top, then turn into arrows and attempt to ram your ship. In the later screens, they won't even hover but just try to ram your ship.


* Your goal is to make it to 30,000 points so you can have a fresh ship waiting in case you lose all the stages of your present ship.


* Docking isn't that hard to do. After finishing off a wave just before the docking stage, try to center your ship on the screen. That way, all you have to do is move that ship left or right to successfully dock. You want to avoid using the thrusters unless your ship is in extreme peril. The docking bonus can be the most amount of points you score in the game. If you happen to miss a dock, then you will continue the next set of screens with the ship that failed to dock.

Moon Patrol (c) 1982 Irem.


The player controls a moon buggy, viewing it from the side, that travels over the moon's surface. While driving it must avoid obstacles such as craters and mines. The buggy is also attacked by UFOs from above and tanks on the ground.


- TECHNICAL -


The Moon Patrol cabinet is a similar design to the one used on "Joust", but with a slightly thicker control panel. This title features painted sideart (a scene showing a moon buggy being attacked, which is done in several shades of blue), and uses a horizontal monitor. The marquee shows another moon scene (this one done up in Marvel comics style graphics) of a yellow moon buggy attacking a hovercraft, with a purple space castle in the background (All of those things are different colors than the ones actually in the game, they probably neglected to show the graphic artist the actual game). The control panel uses a single 2-Way joystick which is mounted centrally, fire and jump buttons are on either side (meaning you can play this title with either hand).

Moon Patrol was one of the earliest linear side-scrolling shoot'em ups and the first game to feature parallax scrolling.


CAST OF CHARACTERS :


PLAYER CHARACTER - MOON BUGGY : Your vehicle across the rugged lunar terrain is a specially designed moon buggy. It comes with six wheels on three specially mounted axles that contain especially absorbent shocks which allow the buggy to glide across the uneven landscape of the moon. The wheels of the buggy can be utilized to create short hops, which allow the buggy to jump over pits and other hazardous obstacles that can't be removed in time. It is also equipped with a roof mounted gun for anti-air fire and a forward mounted cannon. The anti-air gun can fire up to four bullets on the screen at one time, while the cannon can only project one bullet at a time. The buggy is destroyed by impact with an obstacle, getting hit by alien craft bombs, or falling into a lunar pit.


ENEMIES ON THE GROUND :

1) Craters and Rocks - Throughout the course of driving on the moon, you will encounter natural terrain obstacles that you must overcome. Nothing more can be done about craters than jumping over them. Most craters are spaced out, but a few come in rapid succession of one another, so jumps must be timed carefully. In addition to craters, you will come across rocks on the landscape. Most rocks are easily dispatched with one shot from your cannon. Sometimes, two rocks occur back to back. If you're fast enough, you can destroy them both. Otherwise, you may opt to jump over the pair. Small rocks lie below the height of your cannon fire. They can only be destroyed if the shot from your cannon detonates near the rock. Otherwise, the shot will sail harmlessly over the rock. When in doubt, jump over the rocks to be safe.

2) Land Mines - These small objects which flash white and red make their first appearance after point J in the beginner course. Like pits, they can not be destroyed and must be jumped over. They tend to occur in rapid succession, so it is recommended that you travel no faster than regular speed until you are an expert player. When two mines are approximately two buggy lengths apart, it is important to jump over the first one considerably early so that you don't land on the second, and have enough time to jump off the ground before you reach it.

3) Boulders - At certain points along your patrol, the elevation of the moon's surface rises. The first such occurrance is between points P and Q in the beginner course. While you are driving uphill, it is not uncommon to encounter boulders rolling down towards your buggy. Like rocks, these boulders can be rendered harmless with your cannon. Even the small boulders present little challenge thanks to the incline of the surface elevating them to the level of your cannon. But be prepared for a difficult jump if too many come at you at once and you don't have enough time to destroy them all.

4) Tanks - These first appear after point U in the beginner course. They are stationary, and typically fire one bullet at a time in your direction. Their bullets and the shots from your cannon cancel each other out, so you must immediately fire again in order to hit the tank. Any delay on your part will result in the tank firing once more, preventing you from destroying the tank before you reach it. Tanks can be jumped over if necessary.

5) Rocket Cars - The first of these appears after A in the champion course. It will trail behind you until it is ready to strike. Stay fast, and don't do anything until it begins to approach you. When it's half way between you and the edge of the screen, jump up and let it sail underneath you. Fire as soon as you land to destroy it for 500 points. 

6) Space Plants - A strange type of vegetation exists on the moon, favoring to make their homes in the craters of the lunar surface. They bob in and out of the craters in an effort to catch whatever they can grab. These space plants first appear shortly before point H in the champion course. A shot from the cannon is enough to render the space plant harmless, but the crater must still be leaped over. Attempting to leap over a crater that still contains a space plant can be a dangerous gamble if not timed perfectly.


ENEMMIES IN THE AIR

Alien Craft : There are 3 types of craft that the enemy employs when trying to defeat you from overhead. They all appear in groups ranging from 2 to 4.

1) Regular Craft - These weave back and forth dropping bombs on the buggy. The bombs can be destroyed with your anti-air gun, but they make difficult targets. If this craft is left on the screen for too long in later levels, it may fly down to collide with your buggy.

2) Elliptical craft - These behave nearly identical to the regular craft. They drop bombs on you with increasing accuracy. The long you remain at a particular speed, the better their shots will get, so make sure to mix your speed up in order to confuse them. Sometimes, you can jump at the last minute and avoid getting hit if the bomb is about to hit the back of your buggy.

3) Tri-orb craft - This craft, made of three circles bound together, is the deadliest of them all. Rather than dropping normal bombs at the buggy, they pitch terrain deforming grenades at the path ahead of you. You must watch the trajectory of their small flashing grenades and anticipate when you might need to jump as a result of the newly formed pit left by their grenade's impact with the ground. Like the bombs, the grenades can be shot, but they are even harder to hit.


Some graphical glitches :

- Shoot an alien ship as it falls and it remains on the screen, with its point total.

- Bombs dropped in pits explode on the surface

- Occasionally you'll miss an enemy you appear to hit, but it works the other way around too

- Occasionally the enemy missiles will hit your very edge and nothing will happen. Don't get too used to this happening, though!

- When you jump but still fall in a pit, you always make it halfway between the edge before falling in.


The attract mode course uses its own unique course of gameplay. The screen, however, says 'Beginner course' at the top when the moon buggy is parked at the moon base. The enemies encountered in attract mode are as follows :

(Moon base)

Large (double) rock, Large crater, 2 space plants (the second space plant has a rock adjacent to it), Large crater, Small crater, 2 tanks

(Point A)

Uphill climb with rolling boulders, Formation of 3 regular alien crafts, Formation of 3 tri-orb crafts

(Point B)

Downhill descent with formation of 3 elliptical alien crafts

(Point C)

Rocket car, Large crater and small crater adjacent to each other

(Unfortunately the moon buggy always falls into the large crater that follows the rocket car, so technically the attract mode course ends there. Sometimes the alien craft between points A and C would defeat the moon buggy; other times the moon buggy would mistime its jump over the rocket car. The land mines do not appear in the attract mode).


Mark Robichek holds the official record for this game with 1,214,600 points.


A Moon Patrol unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks' and in the 1984 movie 'The Karate Kid'.


A Bootleg of this game is called "Moon Ranger".


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (R-Type : Irem Game Music - 28XA-199) on 25/01/1988.

Enemies that appear in later stages also appear in the attract mode. If you watch the attract mode carefully, you'll learn how to deal with these adversaries.


Moon Patrol is primarily divided into 2 courses; the Beginner course and the Champion course. Each course is divided into 26 sections labeled A through Z. Each section is organized into 4 groups of 5 and 1 group of 6 at the very end. At the end of each group, your time is compared to the average time for potential bonus points.


BEGINNER COURSE

 

In the very first stretch, you will encounter 3 small craters, and 2 rocks. Jump over all of the craters and fire your cannon at the rocks. 


Point A 

By the time you drive over point A, 2 of the first alien crafts will appear overhead. They will be joined by two of the elliptical crafts. A rock will appear towards the end. 


Point B 

2 more crafts appear while a rock approaches your buggy. A few more rocks and a crater will follow. 


Point C 

3 elliptical crafts will appear. Destroy them for a 500 point bonus while you jump over the 2 craters and destroy the rock. 


Point D 

2 tri-orbs will introduce themselves. Be careful of the craters that their grenades might make. They are quickly followed by 2 regular crafts. One rock and one crater precedes the end.


F - J


Point E 

The section begins with 2 tri-orbs followed by 2 elliptical crafts. A crater and rock appear towards the end. 


Point F 

More difficult obstacles appear, such as large craters, double rocks that must be fired on twice, and small rocks that must be hit by the explosion of the cannon shot. 


Point G 

2 craft appear while you jump over large craters and destroy a few rocks that get in your way. 


Point H 

There are simply 2 tri-orbs and 2 regular crafts in this section. 


Point I 

The first group of three tri-orbs will appear. Destroy them all for 500 points. Then a rapid succession of craters and rocks will occur, including double and small rocks. You may wish to slow down towards the end to deal with them all. 


K - O


Point J 

This section introduces you to land mines, the small objects that flash white and red. Like craters, they can not be destroyed and must be jumped over. They tend to occur in rapid succession, so it is recommended that you travel no faster than regular speed until you are an expert player.


Point K 

More land mines in this section. When 2 land mines are approximately 2 buggy lengths apart, it is important to jump over the first one considerably early so that you don't land on the second, and have enough time to jump off the ground before you reach it. 


Point L 

Many of the land mines you encounter here come in pairs, but they are no more difficult to jump at regular speed than single mines. 


Point M 

Space craft resume their attack and this time 4 of the regular type appear to attack. Destroy them all for an 800 point bonus. This is followed by 3 elliptical crafts, worth 500 bonus points if they are all destroyed. 


Point N 

4 tri-orbs appear, followed by 3 elliptical crafts. If you can destroy them all, you'll net a 1300 point bonus.


P - T


Point O 

A quad of tri-orbs start off this section, followed by 3 regular crafts. 


Point P 

This section is the first uphill climb that you encounter. Boulders of all three sizes will fall down the hill in no larger groups than pairs. Even the smallest boulders should be easy to shoot. 


Point Q 

4 elliptical craft appear. Be aware that their bombs don't need to travel as far in order to hit you. Also keep your eyes open for the large craters and double rock formations that show up. 


Point R 

As you begin to descend downhill, a pair of both regular space crafts will appear and bomb you from overhead. 


Point S 

3 regular crafts appear near simultaneously with 3 tri-orb craft. Stay alert to newly formed craters. 


U - Z


Point T 

A rapid succession of craters and double rocks appear. Take this section at the normal speed until you feel comfortable speeding up. 


Point U 

As soon as the craters and rock end, you will encounter your first 2 tanks. 4 more tanks are waiting for you after a large crater. Fire rapidly to overcome their bullets and destroy them. 


Point V 

A series of 4 large craters precedes an uphill climb, complete with rolling boulders.


Point W 

4 regular craft and 3 elliptical crafts appear while you're positioned closer to the sky.


Point X 

3 regular crafts are followed by 3 tri-orb crafts. 


Point Y 

3 more tri-orb crafts and 3 elliptical crafts fire from overhead while you must avoid a final series of craters and rocks to reach the end of the beginner course.




CHAMPION COURSE


A - E


3 regular craft and 3 elliptical craft bomb you from overhead at the start of the champion course. 


Point A 

Your first tangle with a rocket car will occur. It will trail behind you until it is ready to strike. Stay fast, and don't do anything until it begins to approach you. When it's half way between you and the edge of the screen, jump up and let it sail underneath you. Fire as soon as you land to destroy it. 


Point B 

A few tanks occur among craters and rock. The last tank in this section is positioned just after a large crater. It's difficult to destroy both the tank's bullet and the tank, so fire at the bullet and leap over the crater and the tank in one jump. 


Point C 

More tanks appear with short breaks of craters and rocks. 


Point D 

4 regular crafts fly in while you must continue to navigate over several deep craters and clear the rocks in your way. Destroy all of the crafts for 800 bonus points. 


F - J


Point E 

3 pairs of tri-orbs appear, providing a near constant shower of grenades. No bonus points are awarded for destroying all of the crafts because they are considered pairs. 


Point F 

A tricky succession of craters and rocks occur. They frequently occur back to back, requiring you to clear the rock in front of the crater before jumping, or forcing you to delay your jump so that you can destroy the rock behind the crater. Slow the buggy down if your jumps are landing too close to the next obstacle. 


Point G 

4 tri-orb crafts are accompanied by 4 regular crafts for a total potential bonus of 1600 points. At the very end of this section, you will be introduced to space plants. Even if you manage to destroy them, remember to jump over the craters. 


Point H 

3 of the regular and elliptical crafts appear among more craters and rocks. 


Point I 

4 tri-orb crafts arrive. Destroy them as quickly as possible before the terrain gets more difficult up ahead. Among the craters and rocks are space plants that must be dealt with. Slow the buggy down towards the end.


K - O


Point J 

This section starts off with an uphill climb. Boulders now appear more frequently and groups of three are not uncommon. Do not be determined to destroy them all. Leap over a set if they prove too difficult to shoot in time. 


Point K 

4 regular crafts and 3 elliptical crafts stream onto the screen during your higher elevation.


Point L 

Land mines begin to appear again, some in very close proximity to one another. Slow your speed down until you get the rhythm of the jumps. 


Point M 

More land mines appear. In this section, some land mine pairs are so close that it's actually possible to hurdle the combination at top speed, but this requires great familiarity with the mine sequence before attempting. 


Point N 

5 tri-orbs appear, for a unique chance at a 1000 point bonus for clearing them all. 4 regular crafts appear as well. 


P - T


Point O 

As soon as you begin your descent down the hill, five elliptical crafts swarm overhead with four regular crafts. Once you reach the bottom of the hill, a tricky combination of rocks and craters occurs, so clear the crafts as quickly as possible. 


Point P 

The craters continue to come at a relatively easy pace. A rocket car will appear while you continue to jump craters. The land will level out and eventually the rocket car will launch itself at you. Jump to avoid it, and shoot it as you land, but be ready to jump the next crater which comes up almost immediately. 


Point Q 

Rocks occur on either side of some craters now, some grouped in pairs. The very end of the section contains closely arranged land mines. 


Point R 

More rocks and craters show up, with the space plants occupying the later batch. 


Point S 

5 tri-orbs are accompanied by 3 elliptical crafts. A few rocks show up towards the end. 


U - Z


T 

As the section starts out, a few rocks and craters get in your way before a rocket car appears. This time, it will launch shortly after you land from a jump over a crater, so be ready to jump back up again as the car approaches. 


U 

A number of land mines appear. In the middle, two rocks must be destroyed. Use this as a cue to speed up quite a bit, because a pair of land mines roughly one buggy's width apart must be leaped over simultaneously and you need a good bit of speed. 


V 

A total of 5 tri-orb crafts and 5 regular crafts will appear to launch an attack over you. Continue to monitor forward for craters created by tri-orbs' grenades. 


W 

A rapid succession of craters, rocks, and space plants occur here. It is best to travel at normal or slower speed to ensure that you have time to destroy every obstacle in your way. 


X 

5 tri-orbs and four regular craft will dominate the sky above you. 


Y 

A full combination of tanks, craters, rocks, and space plants will assail you during the very final section of the champion course. 




* Hint 1 : When alien ships fly over, keep adjusting your speed or they will eventually hit you with a bomb. Draw their bombs to one end of the screen, then shift to the other. 


* Hint 2 : Although the part of the mines seems to be the more difficult, it isn't - all you have to do is not move your tank at all, only pressing the jump button. You won't get many bonus points, but at least you'll survive. 


* Hint 3 : The big key to this game is memorization. After the beginner course, you go on to the champion course, which never changes no matter how many times you pass it. Memorize the two courses, and you will almost never lose a life.

Mortal Kombat (c) 1992 Midway.


A 1-on-1 fighting game featuring a cast of 7 different fighters. Mortal Kombat took ideas from Capcom's seminal "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", such as the game's special moves and projectiles. It also introduced a cast of photo-realistic digitized fighters for players to fight either as or against.


Battles are fought over the best of 3 rounds. At the end of a round a voice instructs the winner to 'finish him' and players have only a couple of seconds to try and execute their character's 'fatality', which sees the winner killing the loser in a spectacular and grisly fashion.

- TRIVIA -


Released in July 1992.


Mortal Kombat was renowned as the first fighting game to use digitized characters and blood (as opposed to the hand-animated, more cartoon-like graphics of competing games). Mortal Kombat was developed as a reaction to the popular Capcom game "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", with simpler controls and digitized graphics. Some say the game's graphic violence was gratuitous, and was only included in order to generate a public outcry and controversy that would increase publicity for the game.


Although highly controversial, the mix of realism and violence propelled Mortal Kombat to the height of popularity. An example of the game's innovations was the Fatality, a special finishing move executed against a dying opponent to create an even more gruesome death. For example, one character would grasp a defeated, wobbling opponent by the head, then rip the head and spine out of the opponent's body, which then crumpled to the ground in a pool of blood. Another aspect of game-play that became a recurring element in games that followed was the so-called 'juggle', where a series of moves could be executed against an opponent who was kept in mid-air by the force of the attacks, and who hence had no defense against further attacks as long as the 'juggle' could be maintained.


The original concept of Mortal Kombat was modeled after the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie 'Bloodsport', which is a cult classic martial arts film. The character of Johnny Cage is directly modeled after Frank Dux, Van Damme's character in the movie. Johnny Cage's film-star motif is an obvious link to this. Cage also wears the same costume (plus shoes) that Van Damme's character wore in the final battle of the movie. Cage's splits punch was originally seen in Bloodsport during the fight against the Sumo wrestler. Since Midway was unable to get Van Damme for this game, they kept the same kumite/martial arts movie concept and added the Kombat story.


Mortal Kombat was the first video game to have an official release date countdown in U.S./U.K. and Australia. This momentous day was known as 'Mortal Monday'.


The code for this game includes the ASCII string 'NOOBSAIBOT' (originally in "Mortal Kombat II" rev. 3.1), suggesting that the character may have made his first appearance here, instead of Reptile (which took up less memory).


The heads used in the background of the first stage and in the spike pit are actually those of the programmers themselves! The statue of Buddha in the background of the courtyard stage was actually a lawn ornament from a neighbor's yard.


During the fighting scenes that take place on the stone platform above the field of sharp spikes, if you look closely at the glowing moon in the background, you will sometimes see a silhouette fly past it. These shadows will either be Peter Pan and the Darling children, a witch on a broomstick, a kite, a blimp, a rocket, a flying saucer, or Santa Claus in his reindeer-pulled sleigh. The shadows appear about every 6 games.


Liu Kang is Midway's homage to Bruce Lee.


Raiden really is the Japanese God of Thunder. His appearance in myth is quite different though : he has red skin and a demonic face, his feet have two claws on them, and he carries either a wheel or drums on his back. He also is thought to eat human navels so people are advised to lie on their stomachs during storms.


In the Courtyard stage, above the red door on the right side, you can see "Pac-Man", a ghost and a power pellet carved on the stone.


A Mortal Kombat unit appears in the 1995 movie 'The Doom Generation'.


A bootleg version of Mortal Kombat exists, where the name of the manufacturer is YAWDIM - that's MIDWAY reversed!


A hacked version also exist, every stage had a black/night sky and every time you got frozen by Sub-Zero, your fighter would rise up and stay there 'till you either got hit or the freezing effect went away. The same thing would happen if you were using Sub-Zero and froze your opponent. The machine would boot up just like a regular MK machine boots up, except another black screen with red letters and asterisks labeling it as "Mortal Kombat Black Ninja Edition" was displayed before the title screen.


Midway released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Mortal Kombat II: Music from the Arcade Game Soundtrack - 123770-C1) on 01/12/1993.

- TRIVIA -


This is the first Mortal Kombat game to have bi-level battlefields, which lets players uppercut their opponent to the level above them when fighting on certain levels.


This is the first Mortal Kombat arcade game that did not include Scorpion, and, according to series co-creator Ed Boon, the last. It's also the first game in the series to feature the 'Run' button and the controversial command combo system.


The story of Stryker : Originally, the character Kurtis Stryker was supposed to appear in MK1, but was scrapped early in the development process when beta tests revealed a player interest in a female character in the game, which led to Sonya replacing Stryker. In MK2, Kurtis Stryker almost made it to the final game, but finally had his name changed to... Jax. For MK3, a new Kurtis Stryker is created and is finally made part of a MK game.


'Sektor' and 'Cyrax' before given their names were called 'ketchup' and 'mustard'.


The head that occasionally appears after an uppercut or combo and says 'Toasty' is the digitized head of Dan Forden who worked on the sound and music for the game.


Midway / Toasty Productions released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Musik: MK3 & MK4 Arcade Video Game Soundtrack) on 01/01/1997.

- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1993. This game was the first Midway release to use the DCS Sound System.


'Noob Saibot' backwards spells 'Boon' and 'Tobias' who are the names of the principal game designers.


'Jax' was originally supposed to be in the original "Mortal Kombat" game and named Kurtis Stryker. Jax was then moved to MKII and the Stryker character debuted in "Mortal Kombat 3".


'Kintaro' was originally intended to be a humanoid tiger, similar to the creature in Japanese mythology. This idea was scrapped, however, due to the fact that creating the costume would not have been feasable. However, thanks to this original idea, the Shokan we know as Kintaro has the tiger stripes on his back.


Real life : Philip Ahn, who played the regenerated Shang Tsung, is in fact a doctor.


Three of the cast members for MK2 filed a lawsuit against Midway shortly after the game was released. The claim? The physical instructors/martial artists Elizabeth Malecki (Sonya Blade), Catalin Zamiar (Kitana/Milenna) and Philip Ahn were under the impression that they were hired under typical acting contracts and were entitled to a small modicum of benefits including royalties of title sales, etc. The plaintiffs banded together against Midway, who took the case to court. Eventually the judge failed on Midway's behalf, citing that the work done by the plaintiffs for Midway was done strictly as a 'work-for-hire' and Midway owned all the property and benefits on the characters/titles/etc. As a consequence, all three left the project, and were recast for "Mortal Kombat 3".


SFII / MK2 : both games were supposed to be released within weeks of each other (at this time, "Street Fighter" and "Mortal Kombat" were the dominant fighting games). Capcom released "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" early so that they could attract fans away from MK. At the same time, Midway released MK2 early for similar reasons. As you can see, the result meant that both came back to square one.


'Friendships' and 'Babalities' (see 'Tips And Tricks' section for more info) in MKII were used in making light of the violence controversy in the first "Mortal Kombat" game.


Two non-existent hidden characters were 'Torch', and 'Hornbuckle'. In MKII there is a location called 'The Pit II'. Far in the background of this stage there is another bridge across the chasm. Standing stationary on this bridge are two fighters : one of them is a Liu Kang sprite with green pants who was named Hornbuckle by fans. One of Jade's hints was 'Hornbuckle who?', which people thought was the name of a hidden fighter, and was apparently given to the guy opposite 'Torch' on The Pit II. If you watch the ending credits, one of the programmers' last names is Hornbuckle. The other fighter is a humanoid character that seems to be made of fire. As these two characters never move, it has been suggested that the 'other fighter' is actually a funeral pyre. Finally, there is a cloaked figure who floats in front of the window during fights in The Tower and Portal stages in MKII. This character was dubbed Cloak by fans, and was assumed to be a hidden character. The character of Torch, who had been very popular with fans, eventually showed up as a playable character in "Mortal Kombat : Deadly Alliance". Unfortunately, due to trademark issues, he had to be called Blaze instead of Torch. The true identity of Cloak was revealed in "Mortal Kombat : Shaolin Monks" to be one of Shang Tsung's servants, a shadow priest.


The head that occasionally appears after an uppercut and says 'Toasty' is the digitized head of Dan Forden who worked on the sound and music for the game.


Jimmy Cardenas holds the official record for this game with 282,000 points.


Midway released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Mortal Kombat II: Music from the Arcade Game Soundtrack - 123770-C1) on 01/12/1993.

Motos (c) 09/1985 Namco.


The object of the game is to bump your enemies - space bugs - off the solar base using Motos, your ship. When you bump all of them off, you move to the next base or round. If Motos is knocked off the base, you lose one life. The game is over when you lose all your lives.


You can collect power parts or jump parts lying on the solar base by simply having Motos touch them. The collected parts will be displayed in the lower left corner of the screen and you can use them in the next round. Motos can be outfitted with no more than 7 power parts; the more power parts added, the more powerful Motos is. However, Motos can only be outfitted with only 1 jump part per round. With a jump part, Motos can jump over two squares by moving the joystick in the desired direction and pressing the Jump button. One jump on a square cracks the square and a second jump in the same spot makes a hole in the solar base.


You can outfit Motos with these parts in the Power Parts or Jump Parts screen displayed at the beginning of each round. Select the number of parts you want by moving left and right with the joystick, and lock them in place by pressing the Jump button. You can use the selected parts for one round only; they will not be available in subsequent rounds.


Linger too long on the playing field and Shooting Stars will begin to fall periodically onto the solar base. The Stars are aimed at Motos, and when they miss they crack a square or break a hole in the solar base (like they do to the base behind the Motos logo in the attract mode's title sequence).

Mr. Do! (c) 1983 Universal.


Mr. Do! is a colourful and addictive maze game in which the player takes on the role of the eponymous Mr. Do, a circus clown who must clear each level of either cherries or monsters. The game's single screen levels are made up of tunnels surrounded by a colourful, soil-like substance. This soil can be dug through to create new tunnels, allowing Mr. Do to escape his enemies and to reach the many cherries that litter the levels. A number of apples are also scattered around each level, and Mr. Do can push them along tunnels (to block and/or kill monsters) or can tunnel beneath them to drop them onto the heads of any pursuing enemies. Mr. Do himself can also be killed by a falling apple.


Mr. Do is armed with a 'Powerball' that can be fired down a tunnel, it will then bounce around the tunnels until it either returns to Mr. Do, or comes into contact with, and kills, one of the level's monsters. The Powerball will only return once Mr. Do has tunneled under more soil. As each level progresses, the monsters themselves start to dig tunnels of their own in their pursuit of Mr. Do. Monsters can also push the apples.


Each screen has a doorway through which the monsters enter the level. Once all of the monsters have appeared, the doorway will turn into a 'prize', (ice cream, biscuits, etc.). If the player collects the prize, the 'Alphamonster' and his four henchmen will appear. The Alphamonster may be in the EXTRA box at the top of the screen or be moving around the screen. The Alphamonster and his henchmen cannot be easily crushed under apples because they tend to eat them. They can be killed individually with the Powerball or by killing the Alphamonster itself, at which point any remaining henchmen will turn into apples.


After every three levels, there is a brief intermission in which a tune is played and a large, animated Mr. Do appears, together with some of the game's monsters. The time to complete each level and the preferred method (monsters, cherries, EXTRA or Diamond) is shown. The paths in the first level resemble a 'D', after this each level's tunnels resemble a digit, ('2', '3', '4' etc.) up to '0' for level 10.


A level can be completed any one of several different ways : either by collecting all of the on-screen cherries; by killing all of the monsters, by completing the EXTRA box, or by collecting the diamond. The latter appears only very occasionally ('Special' awards an extra credit).

- TRIVIA -


Mr Do! was also licensed to Taito.


Inspired by "Dig Dug". The first in a series of four Mr. Do! games, Mr Do! was one of video-gaming's biggest arcade successes. Unfortunately for Universal, none of their other games could match it in commercial terms and the company disappeared in the video game crash of 1983-84.


Mr. Do is the game responsible for launching the kit game craze in the U.S. video game industry.


David Breckon holds the official record for this game with 26,030,050 points.


A bootleg of this game is known as "Mr. Lo!" and another is called "Mr. Du!".


There are several well-known hacks of Mr Do! which are as follows :

* Mr. DigDo! - graphics changed to make them look more like those of Namco's "Dig Dug".

* Mr. Jong - Changes the clown into an old Chinese man, the monsters into clowns and the apples into mahjong blocks.

* Yankee Do! - Changes the graphics to make them more American patriotic.


- UPDATES -


On the Prototype version (which is a Japanese hack) :

* You are a 'Yukidaruma' (a snowman) with green arms instead of the famous clown.

* You dig with a rake in your hands.

* There is a mean expression when you push an apple.

* The screen does not change colour when you grab cookies, cake, etc...


- SCORING -


Eating a cherry : 50 points.

Eating a series of 8 cherries in a row : 500 points bonus.

Killing a monster with your snowball : 500 points.

Killing one monster with one apple : 1,000 points.

Killing two monsters with one apple : 2,000 points.

Killing three monsters with one apple : 4,000 points.

Killing four monsters with one apple : 6,000 points.

Killing five or more monsters with one apple : 8,000 points.

Collecting special (free credit) diamond : 8,000 points.

Collecting bonus treat from empty monster home : 500 points on level one, increasing by 500 points per level up to a maximum of 8,000 points on level 15 onwards.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* 255 Lives Tricks : It's possible to win 255 lives on the first screen, but only if an apple appears in the top two rows of the playfield.

1) Begin by digging a tunnel directly from the bottom of the screen to just below the apple, but leave enough dirt under it that it doesn't fall.

2) Next, kill all of the enemies but one, then lose all of your extra lives. As soon as you're on your last life, go right under the apple and wait.

3) Eventually, the remaining enemy will come after you. Allow the apple to drop, but, in the interval before you're squashed, kill the enemy with the powerball. If all has gone well, you'll be carried to the bottom of the screen, the music will go haywire for a moment, and you'll be awarded 255 extra lives.

4) Note that you should always lose a life before spelling 'EXTRA', or you'll roll back to zero lives, so, to be safe, immediately kill yourself at the start of level two.

5) IMPORTANT : This trick will only work with the Taito version of Mr. Do!.


* Here's A Neat Trick : You can divide the screen into a grid. The cheries, apples, and tunnel corners are all centered on a grid element. If you are being chased by the normal badguys (not ghosts) you can dig and stop between grid elements. The badguy will think it needs to turn into a digger to get you. While he's changing forms, you can escape.


* An alphamonster will appear after every 5,000 points.

Mr. Do's Castle (c) 1983 Universal.


For the second game in the Mr. Do. series, the clown finds himself in a traditional platforms and ladders game. Each level is made up of 6 floors (7 including the castle's ramparts) and all are joined by a number of inter-connecting ladders. The ladders come if 2 different types : vertical ladders, which are fixed and cannot be moved; and diagonal ladders, which can be pushed left or right from the top of the ladder. This allows Mr. Do. to reach other areas of the level and is sometimes necessary to redirect the path of any pursuing enemies.


The enemies in "Mr Do's Castle" come in the form of unicorns; and as with the enemies of the first game, they will hunt down and try to kill Mr. Do. Replacing the 'Powerball' weapon of the original game, Mr Do is now armed with a mallet. This can be used to temporarily stun the game's unicorns and by the player time to escape; but its primary function is to knock out the floor stones that form each level's platforms.


Some stones are marked with a cherry and collecting all of these will complete the level. A level can also be completed by killing all of the unicorns. This is achieved by using the mallet to remove blocks and knock holes in the platforms. The unicorns will fall into any holes that the player has created, remaining trapped into them for a few seconds. Trapped unicorns can be hit with Mr. Do's mallet and knocked to a lower platform, but not killed - useful for guying a few extra seconds for the player. If left alone, however, they will climb out, filling the hole in behind them. The knocked unicorns change color (first green, then blue), becoming nastier. Blue unicorns cannot be stunned with the mallet : you've to kill them!


Some sections of a platform have 2 'skull' stones on them, with normal stones in between. When both skull blocks are knocked out with the mallet, all the blocks in between will fall to reveal wooden floorboards. This is highly effective in killing several enemies at once.


Each level also has 3 'Key' blocks. If Mr.Do. knocks out all of the key blocks, a large pair of doors opens at the top of the screen. Behind them is a shield which, when collected, turns the unicorns into 'Alphamonsters' for a limited time (more or less like Pac-Man ghosts). The Alphamonsters flee from Mr. Do! and can be killed either with the mallet, or by dropping a floor stone onto them from the level above. When Mr. Do! kills an Alphamonster, its letter appears on a flagpole at the top of the screen. If the players collects all five letters, an extra life is awarded.

* Extended game play by the inclusion of blocks with cherries embedded in them.

* The replay Diamond was added.


- SCORING -


Knocking a block onto a red unicorn below so it falls one level : 500 points.

Knocking a block onto a red unicorn below so it falls two levels : 1,000 points.

Knocking a block onto a red unicorn below so it falls three levels : 1,500 points.

Knocking a block onto a red unicorn below so it falls four levels : 2,000 points.

Killing a green unicorn : x2 points.

Killing a blue unicorn : x3 points.

Killing 2, 3 or 4 unicorns with one block : x2, x4, x6 points.

Collecting the free credit diamond : 8,000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Make use of the rows of blocks marked with a skull block at each end. Knock out one skull block and all of the middle blocks, wait for unicorns to fall into the gaps and knock out the other skull block. This will cause the whole row of blocks to fall, killing all unicorns in the holes and below.


* Use your hammer to briefly stun a pursuing unicorn, allowing you to escape.


* If a unicorn is chasing you up a diagonal ladder, push the top of the ladder away when you reach the top so the unicorn ends up on a different platform.


* Blue unicorns are quite dangerous, and after a certain amount of time they duplicate themselves, so kill them as fast as you can if you don't wanna be outnumbered!


* You can kill a unicorn on the same level as you if he is standing on a block when you hit it. The unicorn will fall and you will be awarded the same score as if you had knocked the block down onto the unicorn.


* If a unicorn is filling a hole vacated by a block, you can hemmer it to knock the unicorn down to the next level. Note you CANNOT do this to a blue unicorn.


* Wait until all unicorns are as close as possible before collecting the cross to turn them into EXTRA letters, giving you more chance to kill more of them.


* You can fall from any height and will not die so jump down through gaps to avoid unicorns.

Mr. Do's Wild Ride (c) 1984 Universal.


Mr Do's third arcade outing is another platform game, following on from the superb "Mr. Do's Castle", released a year earlier. The synonymous Mr. Do! cherries are present and correct, but are not used in the same way as in other games in the series. In both "Mr Do!" and "Mr. Do's Castle", collecting all of the cherries available was a way of completing a level. In Wild Ride, however, collecting them merely changes the 'prize' awarded upon reaching the level's goal. This can be one or two letters from EXTRA, or other items which simply award bonus points. When Mr. Do reaches his goal, he waves a flag while the bonus counter is added to his score.


The gameplay is similar to that of Nintendo's legendary "Donkey Kong", with Mr. Do starting each level at the bottom of the screen, trying to make his way to the exit at the very top. Mr. Do doesn't have either his Powerball or mallet in this game, but holding the ACTION button makes him run faster along the track. The trade-off of this is that his bonus points deplete much quicker. When all of the EXTRA letters are collected, the player is awarded with an extra life.


Each of the game's six levels is set on a roller coaster, with each having its own theme, traps and pitfalls. Wild Ride doesn't feature the intermission screens that appear in previous Mr.Do games.


The levels are :

Level 1, Roller Coaster. 

Level 2, Pirate Ship. 

Level 3, Three Elevators. 

Level 4, Castle on Screen. 

Level 5, Multiple Columns. 

Level 6, Six Rings.


After level six the levels are repeated.

Released in January 1984.


The title 'Mr. Do's Wild Ride' may be an homage to 'Mr. Toad's Wild Ride', an attraction at Disneyland.


Ocean Software, who were based in the city of Manchester, England, released a home computer version of the game. They obviously decided, however, that the "Mr.Do!" name was no longer commercially strong enough to guarantee strong sales, and instead re-tooled the game as 'Kong Strikes Back' - dropping Nintendo's ubiquitous giant ape into the game and arming the player with bombs - which act in the same way as Mr.Do's powerball.


A Mr. Do's Wild Ride machine was shown at the 2003 classic arcade games show 'California Extreme' in San Jose, California.

Released in May 1986.


Goemon is based on Ishikawa Goemon, an infamous outlaw in 16th century Japan. Some stories tell of Goemon becoming a criminal after stealing from his cruel master and killing his pursuers. Later he becomes a merchant in Kyoto and Osaka by day and a thief by night. Whilst some remember him as simply a thief, others celebrate him as being a Japanese Robin Hood, robbing from the rich to give to the poor.


- SCORING -


Collecting a weapon : 100 points.

Killing a warrior : 200 points.

Killing a second warrior : 400 points.

Killing a third warrior : 800 points.

Warriors when powered up : 800 points each.

Killing a flying boss : 1,600 points.

Collecting a gold bar at the end of a level : 800-4,000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Attack the moon by Kiseru (Button 1). If your attack hits, the rabbit will fall down.


* Warriors can only fire at you when on a platform, so bouncing them up into the air is useful to prevent them firing.


* When you collect a golden hammer keep running right, and warriors will keep appearing and running into you for 800 points each.


* If you are faced with several warriors, bounce a few off the bottom of the screen to get them out of your way.


* Try not to use the last 'head weapon' you collect, as you can carry it forward to the next stage. It's very useful to start a stage already armed.


o I think when collecting the gold bars if you jump to try to get the furthest to the right, it is worth a higher score.

* If you are heading towards a dead end, stop on a corner, and wait for the fuses to burn themselves out - better than losing a life!


* On the early levels clear as much of the maze as possible for extra points.


* If you manage to cut the fuses off completely from you, feel free to leech points by clearing as much of the maze as you can.


* Use the blocks inside the grid to keep the fuses at bay. You can force them to take a particular route by clearing the grid and leaving them no option.

Ms. Pac-Man (c) 1981 Midway.


In this, the first proper sequel to Namco's legendary pill eating maze game, players must once again run around a number of mazes, eating all of the pills that are scattered throughout. The ever-present ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Sue) return to hamper the player's progress. The infamous 'Power Pills' are also present and correct, with four appearing in each maze.


Namco introduced a number of changes and enhancements over the original game. The first difference is in the main character. For the first time in video-game history, the game's lead character was female. Ms. Pac-Man is almost identical to the original character with two main differences; she wears a bow in her 'hair', and is also wearing lipstick.


Another change from the original is that the bonus fruit items are no longer static but now move randomly around the mazes.


Ms Pac-Man features 4 different maze layouts, which alternate every 2 to 4 screens :


The 1st maze is only encountered in Rounds 1 and 2, and has 220 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are 2 sets of tunnels in this maze equidistant from the center of the maze. You must clear this maze 2 times before moving on to the next maze.


The 2nd maze is only encountered in Rounds 3, 4, and 5, and has 240 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are 2 sets of tunnels in this maze; one set in the lower half, and the other set at the very top. You must clear this maze 3 times before moving on to the next maze.


The 3rd maze is first encountered in Round 6 and has 238 dots and 4 Power Pills. Unlike all other mazes, there is only 1 set of tunnels in this maze, slightly above the center of the board. You must clear this maze 4 times before moving on to the next maze.


The 4rth and final unique maze is first encountered in Round 10 and has 234 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are 2 sets of tunnels in this maze, directly next to one another in the middle of the maze. The turns at the entrance to the tunnels change the usual immediate accessibility of the tunnels and should be taken in to account. You must clear this maze 4 times before moving on to the next maze.


After Round 13, the game alternates every 4 rounds between the third and fourth mazes.


Finally, the ghosts' movement patterns are also completely different to those of the original game.


As in the original game, intermission scenes will be played after certain rounds. Ms. Pac-Man's intermissions tell the story of how Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man met, fell in love, and had a baby. Ms. Pac-Man's intermissions are also preceded by a sign and a title. 3 intermissions are present : 

Act I - They Meet : Pac-Man, the star of the original game, enters the screen being chased by Inky. Ms. Pac-Man enters from the other side being chased by Pinky. As the 2 of them are about to collide, they quickly move upwards, causing Inky and Pinky to collide. Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man face each other at the top of the screen, and a heart appears above them. This intermission is played after Round 2.

Act II - The Chase : Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man are seen giving each other a playful chase. One chases the other in one direction, and they take turns alternating who chases who and in what direction. After three turns, they chase each other twice more at a faster speed. This intermission is played after Round 5.

Act III - Junior : Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man anxiously await the arrival of a stork, who flies overhead with a bundle. As the stork is about to pass over them, he releases the bundle, which drops to the ground in front of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, and opens up to reveal a baby Pac. This intermission, which is played after Rounds 9, 13, and 17, would later serve as the introductory sequence to "Jr. Pac-Man".


No intermission is present between rounds after the 18th one.


- TECHNICAL -


Ms. Pac-Man was available in 3 distinct cabinets (not including bootleg versions) :

* The upright version came in the standard Namco/Midway cabinet. This is the same 'swoopy' cabinet that "Galaxian", "Galaga", and "Pac-Man" came in as well. These featured painted side-art of Ms. Pac-Man and the ghosts, along with some pink accent lines. The last 10,000 or so Ms. Pac-Man machines to roll off the assembly line had sticker side-art instead, it was the same basic scene, but the colors were brighter, and there were a few minor differences in the layout of the graphics. The marquee showed an image of Ms. Pac-Man lounging on her own logo, with a ghost off to the side. The exact colors used on the marquee varied a bit over the production run (as did the paint codes used on the side). The control panel and monitor bezel had a single design that covered both of them, that of a blue background with a pink or maroon stripe going around it, with a few game instructions printed upon them.

* The mini version came in a smaller woodgrain cabinet, without any side-art. All of its graphics were scaled down versions of the ones used on the upright, except for a graphic of Ms. Pac-Man chasing three ghosts that appeared on the lower part of the control panel.

* The cocktail version came in the standard Namco/Midway woodgrain cocktail table. It was minimally adorned with a logo underneath the top glass, and instructions on the control panels.


All versions used the same internal hardware which consisted of a "Pac-Man" linear power supply, Electrohome open frame monitor, and a "Pac-Man" main-board with the Ms. Pac-Man daughter-card installed. All versions also used the same 4-Way leaf switch joystick, which had a very short throw.

- TRIVIA -


Having won their enhancement kit lawsuit against Atari, General Computing went to Bally Midway and showed them an enhancement kit that they were working on for Pac-Man called Crazy Otto. Crazy Otto was a character similar to Pac-Man with the exception that he had legs. GCC was going to bluff Midway into letting them release their enhancement kit by telling them that they won their lawsuit against Atari, and that they just wanted Midway's blessing. Midway suggested that they create a sequel to the original "Pac-Man" instead of an enhancement kit, and GCC got to work on Ms. Pac-Man. Ms. Pac-Man had two prior names before settling on the one that everyone knows. 'Mrs. Pac-Man' was the original, but some of the women employees at Midway had a problem with that, so it was changed to 'Miss Pac-Man'. When someone pointed out the third intermission, where Pac and Ms. Pac welcome "Jr. Pac-Man" (or Baby Pac-Man) into the fold, they changed it to the final name of 'Ms. Pac-Man'. Midway released "Baby Pac-Man" as a pinball/video hybrid, and General Computing sued the company, claiming they had created the concept of a Pac Family. They won the suit and were awarded royalties from Pac Family merchandise.


In its initial run 110,000 units were produced in the U.S. making it the best selling domestic arcade video game of all time.


The game added a few improvements over the original :

* Non-deterministic artificial intelligence for the ghosts, making it harder for enthusiasts to follow set patterns through levels.

* A variety of different mazes used through the game.

* Bonus items (such as cherries and pretzels) entered the maze and bounced through it, rather than appear in a set location as in the original, making the player go out of his way to attain it.

* Brand new sound effects, including a new 'death' sound and opening theme.


It was also one of the more successful of early arcade games in the female demographic, which has been attributed to 'Ms. Pac-Man' being a girl - although the Ms. Pac-Man sprite was little more than "Pac-Man" with eyelashes, a bow, lipstick and a dimple.


After the 255th level, the maze (including dots) disappears. The game becomes unplayable, since there are no more dots to eat.


Chris Ayra holds the record for this game on 'Regular' settings with 920,310 points on August 16, 1998.

Victor Kunisada holds the record for this game on 'Speed-Up' settings with 922,810 points on June 16, 2001.

A Ms. Pac-Man unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Tightrope' (the cab appears in the background of the bar scene), in the 1990 movie 'The Grifters' , in the 1999 movie 'Man In The Moon' and in the 2002 movie 'Van Wilder'.


Milton Bradley (MB) released a board game based on this video game in 1983. Up to 4 players can play. The maze is divided into four colored areas, representing each player; the object of the game is to clear all the dots in your colored area. Only one player at a time controls Ms. Pac-Man; the other players control the ghosts. Once a ghost catches Ms. Pac-Man, the player controlling that ghost takes over control of Ms. Pac-Man.


Some hacks are known as "Ms. Pac-Man Plus", "Ms. Pac Attack", "Ms. Pac-Man Champion Edition" and "Pac-Gal".


- SCORING -


Dot : 10 points

Power pill (energizer) : 50 points

Ghosts : 200, 400, 800, 1600 points

Cherry : 100 points

Strawberry : 200 points

Peach : 500 points

Pretzel : 700 points

Apple : 1000 points

Pear : 2000 points

Banana : 5000 points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* The most dangerous section of the first maze is the long path at the very top. It is safest to clear it when the ghosts are blue, or at least 3 of them occupy the bottom half of the maze. 


* There are a couple of dangerous sections in the second maze. The pathways above and below the T section at the top of the maze can be particularly easy to get trapped in. It is easiest to clear these when all 4 ghosts are close on your tail, or after eating one of the top two power pellets. The 2 sections directly above the lower escape tunnels on either side should also be cleared with caution. 


* The most dangerous section of the 3rd maze is the center of the bottom, directly below where you begin. It is advisable to clear it out as early as possible before the ghosts can organize and trap you. The top section of the maze presents the ghosts with many pathways to reach you, so use caution. 


* The most dangerous sections of the 4th maze is the section that you begin in, and the section directly above the ghosts' den. The very top section of the maze should also be cleared with caution. 


* Secret Message : the message 'GENERAL COMPUTER CORPORATION Hello, Nakamura!' is buried at the end of the Ms. Pac-Man ROM image (Masaya Nakamura was head of Namco).


* There's a fairly well-known glitch in the game - if you put a coin in when the Ms. Pac-Man marquee title first appears but before Blinky appears then the first board will be blue instead of pink and will remain blue until you either finish the board or lose a life, after which the board will return to its normal color.

Munch Mobile (c) 1983 SNK.


A weird driving game with a car that has long arms that reach out to grab a variety of edible items that appear along roadside.


The object is to drive safely down the road. Pick up enough fuel to stay alive while avoiding other vehicles that go by, grab as many bonus objects as possible including apples, cherries, bananas, acorns, live fish and money, and park your car in the garage. Driving while trying to pick up the goodies is difficult and you can crash very easily on the narrow roads. The pace of the game is frustrating because the hands move slowly while the car itself moves really fast, especially in the later rounds. If one of your hands hits a tree or any other foreign object in its quest for food, the car winces in pain for a few moments until it can use its hands again.


You can get a bonus for putting used-up food into garbage cans. Grabbing fish which leap out of surrounding rivers is a safe bet, but most other bonuses are placed, so you can crash if you try to grab them. The best strategy is only to go for the fuel, since the car is a big gas guzzler and you can also get a bonus for leftover fuel at the end of the drive.

Muscle Bomber - The Body Explosion (c) 1993 Capcom.


Choose from 10 different wrestlers in this 4-player wrestling/fighting game. Each wrestler has an assortment of moves, including his own special super slam. The object of the game is to win and defend the championship by pinning or putting a submission hold on your opponent. There are 2 different games to select and play : Single Match or Tag Team 'Battle Royal'.


In Single Match, you can choose to be one of eight wrestlers including Mike Hagger, Alexander The Grater, El Stingray, King Rasta Mon, Titanic Tim, Gunloc, Biff Bolshevik and The Great Oni (NOTE : Jumbo Jack and The Scorpion cannot be selected in this game).


After you have selected a wrestler, you will compete in a world-wide tournament against the other nine wrestlers (including Jumbo Jack and The Scorpion) in respective matches. In each match, you must defeat each of your respective opponents by a pinfall, countout or submission in order to proceed to each of the following matches. If you beat all the opponents, you will become the champion and then you will have to face all opponents again to defend your title.


In Tag Team 'Battle Royal', you get to choose any two of the ten wrestlers for your tag team including Jumbo Jack and The Scorpion. Here you and your partner have to eliminate both of the two wrestlers on the opposing tag team in order to win the match and proceed to the next. During these matches, if you are eliminated before your partner is, the match will be declared no contest and it will be a draw.


During each bout in this game, metal buckets and/or glass bottles will sometimes be thrown into the ring which can be picked by your wrestler(s) and used as weapons against your opponents.

NAM-1975 (c) 1990 SNK.


One or two players take control of 2 machine-gun carrying Vietnam vets who must shoot their way through a number of sideways scrolling, Vietnam-themed levels. the players shoot INTO the screen and aiming is achieved via the use an on-screen target, which each player directs to lock on to the various enemy troops and vehicles. Players can run and somersault to avoid the incoming enemy fire.


A number of more powerful weapons - such as grenades and flame throwers - are often dropped by the enemy and can be picked up and used. Bonus points are also revealed in this fashion.


Nam-1975 is a blatant plagurisation of TAD Corp's "Cabal", released in 1988. Cabal is easily the more accomplished of the two games.

Released in February 1993. Many critics claim that the release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games, which were based around action-packed, unrealistic game-play.


Midway Games, no stranger to releasing landmark games having released "Pac-Man", had started experimenting with the ideas two years earlier, with the "High Impact Football" series. Both High Impact and Super High Impact had somewhat average success in arcades. It was not until the release of NBA Jam that gamers noticed the new genre. The game became exceptionally popular, and generated a lot of money for arcades after its release, largely because of the fairly expensive prices put on these games; a game quarter generally took two credits and a full game generally took eight, typically equal to $2.00 USD. Nonetheless, the game was a smash hit.


NBA Jam was one of the first real playable basketball arcade games (It was the first game to be officially licensed by the NBA (National Basketball Association)), and was also one of the first sports games to feature real teams, real players, and their real digitized likenesses. However, the unrealism of the game was the major drawing point, as the high flying dunks (often featuring players jumping twice their own height in the air while making highly acrobatic slams) were the games' signature. Of course, seeing NBA superstars like Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone, David Robinson, Charles Barkley, and Shaquille O'Neal flying through the air with the greatest of ease brought just as many fans back. In time, players discovered another major feature of the game, as it was filled with easter eggs, special features and players activated by initials or button/joystick combinations.

Name That Tune (c) 04/1986 Bally Sente.


The game itself was an almost exact translation of the 1980s incarnation of the gameshow. It was all colors and text, and the only animation in it was a little hand that played notes on a piano. The interface had to be simple, as they used up all the ROM space on the different songs.

- TRIVIA -


This game came out when arcades were at a very low point. But someone over at Sente gets the bright idea that a big honking upright 'Name that Tune' machine would make lots of money. So they proceeded to pay big money to license the show, and then they went ahead and started pumping out 'Name that Tune' arcade games. It was a big flop. They were targeting the wrong audience with this game. Teenagers simply weren't interested in trying to name old 40s and 50s songs. This game could have done fine if it was in a bartop unit instead.


This title was available only as a conversion kit for machines with the Sente SAC-I hardware installed. This meant that most of them ended up in the futuristic looking all-metal SAC-I cabinets.


There were supposed to be several different upgrade chips available for this game, but they seem to have fallen off the face of the earth.

NARC (c) 1988 Williams.


A graphically violent 1 or 2-player side-scrolling shoot-em-up in which players take on the role of "NARCS"; futuristic police officers whose duty it is to either arrest of kill drug dealers, junkies and attack dogs. The NARCS have machine guns and rocket launchers at their disposal, and players can also pick up discarded drugs and money to earn extra points. These are totaled up at the end of each level. In addition, a special colour-specific 'Keycard' must often be found before players can progress to the next section of the level.

- TRIVIA -


Released in December 1988, NARC was the first arcade game to use a 32-bit processor (TMS34010).


Max Force (Player One) was a part of Acclaim's (who made the NES version of NARC) 'Power Team' along with Tyrone ("Arch Rivals"), Kuros (Wizards and Warriors/Ironsword), Bigfoot (the monster truck) and Kwirk the tomato, in an animated series featuring the characters. Three of the NARC bosses : Mr. Big, Dr. Spike Rush and Joe Rockhead were the villains on the series.


Grunge band the Pixies released a cover of the tune from level 2-1 of this game in 1991 as 'Theme From Narc', as a B-side to the single 'Planet Of Sound'. It can also be found on the later 'Pixies Complete B-Sides' album.


A NARC unit appears in the 1990 movie 'Don't Tell Her It's Me', in the 1990 movie 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' and in the 1991 movie 'Terminator 2 - Judgment Day'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* While coming out of any door, move the joystick Left. IMMEDIATELY after your character appears, move the joystick Up. If you do everything correctly, your cop will be 'stuck' to the wall, and will be able to walk on the wall to the next stage.


* A specific Ase For The Same Trick : an easy way to get free lives is on the first level. Right after you leave the subway, keep your joystick pointed up. If you do this, you will 'stick' to the wall and nobody can touch you, though you can arrest tons of people (50 is the max). You can do this in other levels, though it does not seem to be as useful. One problem occurs right when you get out of the subway. There is a barrel which obstructs your path in/on the wall. You can just rocket it away if there are people behind the barrel (in respect to you). You can stay on the wall all the way to the passkey spot and into the door.


* To get ridiculous numbers of points and free men, you need to get to the end of the game, or at least where Mr. Big is. Once you've killed him (the little one *and* the big one), and you get to enter the treasure vault, just collect all the big gold blocks, and just wait. Don't do anything, just wait. After a while, the machine will send a pack of those annoying dogs after you. Let them kill you. You'll be sent back a stage in the game. And you have to fight your way back to the next 'bonus' exit door... once you do, mega-points and mega-men.


* Note the automatic teller machines present in a few places. March your character up to the machine and push into it; it should start spitting out money (evidence). Not HUGELY useful, but it's still kind of neat.

Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun (c) 1986 Technos.


The original side-scrolling beat-em-up from Technos. Kunio, a tough guy from Nekketsu High School, stands up for his bullied friend Hiroshi against the numerous gangs that are tormenting his life. Each stage begins with one of the gang's members beating up Hiroshi, followed Kunio chasing after the attackers.


The game uses a 2-way attacking, in which one button attacks to the character's left and the other to his right. Techniques includes a basic punch combo, a back kick, a collar grab and even a jump kick. The player can also run by pushing the joystick left or right twice.


The game is comprised of 4 stages, each with their unique set of enemy characters :


Stage 1 - Set on a train platform. The enemies are a gang of students from the neighboring school of Hanazono. Some of the enemies are armed with sticks. Their boss is Riki, Kunio's rival.


Stage 2 - Set on a harbor in Yokozuka. The enemies are a gang of bikers called the Yokohama Funky. The first wave of enemies will attempt to run Kunio down with their bikes. After knocking down all the bikers, the enemies on the sidelines will enter the playing field to attack the player. Their boss is Shinji.


Stage 3 - Set in a dark alley, the enemies are a gang of girl students from the Taiyou Academy. The boss is Misuzu, a giant lady.


Stage 4 - The first half of the stage is set in a parking lot, where a group of four hitmen working for the Sanwa Club will attack Kunio with their knives. Unlike other enemies, they can kill the player off with one hit. After defeating the four hitmen, the player will enter the Sanwa building where he will encounter three more hitmen and their boss, Sabu.

The title of this game roughly translates from Japanese as 'Hot Blooded Tough Guy Kunio'.


Kunio is named after Kunio Taki, the president of Technos Japan at the time. Kunio would return in the Technos arcade game "Nekketsu Koukou Dodgeball-bu", the Japanese version of "Super Dodge Ball", and would go on to star on numerous console games by Technos. A few of these were localized for the Western market, such as "River City Ransom", "Nintendo World Cup" and "Crash 'n the Boys - Street Challenge", where Kunio's identity would change from game to game (such as Alex or Crash Cooney).


Apollon Music released a limited-edition soundtrack album (Cassette format) for this game (Nekketsu Kouha-kun Sound Story) on 05/1987.


- UPDATES -


This game is the Japanese version of "Renegade". Most of the game's graphics (including the background for the first stage) were changed for Renegade and the game's plot was changed from fighting for a bullied friend to saving the main character's girlfriend.

Nemesis (c) 10/1985 Konami.


A superb and demanding shoot'em up that shares - along with Irem's "R-Type" - the destinction of being a true innovator of its genre and, again like R-Type, completely revolutionized the humble shoot-em-up.


Nemesis' eye-catching graphics guaranteed gamer interest but it was the game's genius ''weapon upgrade'' system that really made the difference. Never before could players actually CHOSE how to upgrade their ship. Destroying waves of enemies would often see the player reward with an 'orb' that could be picked up. The player could collect up to six orbs and could effectively 'buy' an upgrade from the six displayed at the bottom of the play area (speed-up, bombs, double, laser, multiple - which are orbs that follow the player's movements and add greater firepower - and a mystery 6th upgrade that is marked with an '?'). Game difficulty increases depending on how many power-ups the player has, so it is sometimes advantageous to NOT power-up your ship too much.

This game is known outside Europe as "Gradius".


First shoot-em-up with serious power-ups.


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Vol.1 - 28XA-85) on 27/06/1986.

Apollon Music released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Original Sound of Gradius - KHY1016) on 05/05/1987.


Interesting note : Several Konami arcade games ("Gradius", "Parodius Da! - Shinwa kara Owarai e", "Salamander", etc...) have the default high score set at 57300. '573' refers to Go-Na-Mi kana letters, a play of word for 'Konami'.


Bandai released a boardgame (in Japan only) based on this videogame (as "Gradius") in 1986 : The board is split into 8 sections, each with its own rules. The things that remain the same are that each uses a square-grid for movement, and you can power up your ship by getting the capsules.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Plan your power ups well : When starting/restarting the game, the regular shot being your only method of attack could be very tough. But that doesn't mean increasing your firepower by equipping MULTIPLE very first is good because you cannot move around quickly. You will end up being hit. Therefore, first power up your speed once or twice so you can move faster.


* DOUBLE and its problems : With DOUBLE, you can shoot in front of you and diagonally. However, since you cannot fire rapidly, it is not a weapon easy to use. Equip at least 2 MULTIPLE before equipping DOUBLE.


* Make good use of the LASER : Hitting enemies above and below you with the LASER is rather easy. You don't have to go for a direct hit. Make it fly near the enemy for a slight touch.


* MISSILE movement : The MISSILE moves along the ground. If there is something sticking out of the ground, the MISSILE stops there. Keep an eye on the landscape.


* Take control of the MULTIPLE : The MULTIPLE follow the path of VIC VIPER. Take advantage of this feature and attack enemies that VIC VIPER cannot reach. Use formations to wipe out th enemy!

Also, the faster VIC VIPER is, the more widely spread the MULTIPLE are from each other. Take advantage of this feature as well.


* Renewing the BARRIER : The BARRIER wears out not only by making contact with the enemy and enemy shots. It does so by touching the landscape. Make use of this trait and make the BARRIER touch enemies or the landscape to wear it down and get rid of it. Then equip a new BARRIER.


* Come up with a conquering pattern : This game is a shooter that gives you a lot of freedom in terms of how you can conquer levels. Learn the tips, remember the appearance patterns of the enemy, and come up with your own way of conquering the game.

Nemo (c) 11/1990 Capcom.


One night, as Nemo sleeps, he is visited in a dream by the King of Slumberland, who invites Nemo to come and play with the King's daughter, the Princess. Nemo finds himself unable to find the Princess however, so he and 'Flip', a strange companion who also turns up in the dream, decide to explore Slumberland and find the king.


Nemo is a colourful and abstract platform shoot-em-up set in the dream world of Slumberland, a surreal world in which childrens' toys are running amok and must be destroyed. Nemo is armed with a magical staff that emits a burst of magic to destroy the many enemies, some of which require multiple hits. A number of power-ups also appear at regular intervals to aid Nemo in his quest through seven tough stages.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Random Selection : Press A+B+C+D at the player selection AND/OR the course selection screen.


* Here are the different golfers we can select with their country and their statistics :

Young Hero (USA) : Driving 3 - Accuracy 3 - Skill 3 - Recovery 3 - Putting 3

Technician (United Kingdom) : Driving 2 - Accuracy 4 - Skill 5 - Recovery 4 - Putting 3

Veteran (Australia) : Driving 1 - Accuracy 2 - Skill 4 - Recovery 5 - Putting 2

Power Golfer (Brazil) : Driving 5 - Accuracy 1 - Skill 1 - Recovery 1 - Putting 1

Putt Master (Japan) : Driving 3 - Accuracy 2 - Skill 4 - Recovery 2 - Putting 5


* Sometimes contests appear during a circuit :

1) The closest to the pin contest : you have to hit the ball as close as possible to the hole in one hit. If the ball gets closer to the pin than the previous record, you will earn a bonus hole.

2) The longest driving contest : you have to shoot the ball as far as possible in one hit. If you exceed the previous record, you will earn a bonus hole.


* The order from the best to the worst performance is :

Albatros (3 hits less than for a Par)

Eagle (2 hits less than for a Par)

Birdie (1 hit less than for a Par)

Par (the average level)

Bogey (1 hit more than for a Par)

Double Bogey (2 hits more than for a Par)

Triple Bogey (3 hits more than for a Par)


If you miss the attempt to make a Triple Bogey, you will have to give up the hole and will suffer an additional penalty.

If the ball arrives out of bound or in the water, you will be penalized one stroke.

Released in May 1998.


NeoGeo Cup '98 is actually a hack of "Super Sidekicks 3" made by SNK themselves. His subtitle is a homage for "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory"


A serious bug : Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners dont use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tileset rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the mainboard z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attact loop after gameover, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.

Puckman (c) 1980 Namco.


The original Japanese version of the seminal and hugely influential arcade game in which the player guides the legendary Puckman around a single-screen maze eating dots. Puckman is constantly pursued in his task by four ghosts - Akabei (red), Pinky (pink), Aosuke (blue), and Guzuta (orange). Each ghost has its own unique personality and behavioural patterns and a single touch from any of the ghosts results in Puckman losing a life.


Four 'Power Pills' are situated in each corner of the rectangular mazes and eating one of these makes Puckman temporarily invincible; the four ghosts also change to dark blue in color and can now be eaten by Puckman. These 'Skinned' ghosts, now visible as a pair of eyes only, will then return to the den in the middle of the maze, regenerate into their former selves, and return to the maze to continue their pursuit of Puckman.


Each maze contains 240 dots and 4 Power Pills, and all must be eaten to complete the level; whereupon the entire sequence begins again with an increased level of difficulty.


Twice in every level, a bonus fruit or prize item will temporarily appear in the middle of the maze below the ghosts' den. Puckman can eat these bonus items to receive extra points. Also, there is an escape tunnel on the left and right hand side of the maze that Puckman can use to escape any ghosts that are currently closing in on him. The ghosts can also use the tunnel, but take longer to pass through it than Puckman, making escape a little easier.


Between certain rounds, funny intermissions will be played featuring Puckman and the ghosts in funny situations. 3 intermissions are present : 

1) Akabei chases Puckman across the screen and off the side. Then he re-appears running in the opposite direction, in his vulnerable form, followed by a giant Puckman! This intermission is played after Round 2. 

2) Akabei is again chasing Puckman, but this time he rips his red sheet on a nail on the ground, and we can see his pink body under the sheet! This intermission is played after Round 5. 

3) Akabei chases Puckman across the screen once more, this time with his sheet sewn. They disappear at the left side and then Akabei reappears coming back the opposite direction. This time he is bare and drags his sheet behind him. This intermission is played after Round 9, 13 and 17.


No intermission is present between rounds after the 18th one.

- TRIVIA -


This game is known outside Japan as "Pac-Man".


Puckman was first introduced to the Japanese arcade market in May 1980. The voracious little critter caught the hearts and imaginations of the public like no other game before it, and few since. It is still regarded as the hallmark of the 'golden age' of video games.


Toru Iwatani, author of Puckman : Puckman's character is difficult to explain even to the Japanese -- he is an innocent character. He hasn't been educated to discern between good and evil. He acts more like a small child than a grown-up person. Think of him as a child learning in the course of his daily activities. If someone tells him guns are evil, he would be the type to rush out and eat guns. But he would most probably eat any gun, even the pistols of policemen who need them.


The name Puckman (later changed to Pac-Man) comes from a Japanese slang term 'paku-paku', which describes the motion of the mouth opening and closing during eating and translates in English as 'to eat'.


Puckman was, quite literally, conceived at lunchtime. The game's designer, the then twenty-six year old Toru Iwatani, was very hungry and ordered himself a pizza for lunch. He took one slice, and, looking at the rest of the pizza, Puckman was born. However, in later years Iwatani has suggested the shape was based on the Japanese character 'kuchi', meaning mouth. He rounded off this shape, and created the classic shape. The game took 1 1/2 years to complete and had five people on its team. Puckman is the greatest selling arcade game of all time and is arguably also the world's most recognized video-game character of all time. It had its own cartoon, lunch box, board game, stickers and hundreds of other products. This was largely due to Puckman being the first truly distinctive video-game 'character', and it changed the face of video games forever. Puckman was the first video game to be as equally popular to women as it was with men.


After the 255th level, Puckman presents the player with the infamous 'split-screen' level, where the left-half of the screen is normal, but the right-half of the screen is garbled with a mess of letters, numbers, symbols and other graphics. This level cannot be completed.


The alien spaceship "Galaxian" makes an appearance as the prize in the 9th and 10th boards.


Note : Excluding bootlegs, there are 23 different name/nickname combinations for the ghosts in "Pac-Man" (27 including 'Sue' from "Ms. Pac-Man", 'Tim' from "Jr. Pac-Man", and 'Funky' and 'Spunky', both from "Pac-Mania").


The original Puckman was available in two different cabinets from Namco, an upright and a cocktail. There were also alternate cabinets produced by Hanly, Kenphone Electronics, Karateco, NSM Play, Bell Fruit MFG, and several bootleg game manufacturers....


* Namco Upright - The original Namco upright version came in a white cabinet that may look familiar to most gamers. This cabinet is the same 'swoopy' design used for "Pac-Man" and "Galaxian". The only actual design difference was the coin door. Puckman had a tall coin door with a single coin mech, while "Pac-Man" had a fat coin door with two coin mechs installed. However, the graphics on the machine were completely different. The marquee had the 'Puckman' logo off to the side at an angle, and showed a scene with half a dozen cartoon Puckmen eating power pellets, with a few ghosts lingering off to the side. The monitor bezel was largely red and was of a circular design and had many Puckmen lounging around the perimeter of the circle. The control panel continued the reddish graphics and had instructions in Japanese, along with a yellow ball-top 4-Way joystick and start buttons for each player. The sideart was a large circular sticker that advertised the game's name, and had many cartoon Puckmen in action around the edges of the circle, with the word Namco displayed prominently at the bottom. The cabinet was finished off with yellow t-molding on the edges.


* Namco Cocktail - The Namco Cocktail was a table style unit and had almost no decorations at all, merely an instruction card underneath the glass, and some pictures on the control panel. There seems to be several different versions of the control panel graphics, but most of them show cartoon Puckmen on them. This table is not the same design as the "Pac-Man" cocktail, in fact it appears to use an almost identical design to Sega's "Carnival" including the strange coin mechs (it is very possible that they were the same cabinet, as many game makers bought their cocktail cabinets from third parties, and then simply installed the games into them).


* Kenphone Electronics Upright - Kenphone actually produced a better looking Puckman than Namco did. They used their own sturdy cabinet design, and featured painted sideart of Puckman singing into a 50s style microphone. The rest of the graphics scheme was predominantly dark blue, and the marquee simply bore a centered Puckman logo. This cabinet was of a better design than Namco's, and these machines tend to be in better condition than real Namco units.


* Hanly Cocktail - Hanly made a few cocktail units that were identical to the Namco cocktail in design, but had all their instructions in english, and have the word 'Hanly' substitued for 'Namco' everywhere on the machine.


* Bell Fruit MFG Upright - The Bell Fruit upright was available only in the United Kingdom. This was Bell Fruit's standard mini arcade cabinet with a simple Puckman marquee that featured a few small ghosts and some images of cherries. The monitor bezel was similar to the circular design on the original Namco version, but all the pictures of the Puckmen were different, and all the instructions were in English. This machine had no sideart and the control panel was unadorned.


* NSM Play Upright - The NSM upright was sold only in Germany. At a glance it looks fairly similar to the Namco upright, but if you look a bit closer you can see that all the decorations on the machine are of low quality, and it comes off looking like a cheap bootleg, even though it was an official Namco licensed version. The instructions on these machines are usually in German.


* Bootlegs/hacks Upright - This final version is a complete fake, but there are a lot of them. They seem to use converted Namco cabinets, painted white, and are decorated with very strange looking sideart that shows Puckmen and ghosts that look nothing like the ones on any other Puckman/"Pac-Man" products (since when has Puckman had green frogs legs?). The marquee has an odd Puckman logo in yellow and orange, along with a picture of the blue ghost and the strange 'frog legged' Puckman.


A Bootleg of this game is called "Ghostmuncher". Some hacks are known as "New Puck X", "Newpuc2" and "Joyman".


- UPDATES -


The monsters have names and nicknames which were, in "Pac-Man" : Shadow (Blinky), Speedy (Pinky), Bashful (Inky), and Pokey (Clyde). They are red, pink, blue, and orange in color, respectively.  In the original Puckman, these monsters were named Oikake (Akabei), Machibuse (Pinky), Kimagure (Aosuke), and Otoboke (Guzuta). Puckman also had a DIP switch for alternate ghost names : Urchin (Macky), Romp (Micky), Stylist (Mucky), and Crybaby (Mocky).


- SCORING -


Dot : 10 points

Power pill (energizer) : 50 points

Ghosts : 200, 400, 800, 1,600 points

Cherry : 100 points.

Strawberry : 300 points.

Peach : 500 points.

Apple : 700 points.

Pineapple : 1,000 points.

Galaxian : 2,000 points.

Bell : 3,000 points.

Key : 5,000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* An extra life is awarded at 10,000 points (You can change this value with the dip switches).


* Fruits appear twice on each board. The first fruit appears after Puckman has eaten 70 dots; the second fruit appears after 170 dots have been eaten by Puckman.


* At the beginning of a round, the ghosts won't immediately pursue Puckman. Use this time the best as you can.


* Puckman can turn corners faster than the ghosts can, so turning many corners can help you escape ghosts.


* The tunnel allows Puckman and the ghosts to instantly travel from one side of the maze to the other. While traveling through the maze, Puckman moves at normal speed, but the ghosts' speed is reduced in half. This provides Puckman with a good opportunity to put some distance between him and his pursuers, but be careful not to get trapped by another ghost entering the opposite side. 


* If you hold the joystick in a direction that is blocked by a wall, Puckman will turn in that direction as soon as he reaches a passage leading in that direction. Remember this to turn corners as fast as you can.


* Remember that eating dots will slow Puckman a little bit: avoid parts of the maze in which you've not been yet if you are trying to escape ghosts!


* Mind that, as the levels increases, the ghost speed increases as well!


* In later rounds, you're not going to be able to eat ghosts after eating an energizer, because the vulnerability time decreases to zero. This is when you need to learn how to avoid the ghosts understanding their movement and their moving patterns!


* Right above the ghost den, there are two paths leading upward to upper part of the maze. The ghosts never travel upward through these holes while they're in their dangerous forms; they only do while they're vulnerable after Pac-Man has eaten an energizer! Indeed, they only exit the area around the den from the sides or the bottom. These are not completely safe corners, since ghosts can travel downward through them, anyway they often represents a safe passage to flee from ghosts pursuing you around the den.


* Ghosts' Movements : First of all, remember that ghosts are not always following you! Their movements follow two distinct phases: one in which they avoid Puckman and one in which they hunt him down. In the former phase, each ghost patrols his personal corner of the maze. In the latter one, they will try to find Puckman, following their personal 'behavior'. Namely :

1) Akabei (Red ghost): he tends to patrol the top-right corner of the maze and he follows Puckman always trying to minimize their respective distance; 

2) Pinky (Pink ghost): he tends to patrol the top-left corner of the maze and he follows Puckman trying to reach a position slightly in front of Puckman, in the direction he's moving;

3) Guzuta (Orange ghost): he tends to patrol the bottom-left corner of the maze and he only tries to be close to Puckman, without hunting him directly; 

4) Aisuke (Cyan ghost): he tends to patrol the bottom-right corner of the maze and he has the most complicated AI since he moves towards a point determined by both Puckman's position and Akabei's position.

Ghosts alternate these two different behaviors (hiding and hunting) a few times in each round, then they start to pursue Puckman restlessly until all the dots are eaten, or they manage to catch him.

Additionally, as soon as a certain number of dots has been cleared from the maze (this number decreases as the levels pass), Akabei's speed will increase and he won't stop to search for Puckman anymore.

New Rally-X (c) 1981 Namco.


In New Rally-X, the player drives a car around a maze picking up all of the yellow flags, of which there are 10, before the car's fuel runs out. The game-play has a similar feel to another Namco legend, "Pac-Man"; although in New Rally X's mazes are much larger and, with each maze having only 10 flags to collect, is more sparsely populated than Namco's pill-eating legend.


In-game opponents consist of red enemy cars that try to ram into and destroy the player's car, a problem compounded by the fact that enemy cars are faster than the player's. A smoke screen can be activated which trails behind the player's car and causes any pursuing enemies to crash. Each maze also has rock formations which, if crashed into, will result in the loss of a player car. A radar display to the right hand side of the playing area shows the positions of both the flags and the enemy vehicles.


New Rally X is an update of the 1980 release, "Rally-X". The sequel has slightly different graphics to the original game, and has more forgiving gameplay.

- TRIVIA -


Released in February 1981.


While the original "Rally-X" released under a Bally Midway license was a moderate hit in the United States, Bally Midway only distributed this updated version as an upgrade kit for Rally-X cabinets. The game appeared quite frequently in mainland Europe and the United Kingdom, mainly in the form of uncredited bootlegs. It was at least as popular as Rally-X in these regions, if not more so, primarily due to the game's greater playability and abundance of bootleg board stock.


- SCORING -


Collecting a flag : 100 points x the flag collected up to a maximum of 1,000 points.

Special Flag : Doubles points for all flags collected. If collected first, the last flag is worth 2,000 points.

Lucky Flag : Bonus points x Remaining Fuel.

End of screen bonus : Points for remaining fuel.

The New Zealand Story (c) 1988 Taito.


Set in Antipodean country of the game's title, The New Zealand Story is an incredibly cute and challenging platform game featuring Tikithe Kiwi bird, possibly the most lovable arcade character ever created. Tiki's fellow Kiwi birds have been kidnapped by an evil walrus and Tiki is charged with rescuing his friends.


The New Zealand Story is a superb, constantly inventive and very demanding platform game that features a wide variety of intelligent and distinctive enemies; such as heavily armed ducks, angry walruses, and whales made of ice that spit giant snowflakes.


During his quest, Tiki can commandeer a variety of different weapons and vehicles - the latter of which include balloons and a hovercraft. The level design is superb, with exploration often rewarded with either bonus items, alternate routes to the end of the level, or secret level warps that transport the player to a later level (see 'TIPS AND TRICKS' for more details).

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


The following is for the Japanese version of the game which, curiously, was the version that tended to be converted to the various home formats; regardless of territory


Throughtout the game there are several hidden 'Warp' gates, which take you to secret areas and later levels.


Round 1-1 : In the last room of this stage, there are 3 identical platforms placed above one another. Go to the highest one, face left and jump about whilst shooting, after 5 shots a warp should appear. This takes you into a enclosed box on round 2-1, only this time it has got the 'E','X','T' letters. There is an escape warp to the right which you must shoot to make it appear. From here you are taken to round 1-4 (in an unaccesible area below the boss room) where you'll find the green 'E','N','D' letters, you now have your first extra life. To get to know more about round 1-4 (which is important in the game) keep on reading.


Round 1-2 : In the start area, jump onto the second platform and shoot to your left 5 times. A warp should appear, enter it and you'll be taken to a room of the secret round (the secret round is a place where almost ALL of the secret rooms are found - like separate rooms in any level - and you can't visit more than one at a time, since they are all separated by closed walls). There are two large columns with water one to either side of you. Each has an open Warp above it. The right warp will take you to an upper place in level 1-2, where you simply collect some apples (for points) and then continue through the level normally. The left warp, which is the better of the two, takes you to a place under the level. Going from left to right, you find a place with upwards tunnels you can jump in. Go to the one full right, since there you will find the letters 'red E' and 'X'. Then, going all the way up, you are just near the cage at the end of the level.


Round 1-3 : This level has two warps...

1) The first needs a vehicle and is just after you fly down to the big open area of this round.  Fly downwards while staying close to, and facing the left-hand wall, keep firing towards the wall and about two thirds of the way down, the first Warp will appear. This will take you to a secret round where you collect the 'red E','X', 'T','green E' letters then on a hidden place of round 2-1,where you collect the 'N' and 'D' letters : EXTEND, and also you can choose to finish round 2-1 OR...

2) The second Warp is in the last room. Climb out of the water and head straight upwards - the trapped Kiwi is to your left). This will take you to a secret round, which also has got a secret warp in it! The round has the 'TEND' letters, exits to 1-4, and a Warp exit to 2-2.


Round 1-4 : This round has a Warp, but it's only accesible from another Warp that appears on a LATER level (2-1). Once you have come to this level via the Warp on 2-1, go to the platform directly UNDERNEATH the Boss room (after you've collected the letter), the Warp is in the far left corner of the upper-most platform underneath the Boss room and takes you to level 2-4.

Note : The trick of using the 2-1 warp to go back to 1-4 infinitely doesn't work in the WORLD revision. The programmers added some blocks to the box so that the Kiwi cannot be sucker in the warp.


Round 2-1 : This is one of the key rounds of the game, as it allows for one or two tricks and has two warps. The first one is in the right corner of the closed box at the end of the level. You can get inside the box from the warp on level 1-1. However, it's possible to enter the Warp from OUTSIDE the closed box by using a flying vehicle and, for preference the laser weapon or Fire Staff.. If you've only got arrows ,bombs, or a laser and no vehicle, take advantage of the microbes that appear nearby. Keep killing them anytime they appear (if you move away from the screen where they appear they will appear more often) until the Fire Staff appears. Once opened, just jump in it from below. You will be taken BACK to the secret area in level 1-4. This means that you can effectively keep going BACK to level 1.4 through the Warp as many times as you wish, stocking up on points and bonus lives as you go.


Should you chose NOT to do this, you can head for the second Warp. First, ensure that when you are at the enclosed box and that you also have a vehicle. Simply fly OVER the enclosed box and drop down behind the caged Kiwi. On your right there is a 'ladder', go up this and you'll be in a small, enclosed room; shoot the lower-left edge of the room and the Warp appears. This will take you to an independent secret level which has 2 possible exits. The first is at the end of the level - after the yellow lift you head down and left and drop through a hole in the floor - this takes you to level 2-3. The second exit is a warp. Stand on the yellow rising block and jump from it so you can stand on the wall to your right (you would do this anyway, to avoid the ceiling spikes and get to the exit...). Shoot 5 times and a Warp appears. This will take you to another secret level - with a number of enemies - and the letters 'Green E' and 'T'. Take the letters, kill all of the enemies and enter the Warp that subsequently appears.


Round 2-2 : The only warp on this level is in the upper right-hand corner and can only be reached with a vehicle. This takes you to the end of the level.


Round 2-3 : Also one warp on this round. This is found in the place left to the 'Red E' (bottom righ of the level). This will take you to a place with a 'Red E' and an 'X', and a warp from there to an advanced point on level 2-3.


Round 2-4 : Before the Boss Room (the one with the octopus) shoot to the right - standing on the blocks over the spikes - and a warp will appear on the fifth block from the left. This leads to a secret level with enemies and the letters 'T' and 'Green E', and THEN to level 3-1, inside the 'box'.


Round 3-2 : There is a warp near to the end of the level on the wall between the two 'pools' of water with waterfalls, This will take you to a room in the secret level, with a church for background. Nothing to take, just a warp on the floor that will take you to level 3-3.


Round 4-1 : This round has got 3 warps, the maximum in this game. The first (and most rewarding) is over the last diagonal row of spikes, in the upper 'dry' part of the level (most of the level is underwater). Fly up there, shoot 5 times as usual and take the warp. It will take you to a place in the secret round and then to level 4-4. There are two further warps that can be found in a long, left-to-right section, just after you have passed the BIG masses of water.


Round 4-4 : This level has two sub-areas, divided by a barrel at the end of the areas. In the area with the horizontal 'barrel', there is an empty space below it. Shoot it and a warp appears. This takes you to a room in level 2-4, with 2 letters, an 'E' and an 'X', and then you take a warp in that room that takes you to the second area of level 4-4.


Round 5-1 : This is the last level known to have a warp. Walk on the floor with the small volcano until the last platforms on the left. Go up and then left, you will fall down to a place with some blocks and more volcanos. Shoot to the right right, and take the warp. This takes you to a room in the secret round with 2 red E's and another Warp to a secret level room - with two X's - and from there to level 5-1 again, near the big room.


* Heaven Rounds : The heaven levels are secret levels that can only reached when Tiki has lost all of his previous lives and is killed by a SOLID PROJECTYLE (such as arrows, stones, bombs, boomerangs, spears, etc.) If you drown ,fall on spikes or lava, get burned by laser, flames or UFO missiles, or are killed by contact with an enemy, a life is lost. The Heaven levels only appear after level 3.1.


* Teddy Bear Cheat : In the demo mode during the attract mode, press fire 3 times, and a cute picture of a bear will appear in the bottom-left corner of the screen.

- TRIVIA -


Released in December 1982, this is the first game to support a billion point score.


Rock-ola offered a free Nibbler machine to the first player to turn the game over by scoring a billion points. The early favorite was Tom Asaki, who came close but failed in attempts at Twin Galaxies arcade in Ottumwa IA (once when the joystick broke after he scored 793 million points). Tim McVey finally broke the billion-point barrier with a score of 1,000,042,270 points after six unsuccessful attempts (he passed out after one of them) and January 28 1984 was declared Tim McVey day in Ottumwa.


McVey's record stood until February 22, 2009 when Dwayne Richard exceeded him with a score of 1,004,328,140. On April 10, 2009, McVey attempted to regain his Nibbler WR and recorded his progress through a webcam which was streamed from the Twin Galaxies website and Ustream.tv. However after almost 40 hours of gameplay and 945,939,420 points, McVey was forced to walk away after developing a blister in his hand. His attempt was one of the first to be recorded and streamed through the internet.


- SCORING -


Food Item : 10 points x level.

Time Bonus : 10 points per remaing on clock x level.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Nibbler does pause for a split-second when it hits a corner, so use this pause to decide your next turn.


* Try to collect the items on the inside of the maze first, as you can use the outer edges to move relatively safely when Nibbler is longer.

Night Driver [Highway sitdown model] (c) 1976 Atari.


Night Driver is a simple two-dimensional driving game. Your perspective is from behind the wheel of the car as you drive down the highway. The object is to score points by getting as much distance as possible in the least amount of time. Those who are good enough can get bonus time for a specific amount of points. Beware, though, it will not be as easy as it seems.


- TECHNICAL -


From Dave Shepperd : "The game was designed to fit in an upright cabinet and it sold very well in that configuration. Later, our ID manager thought to fit it into the left over Atari Highway sitdown cabinets of which we may have had a few dozen or maybe a few hundred stuck in a warehouse somewhere. It also sold very well in that configuration. I understand kits were made to retro-fit Atari Highway cabinets already in the field and those sold well too".

- TRIVIA -


Also released as "Night Driver [Upright model]".


This game was first released by a small company named Micronetics and later picked up by Atari (October 1976). Night Driver was the first 'first-person' driving game (only Atari's second sitdown, "Hi-Way" was the first). 2100 units were produced.


After a nearly 50-year run, the mid-1970s video games like Night Driver spelled the end of the electro-mechanical arcade games (such as "Killer Shark" seen in the movie Jaws). Video games would spawn a nation-wide phenomenon which has gone on to this day.


Night Driver was one of many mid-1970's Atari games such as "Starship 1", "Sprint 2" and "Drag Race" which were often found at carnivals and bowling alleys. Kids would flock to these establishments just to get an opportunity to play the games rather than the primary source of entertainment they offered. When the 80's arrived, video games could be found everywhere including grocery stores and kids didn't have to go very far to play their favorite game.


From Dave Shepperd : "This was the second game I programmed while at Atari. I was given a piece of paper with a picture of a game cabinet that had a small portion of the screen visible. I don't recall if it was an actual flyer for the game or simply a Xerox of the front page of the flyer. I recall it being German or maybe I was just told it was a German game. I never saw the game play nor did I know what scoring was used on that game, only that there were a few little white squares showing. With that germ of an idea, out popped Nite Driver. I have fond memories of spending time watching the white lines in the street and fence posts whiz by my car as I drove to and from work trying to work out in my mind's eye what kind of math I can use to make little squares on a TV kind of do the same thing.".


A Night Driver unit appears in the 1978 movie 'Dawn of the Dead'.


- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is really simple. Your score is tied to distance traveled so obviously you want to cover the most amount of distance in the shortest period of time.


The game will start you off with either 100 or 125 seconds to get the required 350 points for extra time.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, you will have a choice of which track you want to drive on. Your choices are : Novice, Expert, and Pro. The track selected directly effects your points/distance ratio. Obviously, the harder the track the faster the points go up. Of course, the harder the track, the more twists, turns, and narrow sections you must deal with.


* Try to stay in the middle of the road as much as possible. Especially around curves since it is very easy to run into the fence posts.


* Learn how to use the gears and gas pedal with proficiency. This is better to let up on the gas or downshift on curves then trying to barrel through them at top speed. It takes a lot more time to get off a fence post then if you had just taken the curve slower.


* Your goal is to get the points necessary to get bonus time. Once you get proficient at one track, go to the next track. After a while, you will find that the Expert and Pro tracks are actually easier then the Novice track.


* Steering on this game is pretty easy although you need to watch out since the car does have a tendency to drift. Small corrections in the steering should keep that problem in check.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


By holding the A button until the attack gauge reaches full and then releasing it, you can unleash a burst of magical energy that can affect many of the enemies on screen. However, this has an effect similar to what happens in Final Fight: when you use this power, it decreases some of your life gauge.


By pressing the C button and then the A button, you can perform a special somersault attack that can be used to knock down a couple enemies in a row.


Only the main 2 players, Joe and Hayabusa, can pick up special weapons like swords, hachets and maces. The other 3 players (Musashi, Kagerow, and Gembu), who become selectable after appearing as sub-bosses, do not. To let go of a special weapon that you've picked up, press the B button.

Ninja Commando (c) 1992 Alpha Denshi.


3 ninjas are sent on a mission to stop a madman named Spider from trying to use a time machine to mess with history. The game is almost like a tongue-in-cheek reworking of "Time Soldiers", which Alpha Denshi made 5 years earlier, with ninjas as the protagonists this time.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


The more you press the A button repeatedly, the more firepower you'll produce.


Press the A and B button together to fire shuri-ken (star-shaped blades). Unlike the main firepower, which is only straight ahead, the shuri-ken can be fired in all directions by moving the joystick in the opposite direction of which you wish to aim (example : to fire to the left, move the joystick to right and vice versa). This is also the best way to deal with a few of the bosses here : for example, on the stage set in feudal Japan, there are two giant sumo wrestlers who appear as sub-bosses. The main firepower seems to only have minor effect on them, but the shuri-ken are much more effective.


The C button is for firing magical bursts of energy. One drawback is that, similar to "Final Fight" this can cause a little of your life energy to be drained, so it should be used very carefully.

- TRIVIA -


Developed by ADK.


Released in May 1996.


The subtitle of this game translates from Japanese as 'Supreme Ninja Arts Scroll'.


The main design, as well as some of the special moves of the character 'Karasu' seem to be quite inspired by the main character of the 1994 movie hit 'The Crow' which was in turn, based on the graphical novel of the same name by James O. Barr (Even the name 'Karasu' stands as the Japanese word for "crow"!). :)


The character 'Nobunaga' is based on the real Japanese warrior 'Nobunaga Oda' who, during Japan's medieval period, overthrew the Ashikaga shogunate and ended a long period of internal strife by uniting half of Japan's provinces under his rule. In doing so he paved the way for the reunification of the country under the Tokugawa shogunate in the following century. His merciless use of power as well as his skill as a military strategist made him one of the most powerful & feared leaders in Japan. The image of him in the game as a warrior who wields the demons power may have been some sort of a criticism to his eager embrace of Western culture, religion & technology.


The character 'Goemon' is based on Ishikawa Goemon, the most famous thief in Japan on the Edo era (about 400 years ago) known to steal large sums of money from bad people and give the money to the poor. In other words, he was Japan's very own version of Robin Hood!


The character 'Sasuke' seems inspired on Sarutobi Sasuke, a famous legendary ninja with a strong sense of justice created in Tachikawa literature at the end of the Meiji period. Another source of inspiration may have been 'Ninja Kamui' an old anime series whose main character Kamui was an incredibly skilled ninja who wanted to abandon his ways as a killer thus becoming a 'nukenin' (runaway ninja) and marked for death by his own clan that vows to pursue and eliminate him.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Play As Ranmaru And Nobunaga (Player 1) : Highlight Kamui and press Left, Down, Left, Up, Left, Down, Left, Up, Right, Down, Right, Up and hit C+D.


* Play As Ranmaru And Nobunaga (Player 2) : Highlight Sasuke and press Right, Down, Right, Up, Right, Down, Right, Up, Left, Down, Left, Up and hit C+D.


* Time Attack Mode : At the character select screen, highlight Kamui and press Down, Left, Up, Left, Down, Left, Up, Left, Down, Right(x4), Up, C+D. Now choose your character.


* Successfully complete the game with a single credit within 8:30:00 minutes and the game shows you how to execute your character's 'finisher' move!

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Self defense - Shurikens and other projectiles can be deflected by your sword after you have collected the power-up scroll allowing you to swing your sword in an arc.  When walk along, you can shield yourself with this by holding the stick up, and swinging your sword.


* Defeat the first boss with ease - Assuming you have collected the sword powerup and have both shadow duplicates, position yourself in the center of the screen while the boss is rising from the ground and do a super jump (hold up and jump).  When you land on the ground, you should have your shadows flatting in mid air above you.  Select the sword and hold up and continuously slash - you will damage the demon and his flames will get blocked by your barrage of attacks.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as ''Castle of Gold''.


This game is known outside Japan as "Gladiator".


Guaranos and Irene appear in Allumer's "Blandia" as the selectable characters Gurianos and Irriana respectively.


- UPDATES -


This version has a nudity feature not present in "Gladiator". See ''Tips and Tricks'' section for more information, the female warrior Irene is shown with bare breasts (In Gladiator she still wears a bikini top when defeated this way).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* If you move fast UP and DOWN for a while you should activate a shield.


* How to strip Irene's clothes off : After breaking her sword, if her shield is not entirely broken, break it. Irene, unlike the other characters, has TWO suits of armor. DO NOT KILL HER! Try to remove as many parts of the armor as you can, throwing careful attacks. Focus especially on her chest-plate and on the... uh...'thigh-plate'?. After you've done that, defeat her BY ATTACKING HER LEGS. She will fall on her knees, with her sword on her hands against her chest. When you pass her, she extends her arms towards you and... HELLO!

Omega Race [Upright model] (c) 1981 Midway.


When playing this game, you are the pilot of an Omegan Space Fighter in training to defend Omega's Star Colonies. You are stationed in space to destroy as many waves of attacking enemy droid ships as possible.


You begin your training with a small number of droid ships in the first wave of attackers and gradually build your skill until there is a maximum number of 12 attacking droid ships per wave. These attaching ships not only move independently and fire at you, they also drop two different kinds of space mines to block your path and your shots at them.


As your skill level increases, the speed with which the droid ships attack is gradually increased and their shots at you become more accurate.


Bonus ships are awarded to you periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values. Each enemy ship and mine has a point value.


The object of the game is to survive as long as possible while destroying as many attacking droid ships and space mines as you can. As you do this, each following wave of attackers will be harder to destroy.

- TRIVIA -


Released in June 1981.


Omega Race was Midway's only vector game created.


Also released as :

"Omega Race [Mini-Myte model]"

"Omega Race [Sit-Down model]"

"Omega Race [Cocktail model]"


According to Arcade Engineering co-founder (and former Allied Leisure designer) Jack Pearson, the idea for Omega Race came when some designers obtained a copy of Atari's "Asteroids" and created a new game by putting masking tape on the screen to create a track and they ignored the asteroids and were trying to fly around the track.


Omega Race differed significantly from "Asteroids" in a few respects. First, there was no 'wrap-around' (where you exit on one edge and return to the opposite edge). The walls would stop the player's fighter if it impacted them. Second, all the information such as high score and ships left were in a box in the middle of the playing field. Last, you could be expected to encounter multiple attackers in each wave. Although Omega Race wasn't a big seller, it still created a following. Unfortunately, this game came out when games such as "Pac-Man" were at their peak.


One thing of note is that the high score table will not display the initial FUK or FUC (early censorship at its best).


Thomas Gault holds the official record for this game with 3,290,900 points.


A bootleg of this game is known as "Delta Race".


- SCORING -


Photon Mine : 350 points

Vapor Mine : 500 points

Droid Ship : 1000 points

Command Ship : 1500 points

Death Ship : 2500 points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your fighter will be in either the left or right corner of the screen. The enemy Droid Ships will be in one of the lower corners diagonally opposite from your fighter. Your job is to eliminate all the enemy Droid Ships in order to advance to the next wave. You will start with six enemy Droid Ships in wave one. The number of Droid Ships will increase by two until you will be dealing with twelve enemy Droid Ship per wave. Not only will you have to deal with enemy Droid Ships, you will also have to deal with the mines that they lay.


* The spinner knob is very sensitive on this game. That means you don't have to turn it too much to make your fighter respond. This can be very helpful if you are attempting to line up a shot and you 'overspin' the knob, thereby leaving yourself vulnerable to an enemy attack.


* Go down the side opposite of where the enemy Droid Ships are. Since you have rapid fire, try to destroy as many enemy Droid Ships as possible. This will become important in later waves since multiple Command and Death ships will appear amongst the enemy Droid Ships.


* When moving around the screen, make sure you keep firing toward the enemy ships. Although shots in this game have a limited range, if you put up a wall of fire, you can catch the enemy Command or Death ships in a nasty trap. Keep in mind that your rate of fire is only limited by how fast you can push the fire button.


* If you accelerate too much in one direction, turn your fighter toward any one of the walls so that you ram it. This will cause your fighter to instantly stop so that you can get your bearings again to deal with enemy threats.


* After the second wave, the enemy Droid Ships tend to migrate around the middle box in a direction opposite of where your fighter appears. After the fourth wave, the enemy Droid Ships tend to split up with a Command ship with each of these groups to make your job even harder.


* Command ships located in the pack of enemy Droid Ships will not pursue your fighter. This doesn't mean, however, that they aren't helpless. If you get too close to one of these packs, that Command ship will fire on your fighter.


* Enemy fire isn't the only danger you will have to deal with. Command and Death ships also deposit mines. If you don't destroy the Photon mines, they eventually become Vapor mines. Both of these mines can present a major obstacle if you are trying to get away from the enemy or trying to set yourself up into a better firing position.


* If you take too long to bring down a Command ship, it will transform into a Death ship. Death ships are much harder to hit because they fly quickly around the screen shooting and laying mines.


* Don't get to close to any Command or Death ship since both of these ships have pretty accurate fire when they get close to your fighter.


* After Wave 5, a Droid Ship will transform into a Death ship near the beginning of the wave to create an even bigger challenge of getting through the wave.

Operation Wolf (c) 1987 Taito.


A light-gun game in which the player takes on the role of a soldier and must infiltrate an enemy army base. The object is to capture six bases and to save any hostages encountered on the way.


Each mission begins with the player carrying a limited amount of machine gun bullets and rockets, but extra ammunition can be collected by shooting any gun magazines or rockets that appear on screen.


Any civilians or hostages that the player shoots will result in a reduction to the player's health meter (which is displayed on the right-hand side of the screen). Farm animals, in the form of a chicken and a pig, will occasionally run across the screen; Shooting these will reveal bonus items such as health or ammunition.


Once the game is completed, the player is returned to the first mission, but with an increased level of difficulty.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Time your grenade shots to wipe out more than one enemy vehicle at a time. It is rarely smart to use a grenade on a single vehicle. Grenades are not plentiful enough to use in this fashion.


* When the large, blond enemy soldiers (with toting large machine guns) appear in stage four (Ammo Dump), shooting them in the face will take them down quickly. Otherwise, a grenade or lots of bullets will be required. Also in stage four, keep a stream of fire going just to the right corner of the mortar behind the sandbags. You will plug the guy shooting at you early and you will not be distracted by incoming mortar fire.


* Each round cleared heals three damage points and the village round heals twenty damage points. If you are playing on a generous machine (mucho power drinks) or an easy machine and you are a great shot, you may have less than three damage points near the end of the first stage (enemy radar) or less than twenty damage points near the end of the village scene. If so, leave one helicopter alive. When it flies on screen, pump it with nine bullets. This gives you points and you can finish it with one shot if you need to. The helicopters often take just one damage point and take a long time to deliver their damage. All the while they do this, power drinks, grenades, and ammunition may show up so you can stock up before the round has to end. Blow-up the helicopter when you have three or twenty damage points depending on the round.


* On the fifth stage (Concentration Camp), you are likely to finish this round shooting foot soldiers. If you are a good shot, wait until they flash. Sometimes, the enemies do not flash or shoot. The longer you delay the end of the round, the more likely you are to have ammo, grenades, and power drinks drift into the scene.


* If you play a game that allows you to select the scene in which you fight, choose the village when you have 15-20 damage points so you can make the most of the village's healing bonus where twenty damage points will be removed. Also, do not select the ammo dump. It uses more ammo than it gives, delivers inevitable damage to you, and the three helicopters the ammo dump sends to reinforce the final round are nothing compared to the onslaught you face at the ammo dump.

Out Run [Sit-Down model] (c) 1986 Sega Enterprises, Ltd.


Out Run puts the player behind the wheel of a red Ferrari Testarossa in this ground-breaking and hugely popular racing game. As with most games of the genre, players must reach the end-of-stage 'goal' before the tight time limit expires. Out Run's lush, colourful levels are all packed with civilian traffic that, in addition to the tracks themselves, must be carefully negotiated. Upon crashing, the player's car doesn't explode or come to a sudden halt as with other games of the time; it flips into the air before crashing to the ground and eventually rolling to a stop; throwing the driver and his female passenger from the car in the process.


As well as being able to choose which route to take through the game, players can also choose from one of 3 different catchy songs to listen to while driving. The 3 songs are : 'Magical Sound Shower', 'Passing Breeze' and 'Splash Wave'.


- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1986.


Also released as :

"Out Run [Upright model]".

"Out Run [Deluxe Sit-Down model]".


At the end of each stage, before the end-of-stage goal is reached, players are presented with a fork in the road; a unique innovation that, for the first time in the history of racing games, gave players a choice of which route they wished to take through the game. Out Run's game-play was both tight and instinctive and, together with the superb stage design and wonderfully realized sprite-scaled graphics, would completely revolutionize not just racing games, but arcade games in general.


Out Run is still regarded as perhaps the finest arcade racer (and certainly the finest sprite-driven racer) of all time. This was especially true of the deluxe cabinet version, which featured a fully hydraulic tilting cabinet (resembling a red Ferrari Testarossa) and a powerful speaker system situated directly behind the player's head. The sublime music still captivates many fans today, although the sublime 'Magical Sound Shower' is generally regarded as the finest of the three in-game tunes on offer (the others being 'Passing Breeze' and 'Splash Wave'). The final tune, 'Last Wave', is only played when the high-score table is displayed.


At least part of Out Run's huge success was down to it capturing the fun-yet-superficial spirit of the 1980s. Previous racing games had concentrated on the more serious side of racing, with the action usually taking place in a Formula One racing car, over a series of competent but uninspiring racing tracks. Out Run was different; in a decade that celebrated style over content, the game offered players the ultimate boy racer experience by putting them behind the wheel of that eighties icon of cool, a red Ferrari Testarossa; replete with a 'blonde bimbo' in the passenger seat.


Sega didn't actually have (nor indeed ask for) permission from Ferrari to use one of their cars for the game. This inevitably led to a degree of bad feeling and threats of litigation between the two companies. They have since settled their differences, however, as Sega acquired an official license to use the Ferrari range in its 2003 sequel, "Out Run 2".

Richard Jackson holds the official record for this game with 52,897,690 points.


In the film 'Donnie Darko', Donnie is playing Out Run at an arcade with his girlfriend. The scene shows him crashing his car during their discussion.


An Out Run cabinet can be seen in the 1988 educational video presented by General Motors called 'The Game Of Your Life'.


A MTV public announcement against drunk driving shown in the mid '90s shows a gamer in their viewpoint playing Out Run whilst under the influence of alcohol and cuts to each point where the gamer crashes until the end of game.


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Sega Taikan Game Special - 28XA-198) on 12/1987.


Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Outrun/SEGA S.S.T. - PCCB-00081) on 02/1992. Composition by SEGA Sound Team and arrangement by SEGA S.S.T. Band. The first 3 tracks are arranged versions.


- UPDATES -


In "Out Run [Deluxe Sit-Down model]", all the courses are in a different order.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Fatest route : the fastest route for finishing the game is Right (Devil's Canyon), Left (Snowy Alps), Right (Wheatfield), Right (Autobahn).


* Secret credit message : right before the road forks, press and hold Start. When you choose one of the roads and the other one disappears from view, a secret credit message will come up on the screen.


* Instead of just pressing the accelerator all the way when you're about to start, you should instead try to keep the gas in 'the high greens' and just below red. The exact moment the green light goes on you should give it as much gas as possible thereby starting up much faster. Instead of shifting at app. 170mph you should change gears at about 120 mph to avoid slowdown. This hint earns you app. 1 second. This trick works every time you have to start from 0 mph but is difficult to time right when you don't have the green light for timing.


* The second before going off road you can change very quickly to low gear and then high gear again. If done correctly you can drive off the road without any slowdown for about 1-2 seconds. If you time it right you can actually change to low then high again after the 1-2 seconds and not loose ANY speed whatsoever when driving offroad. This way you can keep going 292mph even though you're offroad.

P-47 - The Phantom Fighter (c) 1988 Jaleco.


P-47 is a two-dimensional, scrolling shooter type of game. You play as the pilot of a P-47. Your mission is to basically destroy as many of the enemies as you possibly can. This means eliminating as many air and ground units as you can. You will be going through four missions (each being broken up into two parts) and at the end of each of these parts is an enemy boss for you to tangle with. Although you have unlimited ammunition, the enemy will make you pay for the invasion into their homeland. You will be able to accomplish this with various power-ups and also a second player (if they buy in). Your mission won't be easy but it is necessary so you can secure both the skies and ground for our troops.


The game is broken up into four missions. Within these four missions, there are 2 parts. One part involves going over land and the other part has you either going over water or being up in the air. Regardless of which part you are on, you will still have to deal with the same basic things. After part two of mission four, the missions will repeat again with mission one.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


As soon as you start the game, you will immediately be placed into the thick of the action. Be ready for anything.


* This game is very fast-paced and it only gets harder as you progress through the missions. This means you will have to be constantly aware of what is happening from both in the air and on the ground.


* Your fighter has unlimited firepower in both bullets and also auxiliary weapons such as bombs and missiles. Use this to your advantage by laying down a solid wall of firepower to prevent any enemy units from getting close to your fighter.


* Make sure, though, that you are constantly aware of where an enemy unit is because you will also have to gauge where its fire will be heading. In addition, most enemy units move so they basically will 'shoot and scoot' making it harder for you to pinpoint their location.


* To take care of units that like to roam around, lay down a 'carpet' of bombs or other heavy firepower. Your bombs drop down much faster than an enemy unit can move so you can basically overwhelm them with superior firepower.


* Some enemies require more then one hit to take them out. This means you will have to use a combination of different offensive weapons to destroy them. This will be especially true when you are fighting the bosses.


* Make sure you know the lay of the land at all times. Some topography has some extremes in both hills and valleys. Sometimes your only choice is to go above a mountain peak that has a lot of ground and air units guarding it. This means you will have to unleash some serious firepower to make it safely over.


* Ensure that you know how to regulate your speed depending on the current conditions. You can go no further to the front than the right side of the screen nor any further back than the left. Use this speed-up, slow-down to avoid enemy fire and to eliminate targets before they become unmanageable.


* Make sure you eliminate all helicopters that have items so you can ensure you have the right kind of power-up plus you can also get free men.


* When you encounter large formations of planes, the best weapons are the missiles or exploding bombs. These can clear out large holes in those formations plus they can prove rather deadly to the bigger planes as well.


* Overall, this game involves the application of massive amounts of firepower in order to survive the next mission. This isn't to say, however, that paying attention and constantly moving aren't also important... they are vital to your survival.

Pac-Land (c) 1984 Namco.


In the cartoon world of Pac-Land, a fairy is lost and needs Pac-Man to help her get back to her home in Fairyland. Pac-Man's efforts are hampered by his ever-present enemies in the form of five deadly ghosts - Pinky, Inky, Blinky, Clyde and Sue - who constantly pursue Pac-Man as he travels through the colourful world of Pac-Land. When Pac-Man has helped the lost fairy get back to her home in Fairyland on the final stage of each trip, he is given a pair of magic shoes to help get back to his own home in Pac-Land.


In this, the 8th game in the seminal series, Namco opted to steer the series away from the maze-based antics of Pac-Man's previous adventures and instead created a colourful, sideways-scrolling platform game. This change of direction necessitated the addition of arms, legs and a face to the previously basic Pac-Man character, although much of the design work had already been completed for the 'Hanna-Barbera' cartoon series upon which the game is based.


Directional buttons make Pac-Man walk right or left, and it's possible to make him run by pressing down on a directional button repeatedly. Pac-Man must avoid the ghosts and other deadly objects that populate Pac-Land, either by jumping over or dodging them; unless, of course, he has picked up one of the mandatory Pac-Man 'Powerpills' that litter the levels which, as in Pac-Man's previous outings, make him temporarily invincible and turn the ghosts blue and vulnerable to being eaten. Each stage must also be completed within a set time limit, otherwise Pac-Man will be constantly pursued by a ghost. On some stages, Pac-Man must use a springboard to jump over large ponds. Everytime Pac-Man makes it to the end of a stage, a bonus will be awarded based on how much time is left. On each stage, there are cherries and other items which Pac-Man can collect to score points.


Upon reaching the end of the final stage, Pac-Man will be given a pair of magic shoes that will help him on his way home. When he has reached home, he will meet with Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp the Pac-dog and Sourpuss the Pac-cat. The game then begins again.

- TRIVIA -


Released in August 1984.


Licensed to Bally Midway for US manufacture and distribution (October 1984).


This game was influenced by Hanna-Barbera's Pac-Man cartoon, which ran from 1982-84. The character designs and music are taken directly from the show. The background music that plays during the levels is the same as the cartoon's theme song.


Mark Mendes holds the official record for this game with 4,150,400 points.


- UPDATES -


(Midway), (set 1) and (set 2) versions enable you to pick your stage, (Set 3) just goes into stage 1.


In the Japanese release, Pac-Man's nose is longer, and he wears a hat with a feather in it. Also, the game is much more easier and slower than the others country version.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Round One : jumping on the first three fire hydrants to generate five cherries is quite safe as you don't have any cars until after the third hydrant. Continuing you can see another fire hydrant just after the Pac-Pill. Straight after getting this you can push the fire hydrant backwards getting a helmet. This enables you to collect the babies that the ghosts throw from their planes (you lose your hat if you run out of time or die).


Round Two - The Forest : the first 'cheat' is achieved by pushing the second cactus back -  giving you 80,000 points and transporting you to your house at the end of level two. If this doesn't work then try the second, third and fourth logs in the woods. The machine randomly chooses one of these (pushing the logs only works if you haven't died and you have 15,000 points). Get the cherry that appears as it turns into another three.


Round Three - The mountains : these have no cheats - but watch out for the plane that always flies over the first mountain (a flower sometimes grows here and in many other places, I am sure that this means nothing). After completing the mountains you pass two cacti. Pushing the first one back, on earlier versions, makes you invisible and invincible to everything except the water (which just happens to be the next obstacle!) To jump over the water - run at full speed over the spring board and at the edge press jump and keep on whacking the joystick to the right - you should glide over the pool! You have then reached Fairyland! Here the Queen gives you a gift of magic boots that enable you to fly. You then start Round 4 going back the opposite way.


Round Four - Journey home : you first encounter cacti that you must jump over. If at any point you see the letter 'S' in a Pac bubble flying about - get it - it's an extra life. There is also another letter in a Pac bubble that flies around the screen - the letter 'L' - this can be achieved after getting a Pac-Pill, getting four ghosts and then Doris fifth (Doris is the one that chases you and the only one that has no hat after eating a Pac-Pill). The last cactus that you jump over is very tall. Try pushing the lower section of it backwards as this generates 7 balloons. Six of which are worth 100 points but one is worth 7650 points. Get this and don't bother with the others. Continue going home once you reach the town, jump on all fire hydrants as this always generates cherries. If pushing the cactus back didn't do anything then try pushing the second to last fire hydrant back - this will generate the balloons. When you arrive home you can still jump to get 7650 points.


Round Five - The Town : jump on the fire hydrants to generate cherries. Push the third hydrant back to give you the hat. If you pass two fire hydrants on top of each other then jump on top of these. The blue things that push you along (water jets) can also push you on top of the houses. This is advisable as it keeps you away from any double decker buses! If the second fire hydrant didn't give the helmet then the fourth fire hydrant along will.


Round Six - The water pool area : you have two short(ish) pools to clear, followed by more ghosts on pogo sticks (here appears another floating cherry). The last pool is the longest of these and must be judged carefully to clear.


Round Seven - The water jets : you have three different platforms to jump on (always try to stay on the highest one). If a flying water jet happens to hit you then whack the joystick everywhere and press fire as it is possible to escape. Not much on this round, just collect loads of strawberries. After this you reach fairyland again, you receive the boots again, and have to return home.


Round Eight - The trip home : firstly, you have to cross the long pool - backwards. Jump to the top of the screen straight away to get the cherries and clear the planes. There are stumps sticking out that you can land on and get cherries. After this there is the forest to complete. The first or second to last log will give the balloons. 


Round Nine - The Water Pool Area : you leave your house and go straight into the water pool area. There are three cacti on this round. Pushing either the first (before the pool), second (before the skeleton) or third (before the Pac-pill) back will give you the helmet. The pool is slightly different as it has a stump sticking out of the water that has an extra spring board you can land on. After this there is a skeleton (that drags you down into the ground) and must be jumped over.


Round Ten - The forest : pushing one of the logs back will make you invincible to the ghosts. This works even if you have died. When you start flashing, the invincibility is about to ware off.


Round eleven - The logs and clouds : much like the one on Trip 1 except after jumping the logs, you have to jump onto clouds (although not essential as Pac can clear all the cloud jumps in one). After this you reach fairyland yet again and you receive the boots.


Round twelve - The trip home : first collect the three cherries. Then you have to jump backwards over a large pool - with no stumps. After this you reach the town. One of the few fire hydrants gives the balloon's.


Round 13 - The Town : this level has many double hydrants. Jump on these and wait for the water jet to push you up onto the houses. Walking along the houses gives you some cherries. On many versions there is no helmet on this round.


Round 14 - The cavern : you have to collect the keys to open the doors. The first key is on the top layer. Jump up there to get it. Keep going right and fall down the hole. Keep going right and fall down the next one too (you should now be on the bottom layer). Keep going right (staying on this level) and open the door. Keep going right. Jump up through the next hole and get the apples. Continue right, fall down the hole and get the key. Use this immediately to open the door. Keep going right, do not jump through the first hole and stay on the lowest level. You can then get two apples, jump through the hole and get a key, and then fall through another hole to get another two apples. Continue right and after opening the door, jump through the holes to get from the bottom level to the top. Open the door you reach and go through. Fall through the next two holes (so that you are back on the lowest level). Open the door you reach and get the two apples. Return through the door you've just come through, jump to the middle layer and continue right. You will now be out of the cavern and have reached 'break time'. So long as you don't waste time and keys it is actually easy.


Round 15 - The water jets : i think that pushing one of these fire hydrants may give the helmet, but I'm not too sure. Watch out for the planes at the very end of the level. Try to jump on them.


Round 16 - The trip home : the first gives the balloon's. Next it's the mountains. The is normally an extra life lurking around the second mountain so go backwards once for it if it doesn't come (an 'S' in a Pac). Then is the forest. The first log encountered gives the balloon's if the cactus didn't.


Round 17 - A forest level : on some versions of the machine the very first cactus will give the helmet. Just before the water is a Pac-Pill and it is quite easy to get the time bonus. After the pool, there is a short forest, following that is a spring board that must be used to clear a second pool that cannot be seen from that point.


Round 18 - The cavern : you only have limited sight. The first key is on the lower level. Go right, then jump up to the middle level, then jump up to the top layer. Keep going right and fall down a hole to the middle layer (you'll be in between two doors). Jump back up to the top level (making sure you don't open either of these. Once back on the top level, keep going right and you'll reach a door. Open it and get the key directly behind. Keep going right, fall down to the middle layer, get the key, fall down to the lower level, collect the fruit. Open the door you come across. Don't jump through the next hole, but through the one after that. Jump to get the key (fall straight back down again). Keep going right. Jump up through the next hole, go right, and fall down the next. Open the next door (you're still on the bottom level) and jump through the next hole. Then jump up to the top level, open the door and get the fruit. Go through on the top and open the end door. Fall through the holes and go to the bottom level. Go right and collect the fruit there. finally, go to the middle level and exit to 'Break Time'.


Round 19 - The mountains : clear these and the clouds as usual, but watch out for the planes at the end (over the part with three sets of moving logs). Enter fairyland.


Round 20 - The return home : this is very easy. Keep on going left, You first hit a forest. Watch out for the ghost near the end. This is followed by a pool, get all the cherries on the way, but DON'T stop for anything. Then you reach another forest, then another pool, then the last forest (watch out for another ghost here) and then the town. By the time you reach the town you will be out of time and must run full speed from Doris. Try to get the Pac-Pill but if you miss it, don't go back for it!


Round 21 - The town : this is hard as there are so many ghosts. It is pointless jumping onto the double hydrants as getting on top of the houses may involve hitting a plane. Try to stay on the top of the double-decker busses, jumping from one to another. This will stop you needing a run up. The Pac-Pill at the end can only be got by first jumping onto a ghost. Don't bother with it unless you are already on a ghost. Go straight for 'Break Time'.


Round 22 - The mountains : as well as the clouds, you meet a new section - four logs in water that must be jumped onto and crossed. Careful judgement is needed here. Get the Pac-Pill afterwards as you'll need it. Time is short so don't stop for anything.


Round 23 - The water jets : this gets hard towards the end as there are many ghosts around. Try to stay on the planes. You then reach fairyland.


Round 24 - The trip home : first are the water jets to cross. This is quite easy as there aren't many ghosts and enables you to collect a lot of fruit. Then you enter the town. The last part of this is very hard. Just jump for the Pac-Pill when you see it and hope you get it before you are killed! Don't wait around.


Round 25 - The woods : there are two woods split up by lots of skeletons. DON'T use the spring board or you will hit one of the planes. All of the skeletons are fake apart from the first and last. So don't worry about touching them. When you enter the first wood, look for the helmet at the fourth log. I think it is hidden in there.


Round 26 - The mountains - again! : this time you don't have many logs to jump on and there are very few clouds. Most of the mountains have to be jumped without any clouds. This level also contains the logs in water and is the furthest that I've ever got.

Pac-Man (c) 1980 Namco.


The seminal and hugely influential arcade game in which the player guides the legendary Pac-Man around a single-screen maze eating dots. Pac-Man is constantly pursued in his task by four ghosts - Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (blue) and Clyde (orange). Each ghost has its own unique personality and behavioral patterns and a single touch from any of the ghosts results in Pac-Man losing a life.


Four 'Power Pills' are situated in each corner of the rectangular mazes and eating one of these makes Pac-Man temporarily invincible; the four ghosts also change to dark blue in color and can now be eaten by Pac-Man. These 'Skinned' ghosts, now visible as a pair of eyes only, will then return to the den in the middle of the maze, regenerate into their former selves, and return to the maze to continue their pursuit of Pac-Man.


Each maze contains 240 dots and 4 Power Pills, and all must be eaten to complete the level; whereupon the entire sequence begins again with an increased level of difficulty. 


Twice in every level, a bonus fruit or prize item will temporarily appear in the middle of the maze below the ghosts' den. Pac-Man can eat these bonus items to receive extra points. Also, there is an escape tunnel on the left and right hand side of the maze that Pac-Man can use to escape any ghosts that are currently closing in on him. The ghosts can also use the tunnel, but take longer to pass through it than Pac-Man, making escape a little easier.


Between certain rounds, funny intermissions will be played featuring Pac-Man and the ghosts in funny situations. 3 intermissions are present :

1) Blinky chases Pac-Man across the screen and off the side. Then he re-appears running in the opposite direction, in his vulnerable form, followed by a giant Pac-Man! This intermission is played after Round 2.

2) Blinky is again chasing Pac-Man, but this time he rips his red sheet on a nail on the ground, and we can see his pink body under the sheet! This intermission is played after Round 5.

3) Blinky chases Pac-Man across the screen once more, this time with his sheet sewn. They disappear at the left side and then Blinky reappears coming back the opposite direction. This time he is bare and drags his sheet behind him. This intermission is played after Round 9, 13 and 17.


No intermission is present between rounds after the 18th one.

- TRIVIA -


Released in October 1980.


Licensed to Midway for US manufacture and distribution. 96,000 units were produced in the U.S.


Pac-Man was first introduced to the arcades at the end of 1980 and immediately captured the hearts and imaginations of the public like no other game before it, and few since. It is still regarded as the hallmark of the 'golden age' of video games.


Toru Iwatani, author of Pac-Man : Pac Man's character is difficult to explain even to the Japanese -- he is an innocent character. He hasn't been educated to discern between good and evil. He acts more like a small child than a grown-up person. Think of him as a child learning in the course of his daily activities. If someone tells him guns are evil, he would be the type to rush out and eat guns. But he would most probably eat any gun, even the pistols of policemen who need them.


Developed by Namco, the original Japanese release was called "Puckman" but, due to the West's predilection with changing words to vulgarities by scratching part of the word off (in this case, changing the word 'Puck' to something rather less socially acceptable by scratching off part of the letter 'P'), was changed to 'Pac-Man'. The name Pac-Man is derived from the Japanese slang term 'paku-paku', which describes the motion of the mouth opening and closing during eating and translates in English as 'to eat'.


In Brazil, the game was unofficially named by the children as 'Come-Come' (lit. he eats-he eats, in Portuguese). Also an onomatopoeic, from the sound the character does when walking/eating. In Italy, the same sound is referred as a meaningless 'Gabo Gabo'. In Spain it was called 'Comecocos' (coconut-eater).


Pac-Man was, quite literally, conceived at lunchtime. The game's designer, the then twenty-six year old Toru Iwatani, was very hungry and ordered himself a pizza for lunch. He took one slice, and, looking at the rest of the pizza, Pac-Man was born. However, in later years Iwatani has suggested the shape was based on the Japanese character 'kuchi', meaning mouth. He rounded off this shape, and created the classic shape. The game took 1 1/2 years to complete and had five people on its team. Pac-Man is the greatest selling arcade game of all time and is arguably also the world's most recognized video-game character of all time. It had its own cartoon, lunch box, board game, stickers and hundreds of other products. This was largely due to Pac-Man being the first truly distinctive video-game 'character', and it changed the face of video games forever. Pac-Man was also the first video game to be as equally popular with women as it was with men. Pac-Man's cult status in the early 80s was such that it even inspired a hit song by 'Buckner and Garcia' called 'Pac-Man Fever', released on the album of the same name.


* A place in video game history : 'Pac-Man is the most universally known arcade game', said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. 'Everybody knows about Pac-Man. And, I've noticed, almost everybody can play Pac-Man pretty well. Pac-Man makes just about the best use of the joystick one can imagine. It's so intuitive that it puts other games to shame in terms of how easy it is for a person to walk up, stick a quarter in the machine, and start doing something meaningful. At the time, Pac-Man introduced a completely unique style of game play and was also highly identifiable in terms of its music. With Pac-Man, everything was there. The video game industry needs another game that captures the public's heart like Pac-Man, and so far, no one has been able to come up with it.'.


* The great 25-cent escape : Lindsey says, 'People expect to see Pac-Man when they come into the museum, and without fail, when they see it, they want to play it; people remember spending hours and hours at Pac-Man. They like to see how good they are now when they play it. And I would say that, perhaps more than any other game, the same playing skills still apply. Perhaps it's because of the intuitive game play. You don't have to memorize the behavior of a wide array of enemies as you do with some other games.'.

You just have to remember that when the ghosts turn blue, you only have seconds, until they start seriously blinking, to go and get them. And Pac-Man is a little looser in its style of game play - more open. For instance, you can kill time in the lower left hand corner until you see an opening between the ghosts, and you can strategize a bit more : You can play with the tunnels, you can play with the position of the ghosts in relation to the energizers. Even people who haven't played in years remember those strategies.

You can also get into some really fun jams, Lindsey continues : 'When you've got a ghost on your tail and you have to make a decision about whether you're going to go left, or right, or straight at the next junction, which is in .03 seconds. It gets to be pretty tense, especially when those ghosts start moving really fast and the energizers aren't lasting as long. Pac-Man can be a real heart-thumping game.'.


After the 255th level, Pac-man presents the player with the infamous 'split-screen' level, where the left-half of the screen is normal, but the right-half of the screen is garbled with a mess of letters, numbers, symbols and other graphics. This level cannot be completed because there are not enough dots on screen to be eaten! This is the result of a bug in the routine drawing the fruits at the bottom of the screen, according to the round number. Indeed, the code works as follows:

1) it increases the last round number by one;

2) it checks if the result is smaller than 8 (in this case, you still would not have enough fruits to fill the line and some blank space must be drawn);

3) it checks if the result is larger than 19 (in this case, it has only to draw keys); 

4) finally, it fills the bottom bar with the correct fruits.

In particular, if the round number is smaller than 8, the game draws as many fruits as the previous round number. This produces an undesirable effect right after the 255th level. 

Indeed, 256=255+1 becomes 00 for the CPU (which expects to use the last 2 hexadecimal digits only, and 256=100 in hex)! 

Therefore, the game thinks to be in one of the first 7 levels (because 0 is smaller than 7), but it tries to draw 255 fruits (because the last round number was 255). Of course, there is no space for that many fruits to be displayed and the game starts to draw garbage on the main screen.

Fixing the original code (either through a cheat in emulation, or hacking the roms on the PCB) would results in a 256th level identical to the first one (cherries will appear) but harder, since ghosts will behave as they do in levels beyond the 19th.


The alien spaceship "Galaxian" makes an appearance as the prize in the 9th and 10th boards.


Reportedly, when Bally/Midway obtained the rights to Pac-Man, Namco was offering four different games, which ended up being licensed to Game Plan and Bally/Midway. Game Plan's Ken Anderson reports that he and Bally's Dave Marofske flipped a coin to see who would get first crack at the games. Game Plan won and chose a tank game (which they released as "Tank Battalion") over Pac-Man. The other game they got was released as "King & Balloon". Bally/Midway, meanwhile, took Pac-Man and "Rally X".


The game also spawned a virtual cottage industry of best-selling how-to books strategy guides on how to beat the game by using patterns with names like the "Bazo's Breaker", the "Donut Dazzler" and the "GET pattern" (named after the first initials of the members of a team of players from Davis, California: George Huang, Ed Bazo, and Tom Fertado).


Note : Excluding bootlegs, there are 23 different name/nickname combinations for the ghosts in Pac-Man (27 including 'Sue' from "Ms. Pac-Man", 'Tim' from "Jr. Pac-Man", and 'Funky' and 'Spunky', both from "Pac-Mania").


'Galaxian' boards will run in Pac-Man machines, but the sound pinout is different, so the pinout at the connector would have to be modified. To fire, one would have to press UP on the joystick.


Billy Mitchell, Rick Fothergill, Chris Ayra, Tim Balderramos and Donald Hayes all hold the official record for this game on 'Regular (TGTS)' settings with a perfect score of 3,333,360 points on July 3, 1999, July 31, 1999, February 16, 2000, December 4, 2004 and July 21, 2005, also, respectively.

Chris Ayra holds the official record for the fastest time to get a perfect game on 'Regular' settings with 3:42:05 on April 2, 2002.

Ron Corcoran holds the official record for this game on 'Speedup' settings with 1,321,020 points on May 13, 2001.


Hacks of this game are known as "Hangly Man", and "Caterpillar".


A Pac-Man unit appears in the movie 'Getting There', in the 1982 movie 'Jekyll & Hyde - Together Again', in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance', in the 1985 movie 'The Heavenly Kid', in the 1985 movie 'Better Off Dead', and in the 1986 movie 'The colour of Money'.


A Pac-man Unit appears in the pilot of Season One of the A-Team. It is where Amy meets Murdock for the first time


MB (Milton Bradley) released a boardgame based on this video game (Pac-Man Game) in 1982.


'Pac-man' is also the nickname of the Filipino boxing champion Manny Pacquiao. The two-time world champion earned the distinction as the only boxer who has knocked down both future Mexican 'Hall of Famer' Marco Antonio 'Baby Face Assassin' Barrera (knocked out in 11th round)and Erik 'El Terrible' Morales (knocked out in 10th round). Pacquiao has been on the top 10 list of the best 'pound-for-pound' fighters in the world.


In the multi-racial country of Malaysia, 'Pac-Man' is a slang coined to describe men who only date ladies of other races.


The name 'Pac-man' has been given to a nebula, cataloged as NGC 281. The Pac-man Nebula is an H II region in the constellation of Cassiopeia. It includes or is near the open cluster IC 1590, the double star HD 5005, and several Bok globules. The shape of the nebula resembles the famous video game icon, Pac-Man. It is visible in amateur telescopes from dark sky locations.


- UPDATES -


As mentioned earlier, Pac-Man's ghosts have names and nicknames which were : Shadow (Blinky), Speedy (Pinky), Bashful (Inky), and Pokey (Clyde). The are red, pink, blue, and orange in color, respectively. In the original "Puckman", the ghosts were named Oikake (Akabei), Machibuse (Pinky), Kimagure (Aosuke), and Otoboke (Guzuta). Puckman also had a DIP switch for alternate ghost names : Urchin (Macky), Romp (Micky), Stylist (Mucky), and Crybaby (Mocky).


Midway's new revision program for Pac-Man was released in December 1981, the new program increases the difficulty of the game and adds a new challenge to players already familiar with the original.


The Bootleg version on the 'Galaxian' hardware has different colors and screen proportions. Credit, Level & Lives remaining are incorporated in the Maze section (look at the middle exits). The sound is also quite a bit different.


- SCORING -


Dot : 10 points.

Power pill (energizer) : 50 points.

Ghosts : 200, 400, 800, 1600 points.

Cherry : 100 points.

Strawberry : 300 points.

Peach : 500 points.

Apple : 700 points.

Pineapple : 1000 points.

Galaxian : 2000 points.

Bell : 3000 points.

Key : 5000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* An extra life is awarded at 10,000 points (You can change this value with the dip switches).


* Fruits appear twice on each board. The first fruit appears after Pac-Man has eaten 70 dots; the second fruit appears after Pac-Man has eaten 170 dots.


* At the beginning of a round, the ghosts won't immediately pursue Pac-Man. Use this time the best as you can.


* Pac-Man can turn corners faster than the ghosts can, so turning many corners can help you escape ghosts.


* The tunnel allows Pac-Man and the ghosts to instantly travel from one side of the maze to the other. While traveling through the maze, Pac-Man moves at normal speed, but the ghosts' speed is reduced in half. This provides Pac-Man with a good opportunity to put some distance between him and his pursuers, but be careful not to get trapped by another ghost entering the opposite side. 


* If you hold the joystick in a direction that is blocked by a wall, Pac-Man will turn in that direction as soon as he reaches a passage leading in that direction. Remember this to turn corners as fast as you can.


* Remember that eating dots will slow Pac-Man a little bit: avoid parts of the maze in which you've not been yet if you are trying to escape ghosts!


* Mind that, as the levels increases, the ghost speed increases as well!


* In later rounds, you're not going to be able to eat ghosts after eating an energizer, because the vulnerability time decreases to zero. This is when you need to learn how to avoid the ghosts understanding their movement and their moving patterns!


* Right above the ghost den, there are 2 paths leading upward to upper part of the maze. The ghosts never travel upward through these holes while they're in their dangerous forms; they only do while they're vulnerable after Pac-Man has eaten an energizer! Indeed, they only exit the area around the den from the sides or the bottom. These are not completely safe corners, since ghosts can travel downward through them, anyway they often represents a safe passage to flee from ghosts pursuing you around the den.


* Ghosts' Movements : First of all, remember that ghosts are not always following you! Their movements follow two distinct phases: one in which they avoid Pac-Man and one in which they hunt him down. In the former phase, each ghost patrols his personal corner of the maze. In the latter one, they will try to find Pac-Man, following their personal 'behavior'. Namely :

1) Blinky (Red ghost): he tends to patrol the top-right corner of the maze and he follows Pac-Man always trying to minimize their respective distance; 

2) Pinky (Pink ghost): he tends to patrol the top-left corner of the maze and he follows Pac-Man trying to reach a position slightly in front of Pac-Man, in the direction he's moving;

3) Clyde (Orange ghost): he tends to patrol the bottom-left corner of the maze and he only tries to be close to Pac-Man, without hunting him directly; 

4) Inky (Cyan ghost): he tends to patrol the bottom-right corner of the maze and he has the most complicated AI since he moves towards a point determined by both Pac-Man's position and Blinky's position.

Ghosts alternate these 2 different behaviors (hiding and hunting) a few times in each round, then they start to pursue Pac-Man restlessly until all the dots are eaten, or they manage to catch him.

Additionally, as soon as a certain number of dots has been cleared from the maze (this number decreases as the levels pass), Blinky's speed will increase and he won't stop to search for Pac-Man anymore.


Easter egg :

1) Enter service mode.

2) Press and hold the 1P and 2P buttons and toggle service mode off and on quickly to bring up the alignment grid.

3) Enter the sequence: Up(x4), Left(x4), Right(x4), Down(x4).

4) MADE BY NAMCO will appear sideways in red.

Pac-Man Plus (c) 1982 Bally Midway.


The monsters are the same, if their edible forms are changed. The maze is familiar, if a bit off in color. The prizes in the center are a bit different. Be careful, however : you may eat an energizer and find that Red Monster you wanted to chomp into at the dot still red and you now dead. Also, you might want to try eating the monsters after eating the center prize. They'll turn dangerous after turning visible.

- TRIVIA -


Pac-Man Plus was developed by Bally Midway without the approval of Namco. Released as an upgrade kit for the original "Pac-Man" where the action on screen has been 'upgraded' so that the old patterns and tried-and-true ways of playing no longer have any validity.


Shannon Ryan holds the official record for this game with 3,213,900 points.


- UPDATES -


The programming is is a lot like "Pac-Man" except that the maze is outlined in green instead of blue. The prizes that appear in the middle of the maze are cans of Coke, cocktails, green beans, cakes, gift-wrapped boxes, etc. Whenever Pac-Man eats an energizer, the ghosts not only turn blue but they also get apple stems on their heads. On later levels, sometimes only three of the ghosts turn blue.


The game plays exactly like the original except that there are various events (apparently selected at random) that may or may not occur after Pac-Man eats one of the four power pellets. These events include but are not limited to : the maze's structure becoming temporarily invisible, the ghosts turning invisible while they are blue, or only three of the four ghosts turning blue. The prizes in the middle of the maze can also act as a power pellet. Another difference is that later in the game the maze's structure becomes permanently invisible.

Pac-Mania (c) 1987 Namco.


Pac-Mania is a 1- or 2-player (alternating) game in which players maneuver the new Pac-Man through a world of 3-D mazes. He's back in action... but with a new twist, BOUNCE power! Ready for a new generation of Pac-Man players, he can't wait for the chance to show off his new aerial maneuvers to the crowd! The "boss" ghost Clyde has recruited the talents of 2 new ghosts, Sue and Funky. Pac-Man must use his speed and cunning to outwit these annoying pests.


Pac-Man now faces new challenges as he enters the worlds of Block Town, Pac-Man's Park, Sandbox Land, and Jungly Steps. Fortunately for Pac-Man, he has the help of 2 'special items' - a green and red power pill. The green pill adds temporary speed, and the red awards double points. It's a whole new ball game for Pac-Maniacs!


Game play begins with the opportunity for players to level select among one of three playfield worlds : Block Town, Pac-Man's Park or Sandbox Land. With Block Town being the easiest and Sandbox Land being the harder, players are accordingly rewarded for selecting and completing the challenges in this mode.


The player's main objective is to eat all dots and power pills in the mazes while avoiding persistent ghosts. Using the new BOUNCE button, players can bounce their way over the ghosts to avoid being caught. But two new ghosts have been added to insure that Pac-Man doesn't have it too easy. In fact, one of them can also bounce in the air like Pac-Man. Fortunately, these rivals of Pac-Man are only found in the more demanding worlds and mazes.


During play, the appearance of fruit and green/red power pills will trigger the bell. This alerts players immersed in the game who might otherwise miss these valuable items. A green power pill awards extra speed; it is good until a yellow or red power pill is eaten and expires or a game life is lost. Red power pills award double points, and continue to do so until a game life is lost.


An optional continue feature is offered to allow players to continue their progress without having to start back at the beginning. It's a great way for Pac-Maniacs to learn and practice strategies without having to re-start games from the beginning. Bonus thresholds are offered at various score values, and are adjustable.

- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1987.

Licensed to Atari for US distribution.


After the superb platform action of the series' previous game, "Pac-Land", Namco chose to return the series to its roots with the re-introduction of the 'eat all of the pills in the maze game-play of the earlier classics. Pac-Mania feels somewhat different to its illustrious predecessors, however, due to Pac-Man's newly-acquired 'jump' ability. The mazes are now rendered with an isometric, pseudo 3-D viewpoint, allowing the player to jump over the chasing ghosts and make an escape.


The 'Pac-Man's Park' maze is basically the original "Pac-Man" maze in an isometric 3-D perspective.


Another new feature in this game is the appearance of several 'special items' (in addition to the traditional fruit bonuses - cherries, strawberries, oranges, apples, bananas, apricots, bells, and keys). These items include candy, hamburgers, ice cream cones, coffee, and 2 special kinds of power pills. The pills, which appear in addition to the traditional power pills, give Pac-Man more points for eating ghosts and also give him extra speed, both of which come in very handy during game-play. Pac-Mania was to be Pac-Man's last arcade outing.


Donn Nauert holds the official record for this game with 385,570 points.


Victor Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Namco Video Game Graffiti Vol.4 - VDR-5282) on 08/03/1989.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* On the first couple of stages where power pellets last long, try to get 3 or 4

ghost near a power pellet. Once they are there, it is possible to eat all of

the ghost on the board. You'll also rack up lots of points this way after

eating the Pink Pill.


* On later stages, try clearing the pellets on top of the maze first. Not all of

the ghost will come out at once, once the level starts.


* On later stages, power pellets won't last long. Use those to distract the

ghost as you clear the board.


* Jumping is very important. You can jump at least 3 ghost lengths.


* When a ghost is on your tail, a good way to lose him is to turn around and

jump over the ghost.

Pang! 3 (c) 1995 Mitchell.


The second sequel to the superb 1989 original, Pang! 3 retains the same gameplay of its predecessors but adds vastly improved graphics and a choice of three difficulty levels; Beginner, Normal and Panic. On both the 'Normal' and 'Panic' skill levels, players can choose from four different playable characters; each possessing different strengths and weaknesses, such as a double harpoon or quick shots. On the beginner level, players can only use the mexican character.


Another notable difference is in the game's use of backdrops : instead of the world landmarks of the first 2 games, Pang! 3 features classical works of art in the form of paintings and sculptures.

Paperboy (c) 1984 Atari Games.


PAPERBOY is a 1-or 2-player (alternating) game with a medium-resolution color raster video display. The handlebar control maneuvers the PAPERBOY through his paper route. Press either button on the handlebar control to throw papers. Your main objective is to deliver papers to your customers from Monday through Sunday, eventually completing an entire week of delivery Successfully completing an entire week of deliveries concludes the game.


You begin the game with ten customers and ten non-customers. Your customers live in the brightly colored houses; non-customers live in dark colored houses. To deliver to a customer, you must throw a paper either on their porch or into their mailbox. Failure to deliver a paper to a customer results in the loss of that customer on the next day. Any damage done to a customer's property also results in the loss of that customer. Losing all ten of your customers will get you fired and your game is over. However, each time you deliver to all your customers you will receive a Perfect Delivery Bonus for that day. And, if you have previously lost any of your ten customers, you will get one of them back as a re-subscriber.


Non-customers' houses and yards are loaded with targets at which to throw your extra papers (windows, lamps, statues, etc.). Upon hitting any of these targets, its respective point value goes into the Breakage Bonus, which is displayed at the top center of the screen. The Breakage Bonus is awarded to the player at the end of each day (or at the end of the game-whichever comes first).


If you lose a customer, that customer's house will be dark colored the next day. As a non-subscriber, this house now presents more targets at which to throw for building up your Breakage Bonus.


PAPERBOY can carry a maximum of ten papers at a time, but can restock his supply by riding over paper bundles placed here and there on his route. A paper supply indicator is displayed underneath the player's score.


While riding down the street, PAPERBOY must avoid collisions with all stationary objects and other characters moving about the neighborhood. To avoid collisions, PAPERBOY can ride his bike anywhere - on the sidewalk, in the street, or into front yards. A collision with anything results in the loss of a life.


The large cast of colorful characters make it increasingly more difficult for PAPERBOY to make his way down the street. Eventually, the player must develop great skill in maneuvering PAPERBOY to avoid street traffic, dogs, cats, various pedestrians, etc. In addition, many of the houses have certain characters associated with them. Non-subscribers are hostile to PAPERBOY and will attack him and try to knock him down. If you damage a subscriber's property, that character may also attack. So the more customers you lose, the more hostile the neighborhood gets toward PAPERBOY, and the tougher it becomes to avoid all the characters that are out to get PAPERBOY.


At the end of each delivery day, you have a chance to sharpen your skills by guiding PAPERBOY through the PAPERBOY Training Grounds. This obstacle course is filled with various targets at which to throw and jumps to make. You can't lose lives in this bonus round - any collision just ends the training course segment, after which you move on to the next delivery day. You must move fast through this course and try to cross the finish line before the time at the top of the screen runs out.


At the start of each day, a map of your route is displayed to indicate subscriber and non-subscriber houses. This map is helpful in reminding you of what customers you may have lost on the previous day and the location of your remaining customers.


Select a Street. At the start of each game, you will be presented with a chance to choose your paper route - Easy Street, Middle Road, or Hard Way. Each of these streets has distinctly different house designs and character appearance. Also, each street differs in its aggressiveness (scores are doubled on Middle Road, tripled on Hard Way) and has a unique training course at the end of each day.


You will find that the different streets require different skill levels. One may call for a good deal of throwing accuracy, another lots of tricky maneuvering, and the third a combination of all skills. It's really three games in one.

- TRIVIA -


Released in December 1984.


On Monday, June 30, 1986; Mr. Mark Caesar and Mr. Robin Hallingstad filed a suit against Atari Games Corp. for $1 million plus profits alleging that the company stole the idea for a video game that was marketed by the name of PAPERBOY. The boys had submitted to Atari a detailed proposal for a similar game in July 1983.


After a score of 10,000,000 or more is achieved, the initial in the top 10 ranking merges with the score to produce a truly impressive score display. For example, if you had top score at 10,000,000, this would appear as '110,000,000'.


The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including PAPERBOY.


Phil Britt holds the official record for this game ('Grand Slam' score of all three streets combined) with 1,136,435 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


1) Be careful not to move too slowly - swarms of bees or nasty whirlwinds may come to push you along.

2) Develop skill in maneuvering in and out of tight situations using the handlebar control.

3) Build up your Breakage Bonus by riding over flowers in non-subscribers' yards.

4) Some players prefer to lose many of their customers so they can do more 'trashing'. Others like to try for Perfect Deliveries. See which strategy scores highest for you.

5) Try hitting characters with papers - you might be pleased with the results!

6) Dirt piles in the streets can be used for making jumps, which will also score points

Parodius Da! - Shinwa kara Owarai e (c) 04/1990 Konami.


Created as a parody of Konami's own superb and challenging "Gradius" series of shoot-em-ups, Parodius Da! acquired its own identity and would spawn sequels of its own. It maintained the same intuitive power-up system of "Nemesis", "Salamander" et. al. but adopted a graphical style that was entirely its own; something that becomes evident at the very start of the game when players can chose to pilot either a penguin or an octopus rather that the traditional Gradius ship. Parodius' eccentricity and unique humour is further demonstrated soon after the game begins; as players face such enemies as a giant belly-dancing woman and a half-cat/half-boat creature.

- TRIVIA -


The title of this game is a combination of two words : Parody + "Gradius" = Parodius. The subtitle of this game translates from Japanese as 'From Myth to Joke', which is a homage to the "Gradius III" subtitle : 'From Legend to Myth'.


During the game's attract mode, potential players are presented with a short history tour of the Nemesis series, as the title screen of each of Parodius's prequels are introduced'; watched, in typical Parodius style, by a crowd of blue and pink penguins.


Pentarou is from the MSX game "Antarctic Adventure".

The second boss (Patrotic Eagle) is similar to the first boss of "Gradius 2" (phoenix). This boss is often coined as a reason why Parodius was never released in the U.S.

The Vegas dancer near the end of the second stage is similar to the robot spider near the end of "Gradius 2". She appears in other Parodius games as well.


Stage 1 crucial part music is a remix of 'Symphony No.9 4th Movement', by Beethoven.

Stage 1 boss music is a remix of 'The Flight of the Bumble Bee', by R. Korsakov.

Stage 2-1 music is a remix of 'Op.71a the Nutcracker', by P. Tchaikovsky.

Pengo (c) 1982 Sega.


Pengo the Penguin is the eponymous star of Pengo the video game. The basic layout of Pengo is akin to that of Namco's legendary 'Pac-Man'; featuring, as it does, a top down, single screen, maze-like arrangement. Pengo's enemies, the Sno-Bees, are also similar to the Blinky, Inky, Clyde etc. - the ghosts that pursued Pac-man; not least because Sno-bees also come in 4 different varieties, each represented by a different colour.


One aspect that distinguishes Pengo from the Namco classic is that the Maze itself is a wholly interactive environment. Each section of wall is represented as a block of ice, which can be pushed onto the Sno-bees to destroy them. The Sno-bees themselves will destroy the ice blocks as they move around each level, so speed is of the essence. Some of the blocks are 'Diamond blocks' which cannot be destroyed, and can be re-used by Pengo.


The outer wall of each level can also be utilized; if the player pushes against the wall when a Sno-bee is next to it, The Sno-bee will be temporarily stunned; allowing Pengo to move in for the kill.

Rodney Day holds the official record for this game with 1,110,370 points.


A bootleg of this game is known as "Penta".

- SCORING -


Vibrating a wall : 30 points. 

Smashing an ice block : 30 points. 

Smashing an ice block with a Sno-bee inside : 500 points. 

Walking over a stunned Snow-bee : 100 points. 

Killing a Snow-bee with an ice block : 400 points.

Killing three Snow-bees at once with one ice block : 3,200 points. 

Killing four Snow-bees at once with one ice block : 6,400 points. 

Lining up the three diamond blocks with none of them touching a wall : 10,000 points. 

Lining up the three diamond blocks with one or more touching a wall : 5,000 points. 

Completing screen in under 20 seconds : 5,000 bonus points. 

Completing screen in 20-29 seconds : 2,000 bonus points.

Completing screen in 40-49 seconds : 500 bonus points. 

Completing screen in 50-59 seconds : 10 bonus points. 

Completing screen in 60 seconds and over : no bonus points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* The last remaining Sno-bee on the screen will try to escape. If you do not kill it before it reaches one of the corners it will disappear.


* The indicator at the top of the screen tells you how many Sno-Bees are remaining on the level, including those still in ice blocks.


* At the start of each level some ice blocks will flash. This indicates that there is a Sno-Bee inside and you can destroy the ice block to kill the Sno-Bee before it emerges.


* When you kill the last Sno-bee you have a couple of seconds before the level ends. Use this time to crush an ice block for an extra 30 points.


* Concentrate your efforts on lining up the diamond blocks. The 10,000 points are the biggest single score in the game, and stunning all the Sno-bees is also a valuable side effect. You can then kill them easily by pushing ice blocks onto them rather than running over them (400 points as opposed to 100).


* Try to kill more than one Sno-bee at a time, as 2 or more together are worth more points than killing them individually.


* Easter Egg : Into attract mode, push the two joys to up, press the two action buttons and one button of start game, and it will show the credits of the game. After a few seconds, the game will reset. The wait can be stopped pushing the Start 1 button.

Peter Pack-Rat (c) 1984 Atari Games.


Peter Pack Rat is a platform game in which the player, controlling the game's hero, a rat called Peter; must rush around a platform-filled screen collecting a variety of objects to take back to Peter's nest. These objects include bottles, watches, hats, balls, and cans.


A number of enemy creatures hinder the player's progress; these include rats, cats, dogs, bats and owls. There are 3 different levels to play through; a junkyard, a sewer and a tree.


As well as the objects that must be collected and taken to Peter's nest, additional objects can also be collected and thrown to stun attacking animals. Flying animals that have been stunned can be ridden around the screen for a short period of time. A round ends when all the desired objects have been collected and placed in the nest. Successive rounds add more objects and enemies, as well as changing the patterns of the shortcuts.

- TRIVIA -


Although only 500 Peter Pack Rat units were produced from the factory, many arcade owners purchased the conversion kit which was marketed and readily available from Atari at a lower price than a new system. An Atari System 1 cabinet could be converted into a different game (only other Atari System 1 games) in a day.


Peter Pack Rat, as with all the Atari System 1 games, was a very distracting game in the arcade. It would constantly play the background music when no one was playing it. The Atari System 1 speaker system had a great acoustic arrangement. Players would be immersed in a sea of sound allowing them to really get into the game play. Unfortunately for others, they could hear the same thing on the other side of the room!


Many arcade owners, not wanting to mess with accessing the setup menu of the game, would just unplug the cabinet after receiving numerous noise complaints. The game wasn't much of a money-maker so it probably saved money in energy costs by being off.


Peter Pack Rat had a rather unique control panel configuration. Throw buttons were on both the left and right sides of the joystick and could be used interchangeably. They also doubled as the 1 Start and 2 Start buttons. The joystick was an 8-way handle with a small button on top which was the jump button. The joystick was notorious for breaking. To make matters worse, Atari didn't make it easy to get repair parts for it and charged a great deal for them. Peter Pack Rat was down quite often.


In all scenes there are placeholders for the shiny objects Peter must collect. Some of these placeholders do not match the object that goes in them. It is surmised that Atari may have thought some of the objects were inappropriate and changed them at the last minute. The Atari developers did not have enough time to rewrite the background code before the game went into production. If you look closely you can make out a pack of cigarettes, a lighter and a stop sign. There are other mismatches but the placeholders are too generic-looking to identify the original object.


Jeff Peters holds the official record for this game with 910,875 points. Note : Jeff Peters may hold the official record but the world's best Peter Pack Rat player is Curtis Sneddon. He has achieved a score of over 1,600,000 points and played the arcade version until it crashes at level 58. The level before it crashes has no enemies and the levels leading up to that point have fewer and fewer enemies making the final levels of the game extremely easy. The last level ends with Peter Pack Rat's normal victory dance then the game resets to the introduction screen.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (That's Atari Music : G.S.M. Atari Games 1 - PCCB-00066) on 21/07/1991.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Don't forget you have an 8-way joystick. Make use of it. If an enemy is at any 45 degree angle and in your way, shoot it! Use this when trying to get objects in the spider's web. Often the spider will attack at an angle.


* Many people don't realize that Peter can swim. After all, you are a rat and a rats can swim.


* When you are in the water you can stun and ride the alligator. If you do manage to agitate the alligator and he starts chomping at you in the air, don't worry about it. He can never get you that way. Only when you are in the water or drop directly into his mouth.


* Gravity can be your friend when dropped from a flying creature. If you get knocked loose or if your flying buddy is about to let you go, THROW AN OBJECT DOWNWARD IMMEDIATELY. There is a very good chance you will hit another attacking flying creature and now, you dropped on it and it's carrying you! This is particularly effective with owls in the tree scene.


* Don't let the slick surfaces in the sewer intimidate you. You can still jump left and right when on top of them. This is advantageous when trying to avoid the alligator, the spider and other enemies that may be right on your tail.


* When jumping left, right or falling, pushing up on the joystick when Peter is right over a ladder will make him grab onto it. This is useful in avoiding enemies that are right below you and off the screen.


* In higher levels (known as 'waves' in this game), Peter gets stronger and can jump farther and higher. Use this new "super jump" ability to jump straight up to levels above him, to quickly avoid the attacking creatures and move farther left and right across the screen. This ability is extremely advantageous in the tree scene. Peter can jump clear across from one side of the tree to the other.

Phoenix (c) 1980 Amstar.


PHOENIX is an exciting new space game, with special audio and visual effects, challenging the skills of the most experienced player. Fascinating visual graphics and extraterrestrial sounds add to the intensity of this game.


There are 5 basic stages to-each round of play. After a melodious introduction, the first stage begins with a wave of 16 small Phoenixes attacking the spaceship. They drop missiles and dive at the spaceship, in an effort to destroy it.


The spaceship maneuvers left and right, evading the missiles and birds, and fires rockets, attempting to destroy the birds.


The spaceship can utilize the 'Force Field' as a means of protection from the missiles and birds, and can destroy the Phoenixes by colliding with them while in the Force Field. The Force Field only lasts a few seconds and then cannot be used for approximately 5 seconds afterward.


After the first wave of Phoenixes is destroyed, a second wave appears, and can be destroyed in the same manner as in the first stage.


The 3rd stage begins with a wave of eight Eggs that are transformed into blue Phoenix birds that attack the spaceship. These birds can be destroyed by rocket fire from the spaceship. If the rocket hits the bird on center, the bird is destroyed. If the rocket hits the bird to the left or right of center, only that wing of the bird is destroyed. The wing will regenerate itself in a short time.


After all the blue Phoenixes have been shot down, the fourth stage appears on the screen. Two banks of eggs appear (four eggs in each row), and are transformed into pink Phoenixes, and can be destroyed in the same manner as the blue birds.


The 5th stage is the attack of the spacefortress, which sends down waves of small birds to attack the spaceship, in addition to direct missile fire from the spacefortress. Spaceship rocket fire can penetrate and break down the protective barrier shielding the space creature in the spacefortress. The fifth stage is completed when the rocket from the spaceship destroys the space creature and the spacefortress with a direct hit.


- TECHNICAL -


Most Phoenix games will be in a standard Centuri woodgrain cabinet, but several other cabinets exist, due to this game being sold by multiple companies at the same time. These use sticker sideart (which covers the upper half of the machine), and glass marquees. The control panel is made up entirely of buttons, no joysticks are present. The monitor in this machine is mounted vertically, and the monitor bezel is relatively unadorned. Phoenix uses a unique wiring harness, which isn't know to be compatible with any other games.

Released in December 1980.


Phoenix was the first multi-level space shooter and also the first shooter to include bosses. Despite its hardware issues, Phoenix's many gameplay innovations ensured that it now is rightly regarded as a classic and, along with Taito's "Space Invaders" and Namco's "Pac-Man" shares the dubious honour of being one of the most cloned games of the 1980s; with numerous console and home computer 'tributes' appearing.


Mark Gotfraind holds the official record for this game with 987,620 points.

- SCORING -


Scoring is a little complicated in this game due to the fact it depends on hits made and how close the Phoenix's are to your fighter.


Phoenix fighters : 20, 40, or 80 points; 200 points if flying as a bird.

Phoenix birds : 50 or 100 points/egg, 100 - 800 points/bird (depends on how many wings shot off and distance from fighter).

Spacefortress : 800 - 9200 points (depends on the amount of damage to the spaceship, speedof destruction, as well as the number of spaceships destroyed). Usually, first 9 spaceships would increase by a thousand, then will be followed by nine 9000 point spaceships, then back to the first nine set, etc...


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your fighter will be in the middle at the bottom of the screen. You will see a formation of enemy fighters at the top of the screen. This is the beginning of wave 1. A quick note about the shield. It lasts a couple of seconds and takes about five seconds to regenerate again.


WAVES 1 AND 2 :

1) You will usually be attacked by multiple fighters at any one time. The movements of these fighters is pretty random.

2) In addition to dropping bombs on your fighter, Phoenix fighters also tend to try to ram your fighter.

3) After you clear out a few fighters, they will reassemble at the top of the screen. They will then move in synch with each other as they creep to the bottom of the screen.

4) Sometimes a Phoenix fighter will hover right above your ship. If you're quick, you can get off a quick shot and move away before a bomb can be dropped on you.

5) If multiple Phoenix fighters are at your level, use the shield to clear a path through them.


WAVE 3 AND 4 :

1) The Phoenixes in wave 3 enter the screen in a zig-zag pattern while the Phoenixes in wave 4 arrive in a cross-over pattern of four Phoenixes per side.

2) Once they get large, they start to do erratic zig-zag patterns across the screen. At the same time, they are dropping bombs toward your fighter. Your goal is to shoot off their wings.  If you do this, it forces them to go straight down until the wing regenerates. They will still be dropping bombs, but at least they will be going straight down.

3) If at all possible, try to hit the Phoenixes when they are close to your ship. Doing this gets you more points.

4) In addition, try to shoot off both wings before destroying a Phoenix for more points.


WAVE 5 :

1) Your goal on this wave is to cut through the hull and shield and take out the alien inside.

2) Start firing as rapidly as you can to quickly cut through the hull. It will take quite a few shots to get to the shield.

3) The shield rotates so you will have to hit it a lot of times in order to get a wide enough hole in it to hit the alien.

4) As all of this is going on, the Spacefortress is continually descending upon your ship. In addition, the escorts are constantly harassing you.

5) A good strategy is that once you have cut a path through the hull and shield, wait for the Spacefortress to be almost on top of your ship. When you take out the alien, you will get a lot more points.

6) Destroying the escorts does not end this wave. Once you complete wave 5, the cycle begins anew.


* During the game three birds will attack all in a line. Let those birds fly all the way to the bottom and start to fly back up. As they are flying up, shoot all three in a row real quick (2 or 3 seconds) and you score will elevates your score to 204,000 regardless of what your current score is - The best way to get this bonus for shooting the three birds in a line is on the second stage of level 2. The blue and pink birds in an oval shape. Just wait, not firing at the bottom of the screen. A single bird will come down, fanny around and then fly back up, then 4 birds will fly down together in a line. When they start to fly back up - blast three of them for the bonus. It works best here because of the rapid fire allowed on this and every other 2nd stage. In addition, accomplishing the trick a second time again puts your score at 204,000, even if your score was higher.

Phozon (c) 08/1983 Namco.


An unusual puzzle/arcade hybrid from Namco in which the player controls a black molecule with four red spikes. The idea is for the player to align other floating molecules onto their own molecule to create an increasingly complex pattern; this must match the "blue print" molecule that is situated in the middle of the screen. To make molecules adhere to the player's molecule, the player simply touches the target molecule with their own. If a molecule attaches in a place that does not fit the pattern shown in the middle of the screen, the player must press the reject button to make if float away. Groups of multi-coloured rotating spheres move around the screen and must be avoided.

- SCORING -


Shooting a yellow ship on stage 1 : 80 points.

Shooting a blue ship on stage 1 : 80 points.

Shooting a falling blue ship on stage 1 : 100 - 800 points.

Shooting a bird dead center on stage 2:  100 points.

Shooting a bird's wing on stage 2 : 20 points.

Docking the ship on stage 3 : points awarded for remaining fuel.

Shooting the falling ships on stage 4 : 100 points.

Destroying the mother-ship : 800 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* On stage 1, you can ignore as many yellow ships as possible, and only aim for the blue ones. When the yellow ones move off screen there is often a chance that the next wave will include a blue ship. Since the blue ships are worth more points they are worth waiting for.


* On stage 2 the birds do not fire until they are fully developed. You can usually take out 3 or 4 of them before they start firing.


* On stage 2 you can concentrate on continual fire on birds wings when there are only 2 or 3 remaining, as this awards 20 points per hit and does not destroy the bird. You can rack up a good score by doing this, but watch out for the falling bullets.


* The asteroids positioning on the docking stage is totally random, so this stage is often down to chance. Do not use your thrusters to maximize your bonus points.


* On stage 4, the ships which come down from the cloud move across you from left to right and back again. You can time your firing so that they are hit when directly above you. Note that only the mother-ship fires at you so you can take out the ships when not directly below the cloud, and be safe in the knowledge that you have no bullets to avoid.

Pit-Fighter (c) 1990 Atari Games.


Three digitized brawlers face off co-operatively against a variety of street thugs, with gameplay featuring crowd interference and usable weapons. Players also get to fight each other in a 'Grudge Match'. Pit-Fighter featured impressive camera zoom and side-to-side pan but was somewhat flawed as a gameplay experience. On the dedicated cabinet version, up to three players can play simultaneously.

Released in September 1990. This was the first ever beat-em-up to feature fully digitized protagonists - released two years before Midway's Mortal Kombat.


Pit Fighter was available in both dedicated cabinets and as conversion kits. The converted versions were usually only housed in two-player cabinets, while the dedicated machine supported up to three players. The dedicated versions had 25'' arcade monitors but, due to the lack of commercial and critical success, many of these machines were turned into "Street Fighter 2 - The World Warriors" before they were even a year old.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (That's Atari Music : G.S.M. Atari Games 1 - PCCB-00066) on 21/07/1991.

- TRIVIA -


Reprogrammed and released by Sega in 1985, this arcade game is based on two games (Pitfall! and Pitfall! 2) originally created and designed by David Crane for Activision on the Atari 2600. David Crane was one of the most highly awarded video game designers in the world. David Crane was also one of the founders of Activision in 1979 (the first ever software house which developed games for third party hardware).


An official Pitfall! game-board based on the video game was released in 1983 by MB (Milton Bradley), licensed from Activision.


The 'Pitfall' series also spawned a cartoon series : Ruby-Spears Productions. Produced By Joe Ruby, Ken Spears. Originally aired September 17, 1983 as part of 'Saturday Supercade' on CBS.

Pleiads (c) 1981 Tehkan.


Pleiads is a 2-D, space shooter style game. With its many interesting visual and audio effects, this game is sure to challenge the most avid player.


Each round of play includes 4 different stages. With the onset of the melodious background tune, the first stage of play begins.


Against a backdrop of planets and twinkling stars, the Earth City must be protected from sixteen attacking Martians. These Martian attackers have the ability to transform from flying Martians, to walking Martians, or to UFOs. The walking Martians build barriers across the Earth City. These barriers must be destroyed.


The Earth Spaceship can be maneuvered right and left. With the use of the 'warp' button, it can be randomly relocated when necessary. These, plus a backup of stationary defense weapons, aid in protecting the Earth City and Spaceship, as well as in destroying the Martian Attackers. When all but the two final Martians have been destroyed, a tone of dusk shades the Earth City. As these two attackers meet their end, the Earth Spaceship ascends into space to meet the challenge of Stage II.


In this second stage of play, the Earth Spaceship encounters eight Space Monsters. To destroy these Monsters, they must be hit in the direct center. When a Space Monster with burning wings is destroyed, up to 400 points can be added to your score. When all the Space Monsters have been destroyed, the Earth Spaceship prepares for Stage III.


In this third stage of play, the Earth Spaceship is confronted with the Martian Space Battleship and its unseen forces. This Martian Battleship contains five closed chambers, each protected by a rocket flame. Each chamber opens periodically at random, to release a defending reserve of Martian attackers. When a flame below an open chamber is extinguished, point value of the Martian Space Battleship increases. This enemy ship can be destroyed by either eliminating all sixteen Martian attackers, or by extinguishing all five rocket flames. When the Martian Space Battleship finally explodes, the Earth Spaceship moves on to Stage IV.


This last stage of play begins with an emergency signal, SOS, SOS, SOS, AT ONCE RETURN TO EARTH. The Earth Spaceship is now ready to be guided on its journey, through a landing corridor, back to its home base. The Earth Spaceship must be carefully maneuvered around other spaceships in order to avoid destruction. Clearing flags will add bonus points to your score. When the Earth Spaceship has been safely maneuvered to its arrival target, 500 to 4,000 points will be added to your score, while bursts of fireworks greet your arrival and signal the beginning of a new round of play.

- TRIVIA -


Released in April 1981.


Pleiades was a partnership game between Tehkan and Centuri (US manufacture and distribution (July 1981). Centuri tended to partner up with other companies such as SNK for "Vanguard" or Amstar for "Phoenix". Tehkan was a little known company who mostly produced sports type games. There most well known game is "Bomb Jack". Unfortunately, the video game crash of the early 80's claimed both of these companies as victims; Centuri in 1983 and Tehkan in 1985. This was another game that one played on multiple playing fields. The scoring system was more unique in the fact it depended on things you did before you killed an enemy. Pleiads was a loosely based sequel to "Phoenix", which was released in 1980.


The cabinet artwork spells the name as 'Pleiades' but the game has it spelled 'Pleiads'. The name itself is from Greek mythology, of which there are several different spellings (Pleiads, Pleiades, Peleiades).


Patrick Orr holds the official record for this game with 1,164,900 points.


A Pleiads unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High'.


Pleiads also shows up in 'Chapter Two - The Bishop of Battle', the 2nd story in the 1983 movie Nightmares, featuring Emelio Estevez and Moon Unit Zappa.  However, they use game sounds from other games ("Dig Dug", among others) during the game footage.


- SCORING -


Scoring is a little complicated in this game due to the fact it depends on hits made on the Martians in the later waves.

Flying Martian : 30 points (Last one of the wave is 130 points)

Walking Martian : 80 points

UFO : 150 points


Space Monster (small) just entering screen : 50 points

Space Monster (large) after entering screen : 100 points

Space Monster with one wing burning : 200 points

Space Monster with two wings burning : 400 points

Each hit on a Space Monster's wing : 20 points


The Martian Space Battleship has a different scoring system. It is dependent on how many exhaust flames you put out with laser fire. The chamber must be open for you to put out the fire. The scoring starts low on the first cycle of four waves and increments up from that point. Your sixth visit to the Martian Space Battleship has the potential to yield the most points. This is how the Martian Space Battleship is scored :

Cycle : 1 - Fires Out : 1 - 100 Points

Cycle : 1 - Fires Out : 2 - 200 Points

Cycle : 1 - Fires Out : 3 - 400 Points

Cycle : 1 - Fires Out : 4 - 800 Points

Cycle : 1 - Fires Out : 5 - 1600 Points

Cycle : 2 - Fires Out : 1 - 200 Points

Cycle : 2 - Fires Out : 2 - 400 Points

Cycle : 2 - Fires Out : 3 - 800 Points

Cycle : 2 - Fires Out : 4 - 1600 Points

Cycle : 2 - Fires Out : 5 - 3200 Points

Cycle : 3 - Fires Out : 1 - 300 Points

Cycle : 3 - Fires Out : 2 - 600 Points

Cycle : 3 - Fires Out : 3 - 1200 Points

Cycle : 3 - Fires Out : 4 - 2400 Points

Cycle : 3 - Fires Out : 5 - 4800 Points

Cycle : 4 - Fires Out : 1 - 400 Points

Cycle : 4 - Fires Out : 2 - 800 Points

Cycle : 4 - Fires Out : 3 - 1600 Points

Cycle : 4 - Fires Out : 4 - 3200 Points

Cycle : 4 - Fires Out : 5 - 6400 Points

Cycle : 5 - Fires Out : 1 - 500 Points

Cycle : 5 - Fires Out : 2 - 1000 Points

Cycle : 5 - Fires Out : 3 - 2000 Points

Cycle : 5 - Fires Out : 4 - 4000 Points

Cycle : 5 - Fires Out : 5 - 8000 Points

Cycle : 6 - Fires Out : 1 - 600 Points

Cycle : 6 - Fires Out : 2 - 1200 Points

Cycle : 6 - Fires Out : 3 - 2400 Points

Cycle : 6 - Fires Out : 4 - 4800 Points

Cycle : 6 - Fires Out : 5 - 9600 Points


Every cycle after the sixth gives the same amount of points as the fifth cycle.


During the landing sequence in wave 4, you get points for the following :

Collecting flags : 100- 600 points

Successful landing : 500-4000 points plus a fireworks display per 500 points awarded (i.e. 1500 points yields three fireworks bursts).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your fighter will be in the middle at the bottom of the screen. You will see a city on either side at the corner, two radar dishes to your left, and some fighters and missiles to your right. This is the beginning of wave 1.


WAVE 1

1) There are three types of units you need to be aware of and what they do :

a) Flying Martians fly in a zig-zag pattern and drop bombs along their route. The bombs are pretty easy to avoid.

b) Walking Martians lay barriers across your field of fire. The Martians can shoot through the barriers but you must destroy them to be able to shoot the Martians. The barriers themselves are worth no points.

c) UFO's rarely fire at your fighter. Instead, they attempt to ram and destroy your fighter. They move in a quicker zig-zag type pattern.

2) The two radar dishes are very helpful so you need to protect them. They not only warn of a new wave of Martians, but they also take pot shots at the Martians. If they score a hit, you get credited with the points.

3) Other items on the screen serve as cover for your fighter.

4) Once you are down to the last two fighters, be ready because they tend to do more chaotic moves to avoid getting hit while dropping bombs at the same time.


WAVE 2

1) The Space Monsters all start small. They come from the top doing a lazy zig-zag pattern. It is a good idea to try to take out at least four of them.

2) Once they get large, they start to do erratic zig-zag patterns across the screen. At the same time, they are dropping bombs toward your fighter. Your goal is to flame one of their wings. If you do this, it forces them to go straight down until the wing fire is put out. They will still be dropping bombs, but at least they will be going straight down.

3) If at all possible, try to flame both wings of each of the Space Monsters remaining before destroying them.  You get a lot more points for it.

4) One trick some players do is to go all the way to the left corner on the remaining Space Monster. It lines up in such a way that the bombs miss your fighter. Then you just keep hitting the fire button, which results in you constantly hitting the wing (20 points a hit). Some players rack up a couple of thousand points before the Space Monster is coming down too fast for them to hit.


WAVE 3

1) Your goal on this wave is to extinguish the five exhaust flames under the Martian Space Battleship.  You can only extinguish a flame when the chamber door is open. They open and close at random times but if you are trying to put out the fifth flame, it will open and close quickly.

2) Try to remain under the battleship as much as possible so you can quickly extinguish the flame. Sometimes the door opens and closes quickly.

3) The only points you will get for the Martian Space Battleship will be from the number of flames you put out. This wave is your biggest point getter (and easier) in the game.

4) If you destroy all 16 of the escorts before you put out all the flames on the battleship, then the wave is over and you get whatever points the battleship was worth.

5) Conversely, if you destroy the battleship before you destroy the 16 escorts, the wave also ends with you getting full points for the battleship. The points being dependent on the cycle you are on.

6) This time, you are only attacked by the Flying Martians and UFO's. They will either come in from the sides by the battleship or they will exit one of the chambers above the flame (or where the flame used to be). Again, the Flying Martians will drop a volley of bombs while the UFO's will just try to ram your fighter.


WAVE 4

1) When you first approach the airstrip, take a quick look around it to see where the other fighters are parked and where the flags are located at. In the later levels, the spacing becomes very tight so you will need precision movements to navigate around.

2) Your fighter will be constantly moving so you will need to adjust it left or right constantly or it will drift in whatever its last direction was.

3) If you have a chance to get a flag, and it doesn't put you into a bad situation movement-wise, then get it. If not, just concentrate on getting to the target.

4) Your main goal is to get into the target dead center to get the maximum points for landing.

Once you complete wave 4, the cycle begins anew.

Also licensed to Leprechaun.


The graphics were developed by Akira Yasuda (aka Akiman, who soon became one of the most beloved Capcom artists) for the game "Mahjong Gakuen". He also helped develop the 'interaction' that happened in the bridge scenes, where by pressing a certain button you did kinky 'things' to the naked gals on the screen. Indeed, the effort put into "Mahjong Gakuen" could not be wasted for a Japanese release only, so Capcom developed "Poker Ladies" for worldwide release, changing the theme from Mahjong to Poker and marketing it under the 'Mitchell' name.


The 'interaction' feature would be used to better and more explicit effect in "Lady Killer", as well as in the bonus rounds in "Gals Panic S" and "Gals Panic S2".

Leprechaun's Poker Ladies version has some differences :

* 3 hands instead of 4.

Pole Position [Upright model] (c) 1982 Namco.


Pole Position is a 1-player game using a color raster-scan video display. The game action takes place at Fuji Speedway in Japan. The country around the speedway consists of green meadows, hills, and snow-capped Mt. Fuji.


The player drives a Formula-1 race car on the Fuji Speedway. The object of the game is to finish the qualifying lap as quickly as possible. If the player beats the clock, he qualifies for the Grand Prix at Fuji Speedway; if not, he drives out the remainder of his time along the qualifying course.


As a qualifier, the driver is ranked according to his qualifying lap time, from position one (the pole position) to position eight. The player then races against the clock and other cars to finish the specified number of laps ('Nr. of Laps' dip switch setting; 3 laps is the default) of the race as fast as possible and to achieve the highest score possible. The player earns points for passing cars, driving on the track, and finishing the race with time remaining. He is rewarded with an extended-play lap for completing the first lap within a certain amount of time (depending on the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting).


The game starts with the player's car behind the starting line and a certain amount of time, in seconds, on the clock ('Game Time' dip switch setting; the default is 90 seconds). The car must finish the qualifying lap within a certain amount of time (which varies depending on the 'Practice Rank' dip switch setting) to be in the race. If the player does not qualify, his car continues on the track until the time is used up.


The starting lights flash from red to green, and the race begins. Racing hazards are other racing cars, sharp turns, road signs, and water puddles. (All of these hazards are also present on the qualifying lap with the exception of water puddles.) As the race progresses, more cars appear on the track. If the driver's car hits another car or a road sign, the driver's car is destroyed in an explosion. The driver's car reappears in a few seconds and the race continues. Driving through water puddles or off the track slows down the driver's car.


Racing into the first turn, the driver must let up on the accelerator slightly to make the corner. Road signs flash along the side of the track. Depending on how well the player manipulates the controls, he can either roar through the hairpin turns like a champion or spin out in a flaming crash. He jockeys for position with the other racers, while keeping his eye on the clock at the top of the screen. When his time runs out, the race is over.


The top score achieved by a player appears at the top of the screen. The time allotted for the lap is displayed under the top score. Increasing lap time (in seconds and hundredths of a second) and the speed of the car appears last.

Pole Position [Upright model] came in a standard Atari cabinet (similar to the "Asteroids"/"Lunar Lander" cabinet), with an altered control panel area. The sideart consisted of red, white, blue, and grey striped paint job, with an Atari logo, and a square sticker showing a race scene. While the marquee had a Pole Position logo superimposed over a view of several race cars coming directly for you. The control panel was done up in the same colors as the side, and featured an analog steering wheel, and a 2-position shifter.

Released in September 1982.


Also released as "Pole Position [Cockpit model]".


Also licensed to Atari for US manufacture and distribution (November 1982). Approximately 20,400 units were produced by Atari (~17,250 Uprights and ~3,150 Cockpits).


This game was one of the choices presented to Bally/Midway from Namco for sub-licensing. Bally/Midway chose "Mappy" while Atari was left with Pole Position. Pole Position went on to become the biggest game of 1983


When Pole Position was introduced in 1982, players lined up in arcades around the world to grip the steering wheel and stomp on the gas pedal of a driving game so realistic that the players -- just like their cars -- were swerving around the corners. Pole Position was a 14-carat contribution to the golden age of video games. Pole Position started the trend for photo-realism in video game graphics. In addition to great graphics, it had great game play and it was a huge success, dominated game charts for almost about 2 years.

This was the first driving game to be based on a real circuit : The action takes place at Fuji Speedway in Japan. The snow-capped Mt. Fuji appears in the background.


* A place in video game history : "Pole Position stands out as the racing game that really appealed to the general public," said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "It went into arcades across the nation, where it can still be found. Pole Position machines were placed everywhere -- even in gas stations!". The popularity of Pole Position was based on its realism. Players felt as if they were actually in the driver's seat. "Racing games before Pole Position tended to have a top-down perspective in which you floated over the course, which wasn't terribly realistic," Lindsey said. "Pole Position's eye-level point of view gave it a great deal of realism, and this point of view became a standard for racing games that followed. In addition, it provided a lot of peripheral cues. You saw lots of things zipping by on the side of the screen and this really added to the excitement of the game. Pole Position also had great sound. You could hear the gears winding out in the stretches. As you zipped by another car, you could hear that car's engine. All of these details added to the overall effect. Pole Position was, and still is, an awfully nice game.".


* The great 25-cent escape : Chris Lindsey believes that a big reason why Pole Position has remained such a timeless classic is that it has always appealed to women, in addition to men. "I think there are quite a few game developers who would like to figure out why some games appeal to females," Lindsey said. "Perhaps this is just pop psychology, but I've seen two types of games women will take to : racing games, and games in which the character, or your representation on screen, is doing something besides destroying bad guys. I don't know if that's the correct way to describe it, but that is what I've seen. I've had occasion to work in different types of entertainment facilities, large and small, very modern and, of course, the museum. Without fail I see women take to "Pac-Man", and I see them take to racing games, almost regardless of what the racing game is.".

Lindsey said the comparative lack of violence in Pole Position and other racing games might explain their popularity with women -- as well as with men. "I think violence in games is fairly thoughtless for men, and for some women, the violence in a video game may stick out," Lindsey said. "Violence in gaming is not an experience that most people seek even though they like video games. When those people find games that are engaging, and that offer outstanding game play, there is a desire on their part to dive into it. These racing games really offer that.".


* Namco notes : The engineers who created Pole Position knew they had created something special when a steering wheel was first connected to the prototype game in their lab. Later, when Pole Position was released, engineers visiting the arcades found that the waiting lines were so long that they curled back and forth within the arcade and then extended out the door.


Pole Position is widely cursed by collectors as having the worst hardware design of any arcade game released in the 1980s. Internal documents that have recently surfaced bear this fact out. The circuit board underwent a large number of modifications and design changes that, while finally allowing the game to function, made the boards fragile. Proof can be found by the piles of Pole Position video PCBs with burnt edge connectors sitting on collectors' workbenches :). Working replacement Pole Position PCBs are very hard to find these days, and almost all of the known repair shops won't even look at them, much less attempt to fix them.


Les Lagier holds the official record for this game with 67,310 points.


A bootleg of this game is known as "Top Racer".


A Pole Position unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.


A Pole Position upright cabinet appears in the Judas Priest music video 'Freewheel Burning'. The gameplay shows the head of Rob Halford (lead singer) in the player's car :)


Parkers Brothers released a boardgame based on this videogame (same name) : Players put various movement cards (move 5, move 4, move rookie/move 2, move 2/shift track) in an attempt to be the first car around the track.


- UPDATES -


Differences between the Namco and the Atari version :

* The Atari version has an extra dip switch setting ('Speed Unit') that allows the user to toggle between using the English system and the Metric system to measure the distance of one lap around the track (as shown on the title screen) and the speed of the player's car (as shown on the upper-right corner of the screen during game play). By default, the game uses the Metric system. Namco's original version does not have this dip and exclusively uses the Metric system.

* On the title screen, the distance of one complete lap around the track is displayed. Namco's original version gives this distance in meters ('1LAP 4359M'). In Atari's version, if the 'Speed Unit' dip is set to 'km/h', the distance is expressed in kilometers and thousandths of a kilometer (1 LAP 4.359 km); if it is set to "mph" the distance is expressed in miles and thousandths of a mile (1LAP 2.709mi.').

* At the start of the game, a Goodyear blimp carries the white banner across the screen in the Namco version while a blimp with the word 'Atari' carries the white banner across the screen in the Atari version.

* If the player qualifies for the race in the Atari version, the white banner's message reads 'PREPARE TO RACE' while the voice can be heard saying, 'Nice driving--you've qualified for the race!'


- SCORING -


Points are scored for every foot of track driven.

At the end of the game, 50 points are scored for each car the driver passed.

Finishing the game awards 200 points for each second left on the timer.


Qualifying Lap Placement Bonus (Qualifying times listed below assume the 'Practice Rank' dip is at its default setting) :

58.50 (1st place) : 4000 points

60.00 (2nd place) : 2000 points

62.00 (3rd place) : 1400 points

64.00 (4th place) : 1000 points

66.00 (5th place) : 800 points

68.00 (6th place) : 600 points

70.00 (7th place) : 400 points

73.00 (8th place) : 200 points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hints for Game Play :

1) Avoid puddles and the sides of the track because these slow you down.

2) Accelerate and stay ahead of other racers.

3) Stick to the inside of the track to make the corners.

4) Successful completion of a turn depends on braking skill.

5) When sliding, steer into the skid.


* Instead of pressing down on the gas pedal for acceleration, placing your foot underneath the gas pedal and lifting the pedal up with your instep caused the car to go even faster.


* Easter Egg :

1) Enter service mode.

2) Turn wheel to 04; Change the shifter from LO to HI.

3) Turn wheel to 45; Change the shifter from LO to HI.

4) Turn wheel to 55; Change the shifter from LO to HI.

5) Turn wheel to 56; Change the shifter from LO to HI.

6) Turn wheel to 91; Change the shifter from LO to HI.

Pole Position II [Upright model] (c) 1983 Namco.


Pole Position II is a 1-player game using a color raster-scan video display. Game action takes place at 4 different raceways - the Fuji Speedway in Japan, the Test Track (an oval track like Indy), the Seaside Speedway (with the Long Beach Pike in the background), and the Suzuka Speedway in Japan. The unique and picturesque scenery around each raceway adds exciting realism to each race!


The driver drives a Formula-1 race car on each track. Player controls consist of a steering wheel, a two-position gear shifter, an accelerator, and a brake pedal (on the Sit-Down cabinet). The first objective of the game is to finish the qualifying lap as quickly as possible. If the driver beats the time, he qualifies for the race. If he does not qualify, he drives the remainder of his time along the qualifying course.


As a qualifier, the driver is ranked according to his qualifying lap time, from position one (the pole position) to position eight. Then the driver's second objective is to race against the clock and other cars to finish the race laps as fast as possible, and to achieve the highest score possible. The driver earns points for passing cars, driving on the track, and finishing the race with time remaining. The time remaining from the Racing Lap is added to the extended lap time.


To start the Play Mode, a driver must first insert the correct number of coin(s) for a game (according to the coin dip switch settings, 1 coin/1 credit is the default for both 'Coin A' and 'Coin B' dips). Then the driver turns the steering wheel until the track he wants to drive on is highlighted in white. The Play Mode will begin when the driver steps on the accelerator. The driver's car will appear behind the starting line and a certain amount of time, in seconds ('Game Time' dip switch setting; the default is 90 seconds) will be on the clock. The car must finish the qualifying lap within the time allotted to be in the race. If the driver does not qualify, his car continues on the track until the 'Game Time' elapses.


If the driver has qualified, just before the race begins, the driver's car (flashing on the screen) is placed at the starting line with seven other cars. The position of the car depends on the position earned during the qualifying lap.


The starting lights flash from red to green, and the race begins. Racing hazards are other racing cars, sharp turns, water puddles, and road signs (all of these hazards also appear during the qualifying lap with the exception of water puddles). As the race progresses, more cars appear on the track. If the driver's car hits another car or a road sign, the driver's car is destroyed in an explosion. (Pole Position II adds flying debris to the visual effect.) The driver's car reappears in a few seconds and the race continues. Driving through water puddles or off the track slows down the driver's car considerably.


Experience will teach a driver which turns on which tracks require slight steering (because they're banked) and which turns require fast and forceful steering. He jockeys for position with the other racers, while keeping his eye on the clock at the top of the screen. When his time runs out, the race is over. If he has beaten the racing lap time and has seconds remaining, the remaining seconds are added to the extended lap time, which varies depending on the track and the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting.


The top score achieved by a driver appears at the top of the screen. The time allotted for the lap is displayed under the top score. Increasing lap time (in seconds and hundredths of a second) and the speed of the car appears last. Each track has its own separate high score list.

The upright version of Pole Position II came in a standard Atari cabinet (similar to the "Asteroids"/"Lunar Lander" cabinet), with an altered control panel area. The sideart consisted of red, white, blue, and grey striped paint job, with an Atari logo, and a square sticker showing a race scene. While the marquee had a Pole Position II logo superimposed over a checkerboard pattern. This is the exact same cabinet used in the original "Pole Position",the only thing that was changed was the marquee, and the outlines of the courses shown on the control panel. The control panel was done up in the same colors as the side, and featured an analog steering wheel, and a two position shifter.


There was also a cockpit version of this game. This was one completely different than the original "Pole Position" cockpit. It shipped in a single piece, and had a clear window in the back for observers to watch the action. It had little in the way of decoration inside, but the exterior was completely covered in detailed race car scenes that were much more attractive than those on the original "Pole Position". The cockpit Pole Position II cabinet had both a gas pedal and a brake pedal, while the upright cabinets had only a gas pedal.


Lloyd Dahling holds the official record for this game on the 'Fuji' track with 75,390 points.

Jeff Peters holds the official record for this game on the 'Seaside' track with 75,390 points.

Jeff Peters also holds the official record for this game on the 'Suzuka' track with 75,660 points.

Jeff Peters also holds another official record for this game on the 'Test' track with 81,870 points.


- UPDATES -


* The Atari version has an extra dip switch setting ("Speed Unit") that allows the user to toggle between using the English system and the Metric system to measure the speed of the player's car (as shown on the upper-right corner during game play). By default, the game uses the Metric system. Namco's original version does not have this dip and exclusively uses the Metric system.

* At the start of the game in the Fuji and Suzuka tracks, a gray blimp with the Namco logo carries the white banner across the screen in the Namco version while a gray unmarked blimp carries the white banner across the screen in the Atari version. In the Test and Seaside tracks, a biplane carries the banner instead of the blimp on both Namco and Atari versions.

* The message on the banner is now displayed in red letters (in a different font from the original Pole Position game) with a blue outline.

* Instead of "Game Over", the Pole Position II logo spins into the screen after the game ends, fading into the title screen, which no longer shows a track or displays the distance of a full lap (now that there are four tracks to choose from).

* There are now billboards for '7-Eleven', 'Tang', and 'Dentyne' on all tracks in the Atari version, and various billboards including 'Pepsi', 'Marlboro', and 'Champion' in the Namco version.  

* The Test and Suzuka tracks feature a 'Dunlop Formula SP' arch in Namco's version; this arch is replaced by a spectator bridge (with spectators watching the race from the bridge) in the Atari version.

* The sign above the cars at the start of the race says "Start". When the player completes a lap, the sign says "Namco" in the Namco version and "Goal" in the Atari version. (In the Atari revision of the original Pole Position game, the sign said "Fuji" when the player completed a lap.)

2 cabinet versions existed, named ECS1 and ECS2. ESC means "Elektronischer Spielcomputer". The difference was a better cabinet for ECS2.


10 programs exist, only eight could be choosen for deployment (in EPROM-Order):


"Hase und Wolf" translates from German as 'Rabbit and Wolf', based on the Russian cartoon series 'Nu, pogodi!', popular in the GDR.

"Hirschjagd" translates from German as 'Deer Hunt'.

"Schmetterlinge" translates from German as 'Butterflies'.

"Abfahrtslauf" translates from German as 'Departure Run'.

"Schiessbude" translates from German as 'Shooting Hut'.

"Autorennen" translates from German as 'Car Race'.

"Merkspiel" translates from German as 'Noticing Play'.

"Wasserrohrbruch" translates from German as 'Water Pipe Break'.

"Hagelnde Wolken" translates from German as 'Hailing Clouds'.

"Der Taucher" translates from German as 'The Diver'.


2 additional games were planned :

"Der Gärtner" translates from German as 'The Gardener'.

"Im Gewächshaus" translates from German as 'The Greenhouse'.


The last manufactured versions, in 1989, have had the possibility of ten games.


The story goes that Poly-Play was the only arcade approved machine to be produced in GDR and they used to go into places like FDGB holiday homes and youth hostels. When the Berlin Wall came down, for some strange reason they recalled the machines to the factory and had them dismantled. A few were salvaged. There were probably about 1000-1500 made (last known serial number 1492 from 1989).


The company does exists as 'Polytechnik Frankenberg GmbH'.

Pooyan (c) 1982 Konami.


The player takes on the role of a bow-and-arrow welding pig who must protect her piglets from the pack of hungry wolves ballooning up or down the cliff face. The pig is suspended in a winch-controlled cage and must move vertically up and down, shooting the balloons and sending the wolves plummeting to the ground. Any wolves she missies will, having safely reached the ground, climb a ladder to try and bite her. Also, if any of the wolves reach the ground, more piglets will be captured by them. Mother Pig must try to kill as many wolves as possible without letting them reach the ground.


On the second level, the wolves use balloons to float upwards to the top of a high cliff. If enough of them reach the cliff, they will push a huge boulder down onto Mother Pig's cage. After this level has been completed, the piglets who have been captured are rescued and the game starts over with increased difficulty.


There is also a bonus round where Mother Pig will attempt to eliminate as many wolves on ascending balloons as possible by throwing as few slabs of meat as possible for a maximum bonus score.

Pooyan is Japanese for 'little pigs'. It is also very rarely used as an adjective meaning 'extremely stupid'. For example, 'Intentionally puncturing your spacesuit is pooyan', or 'Injecting straight heroin into your eyeballs is a pooyan idea'.


Pooyan is among the most innovative shooters in history and cute besides.


The intro tune is a renditon of 'Mori no Kumasan' (Mr. Bear of the Forest), written by Umaba Yoshihiro. It is a all-time children's favourite Japanese folk song.


The Round 1 in-game tune is a rendition of 'Humoresque (Op. 101, No. 7 in G flat major)' by Antonin Dvorak.

A Pooyan unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Learn how a meat piece falls : unlike arrows, meat pieces fly not straight but in an arc.


* Throw meat pieces at enemy formations : When arrows are not enough to take out a formation, use meat pieces to wipe them all out. Knowing how a meat piece falls will work in your advantage.


* When to use meat pieces ? : At the end of a level appears a wolf with a balloon hard to pop. Keep the meat piece until the very end and use it against that particular wolf.


* Do not underestimate the power of the balloon : As the game proceeds, there will be balloons with no wolves holding onto them. While it will not count as a miss even if you don't take out these balloons, they bounce off meat pieces. be careful!


* Shoot down rocks with arrows : Rocks thrown by wolves can be reflected with the roof of MAM's gondola and by shooting arrows. Stay calm even if you see a bunch of rocks coming at you.

Popeye (c) 1982 Nintendo.


A superb and demanding platform game featuring characters from the famous King Features Syndicate cartoon show of the same name. The aim of the game is to rescue Popeye's girlfriend, Olive Oyl. This is achieved by catching a set number of objects thrown down by Olive from the top of the screen; such as hearts, letters and musical notes. Popeye is constantly pursued in his quest by love rival, Bluto (a.k.a. Brutus). Popeye must either run away from Bluto or grab some spinach and punch him off the screen (he will, of course, return).


Should any of Olive Oyl's items fail to be caught, they will fall into the water at the bottom of the screen. Popeye will then have only a few seconds to retrieve the object or a life is lost. Several other Popeye characters also make an appearance in the game; namely Wimpy, Sweet-pea, the Sea Hag and her Vulture, whose name is Bernard. The game's three levels are the dock scene, the street scene and the shipboard scene. These repeat with increasing difficulty.


- TECHNICAL -


Most Popeye machines were upright cabinets, but cocktails were also available. The upright was in the standard Nintendo cabinet, the same one used in "Donkey Kong", "Donkey Kong Junior", "Radar Scope", "Donkey Kong 3", and "Sky Skipper". Almost all other Nintendo titles used alternate versions of this same cabinet, "Mario Bros". was wider, "Punch Out!!" was taller, etc, but they were still nearly identical. A dedicated Popeye machine will be blue, although you will sometimes see them in different colors (non-blue Popeyes are conversion cabinets).

* Popeye From Strip To Screen : Popeye the Sailor, one of the most enduring characters in animation history, began not in motion pictures but in E.C. 'Elzie' Segar's 'Thimble Theater' comic strip. Born in Illinois, Segar began cartooning in Chicago in 1914. Graduating to his own strip for the Chicago American, Segar was then hired in 1919 by Hearst's New York Evening Journal to create the syndicated 'Thimble Theater' strip. 'Thimble Theater' depicted the adventures of Ham Gravy, his girlfriend Olive Oyl and her brother Castor. The venture was a success, expanding to an additional Sunday color page in 1924. Segar's comic strip used complex, rambling and frequently eerie narratives that attracted a devoted following, but it lacked strong central characters. In the 'Thimble Theater' of January 17, 1929, Ham and Castor decided to hire a crew to sail in search of the legendary Whiffle Hen. Walking up to a grizzled one-eyed mariner on a dock, Castor asked him, "Are you a sailor?" "`Ja think I'm a cowboy?" came the reply, introducing Popeye to readers.


* Move Over, Ham Gravy : Over a period of months, Popeye developed from a supporting character to the central figure in the hunt for the Whiffle Hen. When Segar finally brought the narrative to a close and tried to retire the sailor, outraged fans contacted the Hearst syndicate demanding more adventures with Popeye. Segar obliged them : the sailor replaced Ham as Olive's love interest, Castor Oyl was reduced to infrequent appearances, and the strip was renamed 'Thimble Theater, Starring Popeye'.


The early 1930s was a period of keen competition among American animation studios for market share. Central to the business strategy of most studios was the development of cartoon 'stars' whose popularity would ensure bookings by major theater chains. Disney followed the success of Mickey Mouse by developing new characters like Donald Duck and Goofy up from supporting roles in Mickey Mouse cartoons. Similar strategies were tried at Warner Bros., where Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck evolved from secondary roles in films starring other animated characters. One of the earliest examples of this took place at the Fleischer Studios, Inc. in New York, where the unpopular starring canine character Bimbo was matched up with a girlfriend in Dizzy Dishes (1930). The girlfriend eventually developed into Betty Boop, the studio's major character. With the popularity of Betty Boop at a peak in 1932, brothers Max and Dave Fleischer decided to introduce a new film series which would include another character to grow into a star. Fleischer rival Van Beuren Corporation had already signed an agreement to bring Otto Soglow's strip 'The Little King' to the screen. Max Fleischer, who was a great fan of Segar's strip, approached Hearst's King Features Syndicate for the right to use Popeye. The two companies signed an agreement on November 17, 1932.


* Betty Introduces Popeye to the Big Screen : The production of the first Popeye film took place in secrecy. Veteran animator Roland Crandall was given space apart from the rest of the studio. There, he single-handedly animated the entire cartoon, aided only by the inclusion of some Shamus Culhane animation recycled from the earlier Betty Boop's Bamboo Isle (1932). The results were so satisfying that even before the film was released, the Fleischers and King Features amended the agreement granting the studio the right to produce and release animated cartoons featuring Popeye for a five year period.


Crandall's film 'Betty Boop Presents Popeye The Sailor' opened in the summer of 1933 as part of the 'Betty Boop' series. After a prologue in which newspapers herald the sailor's film debut, and Popeye sings 'I'm Popeye the Sailor Man', the film featured what was to be the standard 'Popeye' series plot, re-enacted with variations by the Fleischers for the next decade. Olive waits for Popeye to disembark from his ship at the dock. Bluto follows the couple to a fairground, where the two sailors compete for Olive's attentions through feats of strength. Bluto abducts Olive and ties her to a train track. As the locomotive approaches, Popeye and Bluto fight. Popeye defeats Bluto, and, through the magical powers of spinach, is able to stop the train and save Olive Oyl. Here, we see the essential difference between the Segar and Fleischer sense of narrative. Segar reveled in picaresque plots that coursed in unexpected directions for up to two years, exploring every novel twist and nuance of narrative. In anticipation of post-modernism, the very concept of plot was old-fashioned to the Fleischers. Hackneyed and ritualized story conventions were torn apart, recombined in odd juxtapositions, and satirized in endless variations.


The Fleischer Popeye cartoons were an instant success. "It might have been just a fluke, a lucky break, that the Segar characters fit the Fleischer style so well", recalls former Popeye animator Myron Waldman. "The animation of Olive Oyl in the mid-1930s was perfect. It fit her. The character had no elbows and the most prominent knees. When she spoke, the voice fit too. This was character. That's what made her so good".


* Step Aside, Mickey : Segar's characters were not the only things consistent with the Fleischer style. Both Segar and the Fleischer staff shared a fondness for a poetically improvisational language. When Popeye's original voice artist, William 'Red Pepper Sam' Costello, left after the first few pictures, he was replaced by a studio in-betweener named Jack Mercer. Much of the dialogs of the Popeye cartoons was post-synched with little attention to synchronized mouth action. Mercer, Mae Questel (Olive's voice, except for the 1938-41 period, when Margie Hines was the voice artist) and William Penell or Gus Wickie, who voiced Bluto, often ad-libbed dialogs during recording sessions, particularly Popeye's 'asides' and pun-filled conversations. Added to this was a progressive softening and increased complexity of Popeye's character, paralleling changes in the strip. Popeye cartoons became the Fleischers' leading attraction. By 1938, Popeye replaced Mickey Mouse as the most popular cartoon character in America.


The Fleischers rummaged through the Segar strip for supporting characters. Bluto, the animated series' antagonist, was a minor character in the Segar strip, appearing only in 1933's 'The Eighth Sea'. Longer-lived strip characters that joined Popeye on the screen included hamburger maven J. Wellington Wimpy, Swee'pea, Eugene the Jeep and Poopdeck Pappy. While in the comic strip, Popeye gained his great strength from rubbing the Whiffle Hen, the Fleischers added the gimmick of Popeye's power being largely dependent on the ingestion of spinach. Farmers in America's self-styled 'spinach capital' of Crystal City, Texas set up a statue of Popeye in gratitude for the publicity.


As early as 1935, the Fleischers sought backing for a feature-length animated film from their distributor Paramount. Paramount refused to risk money on a feature. In an attempt to persuade the company that longer animated films could be profitable, Max Fleischer initiated the production of three two-reel color 'specials' starring Popeye, beginning with 'Popeye The Sailor Meets Sinbad The Sailor' (1936). Although these 'specials' were often billed over their accompanying feature, Paramount still refused to back the animated feature.


Conditions changed after the success of Disney's 'Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs' (1937) and the Fleischers received money for the eighty minute Gulliver's Travels. According to some sources, the film was originally to have Popeye in the role of Gulliver, but the idea was scrapped early in the planning stages. Perhaps this was unwise. According to internal Paramount correspondence, the Popeye shorts were far more profitable to Paramount than Disney's films were to his distributor, RKO. The sailor's box-office appeal might have helped the Fleischer features. Gulliver's Travels (1938) and the company's next feature, Mr. Bug Goes To Town (1941), bombed, leading to the failure of Fleischer Studios, Inc.


* Post-Fleischer Popeye : The successor company, Famous Studios, continued with the production of Popeye cartoons. Many of these were remakes of earlier Fleischer films. Much of the supporting cast of the Fleischer versions were replaced by new characters, such as identical nephews Pip-Eye, Peep-Eye, Poop-Eye and Pup-Eye. A redesign of the major characters included white U.S. Navy uniforms for Bluto and Popeye (in keeping with their war-time service in the armed forces), and more comely fashions for Olive. Upgraded technology, including the introduction of color to the series in 1943 with Her Honor The Mare and 3-D in Popeye The Ace Of Space (1953), tried to rejuvenate the series. None of these strategies were able to breathe much life into the films. Spooky Swabs (1957) brought theatrical release of Popeye films to a close.


The success of the black and white Popeye cartoons on television in the 1950s inspired several revivals of the series by such talents as Gene Deitch, John Halas and Joy Batchelor, Jack Kinney, and Hanna-Barbera. Hampered by limited budgets and rushed production schedules, none of these came close to the Fleischer or Famous theatrical versions. The less said about Robert Altman's live-action feature with Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall as Popeye and Olive Oyl, the better. What has endured are the original qualities of the Segar and Fleischer works. In fact, Segar's strips have been reissued by Nostalgia Press and the Smithsonian Press. The earlier Fleischer films, which shared the shabby urban or surreal exotic locations and working-class orientation of the Segar originals, retain a vitality and charm that still appeal to a large group of devoted fans today.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* A Display Glitch : On the musical note level, you can stand at the point on the edge where you 'wraparound' and if you punch a bottle in the right spot, it'll erase part of the 'THRU' sign. This can be done on both sides.


* LEVEL ONE :


1) On the first level, Olive Oyl stands at the top of the screen and throws 24 hearts (one at a time) down to the bottom, hoping that Popeye will catch them all. If a heart reaches the bottom of the screen, you will have about 10 seconds to pick it up before it breaks, costing you one life. Try to catch the hearts as high as possible, since they decrease in value as they get closer to the bottom.


2) When Bluto harasses you, cross the edge of the screen from left to right and wait for him to stop directly underneath the bucket. Hit the punching bag at this point and the bucket will fall onto his head, rendering him helpless for a while. This will score you points based on which floor Bluto is on when you hit him (see Scoring above) and give you some time to catch a few more hearts.


3) Like in the cartoons, Popeye becomes stronger after eating Spinach. A can of Spinach moves between the second and third floors of the screen and you can have Popeye eat it by punching the can. Afterwards, Popeye will turn red and become stronger than Bluto for about 10 seconds (shorter in later levels). If you can punch Bluto at this time, he falls into the sea, temporarily knocked out, and you will be awarded 3,000 points.


4) Bluto will eventually recover so make good use of this time by catching as many falling hearts as possible. They don't move, and they are worth twice as much when Popeye is under the influence of Spinach, so catching some of the higher hearts can really help your score. And since extra lives are only awarded at a very high score (60,000 points on most machines; 20,000 points by default on Revision F machines), you should be as greedy as possible.


5) Spinach can only be used once per level, and it is never restored after you lose a life (except in Revision F, see Updates above). Do not use it too soon; collect about two thirds of the total number of hearts, and have as many hearts fill the air as possible before getting the Spinach.


6) If you want to risk getting 4,000 points instead of 2,000, do not use the punching bag immediately. Wait until you have punched Bluto (best done when after eating Spinach) and next position Popeye to the punching bag. After Bluto comes out of the sea, he will move underneath the bucket on the bottom floor. With some practice and timing you should be able to drop the bucket onto his head for 4000 points. NOTE : touching Bluto while the bucket is on his head is not fatal. But be careful, because after the bucket comes off he can easily knock out Popeye.


7) To make up for his lumbering slowness, Bluto is capable of throwing beer bottles at Popeye. You should try to force him to throw bottles as often as possible (four at a time) instead of avoiding them, so you can score extra points.


8) The Sea Hag also throws bottles, except she only throws one at a time. The Sea Hag materializes on the edge of the screen for a moment, chucks a bottle, and disappears. She can also be on both sides of the screen at once. So if you are caught between two Sea Hags or between Bluto and The Sea Hag, you will have to quick on the joystick and Punch button to survive. 


* LEVEL TWO : The second level is much like the first, except Olive Oyl is dropping musical notes now (16 of them, one at a time), the major difference is the layout, with Wimpy on the plank in the lower corner. If Popeye jumps off the second floor, he will be catapulted up to the third floor. With some careful timing, you can even make Popeye leap all the way up to the fourth floor, where Sweet-pea is waiting on a balloon platform. Touching the bottom of Sweet-pea will score 500 points (1000 points while under the influence of Spinach).


* LEVEL THREE :


1) The setting for the third level is a ship, with a sliding platform on the top floor. At the beginning of the board you should be able to slide Popeye across the platform several times, catching the letters H-E-L-P that Olive Oyl is dropping directly above.


2) Every time Popeye catches a letter, one step is added to a ladder which goes up to Olive Oyl When the ladder is finished, Olive Oyl is rescued. This is the most difficult level, because a total of 24 letters are needed to complete the ladder and save Olive Oyl. Bernard, the vulture, will constantly appear from the left side of the screen. While sliding back and forth across the platform, you should try to punch Bernard as many times as possible, to score 1,000 points per punch.


3) After Popeye has rescued Olive Oyl on the third level, there will be an intermission that will have Popeye's face while "I'm Popeye The Sailor Man" plays followed by Popeye blowing his pipe and going "Toot! Toot!". Afterwards, the game begins again with increased difficulty.


On ALL levels, Bluto can reach from underneath or bend down from higher floors to lower ones- be careful that you are not underneath him. 


When the game restarts from the first level with increased difficulty, The Sea Hag will throwing down deadly bouncing skulls from the edges of the screen and must be punched when they are bouncing upward. You must also make sure that there are no skulls directly above Popeye, since they drop down a floor or two and hit him on the head. 


Continue to avoid Bluto, Bernard, the beer bottles, and the skulls, and keep catching whatever Olive Oyl throws down.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Thunder Serve : Hold the Up/Left Diagonal before pressing the serve button, and before hitting the ball hold the Down/Left Diagonal when the ball becomes red and press the button. This serve does an ace anytime except in the last two games, but you can also do it. You must press the button a bit before the ball becomes red, and you'll make an ace on the last line on the ground. The ball looks like a missile shot from the air.


* Phantom Serve : Hold the Up/Right Diagonal before pressing the serve button, and before hitting the ball hold the Down/Right Diagonal and when the ball becomes red press the button. This serve does an ace always except with the last two games. The ball splits in three phantom balls.


* Towering Serve : Hold Up before serving and hit the ball a bit before the ball becomes red. The ball leaves the screen and you don't know where it falls down.

- TRIVIA -


A little game (the third developed by Nihon Maicom Kaihatsu (NMK) for Jaleco, after "Argus" and "Valtric") which did not have huge success, it nevertheless became a 'cult game' for many players thanks to the brilliant gameplay, hard-to-find secret bonuses and anime-like plot. The inspiration for the design of the five ESPers comes from several Japanese cartoons of the '70s where the physical aspect of main characters was strongly stereotyped to suit their psychological profile/fighting ability.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Secret Bonus : There is a secret bonus in every round. To get them, you must hit the right [?] (question mark box) when your score fits a certain qualification.

1) The first level 'secret' is near the first phone. You should jump on the wall between the two bowls, then jump up and to the left. You'll land near a [?]. If you are in the right place, a walking clock should appear within 2/3 seconds. You can get a secret bonus from this box if you hit it when the thousands digit of your score is zero. (e.g. : 00000, 10500, 20900). The first secret is worth 10000 pts.

2) The second level 'secret' is near the first phone (yes, like the first one). There are 2 [?]'s on the lower-left corner of your screen (when you are near the phone); the upper one is a 'normal' [?], but you have to destroy it in order to reach the other one. You can get the secret bonus by hitting it when the thousands digit of your score is 1. This is worth 50000 pts.

3) The third one is near a phone, again, and near the fishbowl too. When you can reach the upper-right corner of the screen, and 2 umbrellas are floating above you, THAT is the right phone. There is also an extra bonus somewhere near that. You should use the short boy or the little girl to reach the secret bonus - it's at the end of the "small corridor" where the other 2 guys (the tall one and the fat one) can't enter. To get it you should hit the [?] when the thousands digit is 2. This should be worth 100000 pts.

4) If you miss a bonus, the thousands counter for the next bonus is modified accordingly. In other words, the thousands digit of your score must always be equal to the number of times you have previously gotten the secret bonus. Thus the tips above are correct only if you are getting every secret bonus without missing any - otherwise, deduct the number you've missed from the thousandth digit needed. Clear as mud? ;)

5) The 'ALL GOLD' bonus. Very simple to explain, but hard to do : When you break a bowl, the item you find in it is the same as the previous bowl, if you don't use your hammer after you hit the first and before the second. If you do, instead, the item "shifts", and you find the "next" in the order. If you go on hammering, the "rotation" can bring the first item back again. The first level has 4 items, so if you 'shoot' 0/4/8/12/16... times after breaking the first bowl, you find the same item in the second one. This is true unless you already 'finished' an item, otherwise you should "shoot" 0/3/6/9/12... times to find the item twice.


* Get Espers Sooner : Normally you get Makoto in scene 3 and Genzoh in scene 5, but you can get the espers sooner.

1) Get the 'All Gold' bonus in scene 1 and you'll find Makoto in scene 2.

2) Get Makoto in scene 2 and get the Secret Bonus in scene 3 and you'll find Genzoh in scene 3.

3) Get the 'All Gold' bonus in scene 3 and you'll find Genzoh in scene 4 (if you have not gotten him in scene 3).

Psycho Soldier (c) 1987 SNK.


Psycho Soldier is a 1986 release by SNK. It is a side-scrolling shooter featuring two-player simultaneous play. The major character is a girl named Athena. She fires blasts of psychic energy as her main weapon. She can collect orbs which she can control telepathically. These orbs protect her from some projectiles and can also be launched at targets. The orbs will explode on impact. Her companion, a boy named Kensu, can help her with his own powers. Together they clean up a ruined city full of monsters and mutants.

Psycho Soldier was the first-ever video game featuring a vocal soundtrack. The Japanese lyrics for the Psycho Soldier theme is also used as the Psycho Soldier team's team music in KOF94 and 96, as well as Athena's theme music in KOF 97 and 02.


Psycho Soldier's Soundtrack was released as a bonus with the purchase of Nintendo Famicom's Athena. It also included a vocal version of the ending theme.


The main character, Athena, appears in The King of Fighters series. Kensu, wearing a different outfit, appears in The King of Fighters series as 'Sie Kensou'. Kensu, as he appears here in Psycho Soldier, appears as a striker character in "The King of Fighters 2000" as ''Psycho Soldier Kensou''.


- UPDATES -


The Japanese and US versions have song lyrics in Japanese and English respectively.


Here is the lyrics for the Japanese version :

Psycho Ball ga hikari hanachi -

Athena no sugata terashi dasu no -

Psycho Soldier yami o saite -

Athena wa yume o suki dasu no.

Psycho Power o kokoro ni himete -

Hateshinai michi o hashiru -

Ima wa mo aozora mienai kedo...

Fire! Fire! Psycho Soldier! (x2)

Psycho Soldier ga yami o saite -

Athena wa yume o suki dasu no -

Psycho Beam no kagayaki nokoshi -

Athena wa mirai o motome tabidatsu.

Honoo no yoni moeru hitomi -

Kibo no kakaera o mitsume -

Ima wa moda namida misenai wa!

Fire! Fire! Psycho Soldier! (x2)

Psycho Beam no kagayaki nokoshi -

Athena wa mirai o motome tabidatsu.

Dare hitori shiranai ashita -

Hino tori no sugata karite -

Honoo no yoni moero hitomi -

Kibo no kakarea o mitsume -

Psycho Power o kokoro ni himete -

Hateshinai michi o hashiru -

(repeats)


Here's the english version :

Athena's name is magic -

mystery is what you see -

her crystal is the answer -

fighting fair -

to keep us free -

she's just a little girl with power inside -

burning bright -

you'd better hide if you are bad -

she'll get you -

she'll read your mind and find if -

you believe in right or wrong -

fire, fire psycho soldier.


- SCORING -


Lightning  flashing column :  Shooting power increases 

Blue ball(s) flashing column : provides psycho ball(s) for psycho shooting and defense shield 

Red beam flashing column : Increases psycho energy

Skull flashing column : AVOID. drains your psycho energy (doesn't kill you) Flashing rainbow square - Better jumping response and dexterity

Red Sword : break stone with one hit, allows fire through stone and walls

Large blue ball : Turns all enemies in psycho balls and their projectiles into ballons

Orange ball with blue center : Increases fire speed

Infinity sign : Ability increase : ???  

Arrow up : AVOID. Ugrades enemies into more advanced enemies

Arrow down : downgrades enemies 

Large red skull : AVOID. Takes away all extra powers and leaves you with basic powers

Large red ball with "F" : Instant maximum psycho energy 

Pillar formations : shoot these and a floating ballon or saucer comes out. Grab for bonus points. The longer you wait before grabbing, the higher the point value (up to 8000 points).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Movement : Move Athena or Kensu left or right along platforms. Make them move up or down to jump to other platforms. They will not get hurt by long falls.


* Forming Pillars : Don't walk on them. You'll trip and be vulnerable to attack!


* Attacking with Psycho Bolts : Press the primary fire button to standard bolts of energy. These can punch through stone as well as through enemies. If you break a stone and it contains a lightning capsule, you can power up your primary attack.


* Using the Psycho Balls : Sometimes you'll find balls floating on the screen. If you grab them, then they will circle around Athena. By pressing the secondary fire button, you can launch them at your enemies. They can destroy anything in their path short of a boss or some of the later creatures. Your ammo is listed at the bottom of the screen, above your life count. Using psycho balls does drain some energy from Athena. The more energy you have, the more powerful the ball attack is. Psycho balls also act as a limited form of defense. The more energy you have, the faster they revolve around your character. They can block small projectiles and small flying creatures.


* Using the sword : A sword is hidden in some blocks. When you get a sword, your shots will now pass through stone. You must walk up to a stone and hit it with the sword to break it (use the fire button). The sword lasts for a while (probably a set number of strikes). The sword may also be used against enemies at very close range.


* Becoming the Psycho Creature : If your energy bar is full and you have collected lots of psycho balls, you should break stones until a green egg pops out. When you break the egg, a special item will appear that changes Athena into a phoenix (Kensu becomes a green dragon). The phoenix has a powerful breath attack and can ram enemies to kill them. The breath attack has no penalty for use, but you use energy whenever you ram an enemy or you get hit by a projectile. If your energy bar is not full, or you don't have enough psycho balls, the egg will release a large number of maggots. Therefore, try not to be close to an egg when you break it. If you're too close, the maggots will swarm you.

PuLiRuLa (c) 1991 Taito.


A 6-level, sideways scrolling beat-em-up for 1 or 2 players that defies any logic in either its theme or its graphical approach; that places the players in a dream-like world populated by armies of strange and bizarre creatures.


PuLiRuLa's plot centres around the world of 'Radishland'. Each of Radishland's six towns is kept running smoothly with the aid of a giant key, which is necessary to keep the world's 'time-flow' moving. The key is stolen by a mysterious enemy and the timeflow is disrupted. Players must fight their way through waves of increasingly abstract enemies in their quest to recover the key and restore time to Radishland.


To aid players in their quest, they are each armed with a magical stick, with which they can hit and defeat the game's abstract enemies. Players are also armed with a limited number of smart bombs, capable of killing multiple enemies. The smart bombs are as visually unique as the rest of the game; taking the form of such things as a herd of running animals, a purple dancing blob-like man or a man in a giant microwave oven who captures and cooks any on-screen enemies. When killed, the enemies diappear and an animal or townsperson is released from inside the creature.

An accomplished and graphically superb sideways scrolling shoot-em-up that borrows many of its visual and gameplay elements from all three games in Irem's legendary "R-Type" series; including the Beam weapon and R-type's infamous pod attachment. Unlike "R-Type", however, Pulstar's pod cannot be detached from the front of the ship and merely acts as a shield to protect the player's ship.


Pulstar consists of eight challenging levels, with the player able to start the game on any one of the first four.

Punch-Out!! (c) 1984 Nintendo.


The player assumes the role of a green-haired boxer, who must fight his way through six increasingly larger-than-life boxers to earn the title of 'Champ' in this superb 1-on-1 fighting game.


During matches, the player's boxer is viewed from behind as a wire-frame (so the player's opponent can be seen). Players must time their punches, dodges and blocks in order to defeat the opposing boxer.


The player's opponents are each rendered as humorous cartoon-like caricatures - adding much to the game's atmosphere - and each boxer fights in a slightly different style, forcing players to adapt to their strategy. The top monitor is used for statistics while the bottom one is used to display the actual fight.

Released in February 1984.


Punch-Out's innovative game-play and memorable graphics and speech did much to ensure its popularity throughout the 1980s.


The game's title music, is actually the 'Gillette Look Sharp March'. This jingle, originally heard in Gillette radio and television commercials, was later used as the theme song to the Gillette Cavalcade of Sports, which aired boxing matches. The music can also be heard in the 1980 boxing related film 'Raging Bull' during the scene where Jake LaMotta (as played by Robert De Niro) unveils his new nightclub.


Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr. appear as spectators in the crowd - on both sides of the ring.


Rac Carpana holds the official record for this game with 15,999,990 points.


A Punch-Out!! arcade unit can be seen in the 1987 movie 'Over the Top'.


A Game & Watch version was also released the same year under the title 'Boxing'. It was renamed to 'Punch-Out!!' for it's special 1988 U.S. release.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Here's the system for getting by everyone in 1 round of Punch-Out (warning : This system works on 9 out of 10 Punch-Out machines)...

1) Glass Joe : So easy that you'd have to be trying not to win. But to be 100% sure... Keep guard up till his eyes glow for a big punch, dodge, and hammer him with rights and lefts to the face. Repeat till down.

2) Piston Hurricane : Concentrate blows, especially lefts, to the abdomen. When he backs up and charges in, hit him with a blow to the stomach as soon as he charges into you, he'll go down for the count after the 2nd or third time.

3) Bald Bull : Fairly simple : Right, dodge, left left. Right, dodge left left. Look out for his upper cuts though (get out of the way! duh) and upon his bull-charge you have two options. A hit to the stomach when he is right under you puts him down for the count, but if your reflexes aren't optimum, you are better off at dodging and continuing the fight. Right to the face (or 2 lefts), dodge, right. NO BODY BLOWS TO BALD BULL except on the bull charge.

4) Kid Quick : Soooo easy : Right, dodge, right right dodge right right dodge right right dodge right right dodge right right (these all being blows to the head). VERY EASY as long as you don't lose your rhythm. If ya do get messed up you can usually recover with a a dodge and starting again. No blows to the stomach. This is basically what you'll be doing against Mr. Sandman.

5) Pizza Pasta : Basically you're waiting for him to screw up. Use the kid quick system till he backs off (with the Come on! Come on!) and DODGE his hook. Then pummel him with rights and lefts to the head (ONLY the head), and he won't be fighting back. Repeat till he's dead. If he pins you up against the ropes with shots to the stomach at some point, just get your guard down there and sneak in some lefts and you should break free.

6) Mr. Sandman, the champion : Kid Quick system exactly. Every now and then however he fires a very quick left or right to the head. When he hits you with one, dodge the opposite way of the hit quickly or you'll be going down.

- TRIVIA -


Released in April 1993.


This game features the main characters from the comic books respectively titled 'The Punisher' (First appearance : Amazing Spider-Man 129, 1973) and 'Nick Fury' (First appearance : Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos 1, 1963), Agent of SHIELD, both published by Marvel Comics. The acronym SHIELD stands for 'Surpreme Headquarters International Espionage Law-enforcement Division'.


Scully, the first of the boss villains here, is loosely based on a villain named Chester Scully who appeared in issues 22-23 (August and September, 1989) of the Punisher's first ongoing series, which ran from 1987 to 1995. The leaping kicks he uses in the game are an homage to the cover of the 23rd issue where his comic book counterpart is shown attacking the Punisher by kicking at him while jumping.


Bushwacker, the 4th stage boss, is based on the omonimous Marvel's super villain (enemy of Daredevil, The Punisher and Wolverine). Although, there are some aesthetic differences from his appearence in the game and in the original comic: half of his face is horribly scared in the comic, while in the game his face seems in good conditions. Also, his special right arm, altered bionically to function as a gun, is still revealed on his real form on the comic, while in the game he can turn his arms from normal form to guns form, like a type of mutant morph (and this should sound incongruous, because he's a mutant's hunter on the Marvel's comics). He appear on the Capcom's game before he was hired by Kingpin for kill Punisher in the original Punisher comic series, so his presence fit perfectly in the game's plot.


Jigsaw, the non-boss enemy appearing in the 2nd area of the final stage (elevator's top) is one of the most dangerous enemies of Punisher in the original comic series. Although, is showed different in the game - in the game he appears like a commando-mercenary, while in the comic he was a former killer of a notorious mobster family of New York. - By the way, his scared face (caused by the same Punisher on the comics) is identical on his original appearence on the comics.


Bruno Costa, the bald gangster with sunglasses appearing in the scenes of attract mode and during the first stages of the game, is also showed in the comic, and he's the responsable of the massacre of the Frank's Castle family, like the game says. However, Punisher killed him in the comic's series, while in the game he's killed by Guardroid (the 2nd stage boss).


Hidden Bonus Level : Looking in the game source code, there's a hidden second bonus game in stage directory. It shows an airplane hijacking or something and two of the generic game thugs burst through the winshield. They run across the screen to the left and then punisher shows up. There are several stewardesses on the floor as hostages and when you go over to them they get freed. But then the stage like instantly is interrupted and randomly takes you to the score screen after every stage and says 'Stage 7 complete' and then switches to an alternate credits screen with all the enenmies in the game running across and doing random things. It's probably a part of the game not completed and not remove from the final product and still present in the source code. The only way to see this hidden stage is to browse the source code or using a cheat with emulator like MAME.

- UPDATES -


The US version has the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.


Japanese version is a bit different :

* The Super Kick results in blue flames on the enemy instead of blood.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Super Kick : Down, Up+Attack


* Super AIR Kick : Forward(x2), Jump, Down+Attack


* Special Ending : finish the game without having to continue to see a different credit sequence (badguy parade).


* On 2nd area of first stage, the enemy Cool will appear for few seconds from a open door, then he will flee : if you're fast, you can kill him before he disappear with the handgun that the players draw automatically in that moment.


* When you're in the 2nd area of stage 2, the gangsters' mansion in Florida, there are 3 jail cells in which 3 girls are being held hostage. Break open the cells and then stand still. The girls will give the players thank-you hugs that restore energy to their lifebars.


* At the end of the 2nd stage you'll fight against the Guardroid. At the end of the room where the battle is set, you'll found an huge bed and a painting in the wall. Destroy this objects for obtain extra weapons and energy that could help you during the fight


* In the 3rd stage (the harbor) you'll encounter several cars, where gangster carrying machine gun will exit from there for attack the players. If you destroy those cars before they'll exit from there, they'll disappear in the explosion: also, you can see the poor driver carbonized after the car's explosion!


* The Punisher and Nick Fury's personal handguns are usually drawn automatically whenever enemies carrying firearms - and also the robots called 'Pretty Boy' - turn up. With the exception of the robots, which are tougher to deal with, try to refrain from killing the enemies armed with guns until after you've killed some of those who aren't carrying guns. This certainly comes in useful during the showdown at the end with the Kingpin, who's drawn much larger here than he was in Sega's own "Spider-Man - The Videogame", made 2 years earlier.

Puzzle Bobble (c) 1994 Taito Corp.


The first in the hugely successful puzzle series from Taito, Puzzle Bobble is a game for 1 or 2 players in which the aim is to clear each play area of the colored bubbles that litter it. This is achieved by firing bubbles up the screen - with the angle of trajectory dictated by the player - at the clusters of static colored bubbles that litter each play area. The aim is to forms chains of like-colored bubbles, thus making them disappear. At regular intervals, the bubbles will drop one row down the screen, making life more difficult for the players. The game is over when the bubbles reach the very bottom of the play area.


In the 1-player game there are thirty rounds to complete, whereas in the 2-player Vs. mode, the winner is the player who clears their play area first. The addictive yet straightforward game-play mechanic ensured that the "Puzzle Bobble" games would be the most successful of their genre since Russian programmer, Alexey Pajitnov's legendary "Tetris" was unleashed upon the gaming world in the late 1980s.

Released in June 1994.


The game was originally called "Bubble Buster". The Bubble Buster title screen is buried in the game itself.


This game is known in US as "Bust-A-Move".


This game was re-released 6 months later (December 1994) on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware as "Puzzle Bobble [MVS]".


As well as typically cute Japanese animation (the characters from "Bubble Bobble" operate the cannon) and music, the game's mechanics and level design were beautifully balanced, and the game was terrifically successful at the arcades, spawning several sequels (see Series section for more information). It is unusual in being popular with women and girls.


If you look closely at the bubbles, you'll notice that the enemies from "Bubble Bobble" are trapped inside; a different enemy for each different colored bubble. The following chart shows which enemies are trapped in which color bubble :

Legend : Color of Bubble => "Bubble Bobble" Enemy Inside

Blue => Zen-Chan

Yellow => Pulpul

Red => Invader

Green => Drunk

Purple => Monsta

Orange => Banebou

Black => Hidegonsu

White => Mighta


The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'AAA'.


During the credits you can see one of the constellations form the image of a fish, that fish is a boss from the "Darius" series; also made by Taito.


According to Twin Galaxies, the official electronic scoreboard, Kim Korpilahti holds the official records for this game with 16,013,660 points (difficulty 6) on 06/11/2004.


Zuntata Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Puzzle Bobble Variety - ZTTL-0009) on 06/07/2008.

Q*bert (c) 1982 Gottlieb.


The object of the Q*bert game is to change the color of the top of the cubes to the Destination color indicated at the upper-left of the screen (below Player 1's score) by hopping onto them. When all the cubes in the pyramid have been changed to the destination color, the screen will advance to the next Round, with the player-controlled Q*bert character starting back on the top cube. At the beginning of each Level, there will be a short demonstration cycle with Q*bert hopping around four cubes to explain to the player the play action of each Level. Each Level consists of four Rounds. The current Level number and Round number is displayed at the upper-right of the screen (below Player 2's score in a 2-player game).


The game play starts with Q*bert appearing at the top of the pyramid. The joystick will move Q*bert from cube to cube by hopping in any of four diagonal directions. Q*bert can move anywhere on the pyramid, but jumping off will kill him. Hopping on the rotating disk will take Q*bert back to the top of the pyramid. In the first two Rounds of play, Q*bert will have to avoid touching the red and purple balls. These deadly objects drop randomly onto the second-from-the-top level and bounce downwards. The red balls will fall off the bottom but the purple ball will stop at the bottom and hatch into Coily, the snake which chases Q*bert. To destroy Coily, lure him to the edge, then jump unto a disk. The disk will take Q*bert back to the top and Coily will fall off, awarding 500 points and clearing the board of all other 'nasty' characters.


Starting at the 3rd Round of play, other 'nasty' characters come into play. The green characters or objects are safe to hop onto and will award points. All other 'nasty' characters are deadly to touch. In the third Round the red balls will stop falling, but two purple characters named Ugg and Wrong Way will appear at the lower portion of the pyramid and travel sideways and upwards (Ugg is the one with the snout moving from right to left on the right sides of the cubes, and Wrong Way is the one with the big eyes moving from left to right on the left sides of the cubes). They will not chase Q*bert, but will move randomly to get in Q*bert's way. In the third Round and every Round after, based on an internal timer, a green ball will appear and bounce down from the top of the pyramid. Hopping Q*bert onto the green ball will award 100 points, and freeze all the characters on the screen for a few seconds, but 'Q*bert' will still be able to move to complete the color changes.


During the 4th Round of play, 2 green characters named Slick and Sam will appear, based on the internal timer (Slick is the one wearing shades; Sam does not wear shades, otherwise their function is identical). They will drop onto the second level from the top and hop randomly downwards. If they hop onto a cube that Q*bert has already changed the color of, the cube will change to a different color, to thwart Q*Bert. Hopping Q*Bert onto Slick or Sam will stop them and award 300 points.


Throughout the remaining Rounds, all the characters and objects will appear in random combinations with increasing speed.


To add variety to the game, the disks will change positions every Round, and in the higher Levels the number of disks will change.


During Level 2, the play action will increase in difficulty from changing the cubes to one color, to changing the color of the cubes twice. This mean: that each cube would have to be hopped on twice to change the pyramid to the destination color, completing the Round.


Starting at Level 3 and for all remaining Rounds, and Levels, the play action will become more difficult. The object remains to change the cubes to the designated color, but if Q*Bert hops on any cube, that cube will change color. So even if the cube has already been changed to the Destination color, it will change again.


Here is a rundown of how all the colors change :


Legend :

S - Starting Color

I - Intermediate Color

D - Destination color


LEVEL 1 : When Q*bert jumps on S or I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D (NOTE : In Round 4, when Slick/Sam jumps on D, it changes to I).


LEVEL 2 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D.


LEVEL 3 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again.


LEVEL 4 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to I. Q*bert must start again.


LEVEL 5 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again.


LEVELS 6-9 : Same color pattern as Level 5. The difference is the increased speed of Q*bert and the 'nasty' characters.


There are also Bonus points awarded at the end of each Round for successfully completing the Round. The Bonus for the completion of the First Round is 1,000 points. This Bonus will progressively increase each Round by 250 points to a maximum of 5,000 points at Level 5.

- TRIVIA -


Released in October 1982.

Licensed to Konami for Japanese distribution (February 1983).


Inspired by artwork by M.C. Escher who was an artist that Jeff admired. Ron Waxman came up with the idea of Q*bert changing the color of the cubes. Q*bert's name originated by the combination of 'Cube' and 'Hubert', but the 'Cube-Bert' was changed to 'Q-bert' to make it more unique. The concept game was called 'Snots and Boogers' and then '@!#?@!' (which many of the programmers and Gottlieb VPs said would be impossible to get anyone to say) before the final version was called just 'Q*bert'. Slick and Sam were a play on the phrase 'spick and span' with Sam being named after co-worker Sam Russo. Rick Tighe came up with the idea of adding the pinball hardware which generated the very mechanical KA-CHUNK when Q*bert falls off the pyramid.


A Votrax SC-01 speech synthesis chip is used to generate the incoherent speech of Q*bert swearing, Slick and Sam (high pitch) and Wrong-way and Ugg (low pitch). The only true speech ever generated is Q*bert saying 'Hello, I'm turned on' when the game is first powered up and 'Bye Bye' after entering your initials at the end of a game.


Approximately 30,000 units were produced by Gottlieb.


Several early cabinets were produced with '@!#?@!' on the marquee.


Bob Gerhardt holds the official records for this game in 'Marathon' setting with 33,273,520 points on 11/28/1983.

Tom Gault holds the official records for this game in 'Tournament' setting with 1,895,565 points.


A slightly different version known as 'Mello Yello' was programmed for promotion of the Mellow-Yellow softdrink, but it was never released to the market.


As well as being a huge commercial success as a game, Q*bert also provided revenue from its many tie-in products. Toys, games, and other products bearing the hero-s likeness all sold well. There was even a Q*bert cartoon; Saturday Supercade was a CBS cartoon series which featured a number of different segments starring various video game characters. In addition to the characters from the game, the Q*Bert segment featured Q*tee (Q*bert's girlfriend), Q*bit (his little brother), and others.


Such was the character's popularity at this time that Gottlieb assigned pinball designer, John Trudeau ("Creature From the Black Lagoon", "Congo"), to devise a Q*bert pinball. It was called "Q*bert's Quest" and Trudeau created an innovative design pattern that should have sparked arcade goers to try it. Remarkably, the table was a commercial flop. Released in March 1983, a paltry 884 machines dribbled out of the plant and further convinced management that pinball was indeed experiencing desperate times.


A Q*bert unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance'.


Parker Brothers released a boardgame based on this videogame (same name) in 1983 : Object of the game is to be one of the 'NOSER ELITE' by removing more pegs from the pyramid than your opponent (Peg plugged into cube = Starting color; Peg removed from cube = Destination color).

One player takes on the role of the hero, Q*bert, who must make his way around the pyramid trying to remove as many pegs as he can. A second player controls the 'nasty' characters out to thwart Q*bert.


- SCORING -


Changing a cube to the Intermediate color : 15 points.

Changing a cube to the Destination color : 25 points.

Catching Slick/Sam : 300 points.

Luring Coily off pyramid : 500 points bonus.

Completing a round : 750 points + 250 points x round number.

End of round bonus : 50 points per teleport disc remaining.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Control Panel Instructions :

Goal : Change the tops of all cubes to a new color by hopping onto them.

Joystick moves 'Q*bert' from cube to cube. Hopping onto a disk will take you back to the top.

All green objects are safe to hit. All other objects are deadly.

Destroy the snake by leading him to the edge, then jumping on a disk.

Stay on pyramid! Only jump off to use a disk.


* A big part of the game is waiting to see where 'nasty' characters are going to jump. You need to make sure you always time a jump at the same time the 'nasty' characters jump, so you can always have a clear path to a new square.


* Since the game only has 9 levels, if you can master level 9 then you should be able to play indefinitely since level 9 repeats once you reach it and the game doesn't get any harder.

Q*bert's Qubes (c) 1983 Mylstar Electronics.


The object of Q*bert's Qubes is to jump around diamond formation of 25 cubes and rotate them so that one or more rows of cubes match the shown target cube (a tic-tac-toe) while avoiding the meltniks, the rat and the purple guys. Jumping on anything green is safe, catching the turtle slows down enemies for a short time and catching the freeze ball freezes enemies for a short time.


Each level has four rounds and a bonus round and there are 11 levels...

Level 1 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, cubes only have 2 colors

Level 2 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, cubes only have 3 colors

Level 3 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, cubes have 6 colors from this point on

Level 4 : get 2 tic-tac-toes

Level 5 : get 3 tic-tac-toes

Level 6 : get 1 tic-tac-toe, matched target cubes can be rotated

Level 7 : get 2 tic-tac-toes, matched target cubes can be rotated

Level 8 : get 3 tic-tac-toes, matched target cubes can be rotated

Level 9 : get 4 tic-tac-toes

Level 10 : get 3 tic-tac-toes, matched target cubes can be rotated

Level 11 : get 3 tic-tac-toes


After this levels 9-11 repeat indefinitely.

This game was the first to have used both Mylstar and Gottlieb (Gottlieb was renamed Mylstar not too soon after the game was released, Warren Davis also joked that Mylstar is Rat Slime spelled backwards) on two different versions of the marquee).


A Votrax SC-01 speech synthesis chip is used to generate the incoherent speech of Q*bert swearing, Shoobops (high pitch) and Wrong Way and Ugg (low pitch). The only true speech ever generated is 'Hello, I'm turned on' when the game is first powered up and 'Bye Bye' after entering your initials at the end of a game.


The Rubik's Cube craze of the time served as a source of inspiration for this game.

Qix (c) 1981 Taito.


The objective of Qix is to claim a certain proportion of the playing field as your own. At the start of each level, the playing field is just a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qix - a stick-like entity that performs peculiar, erratic motions within the confines of the rectangle. The player controls a small marker that can move around the edges of the rectangle. To claim an area of the screen, the player must detach from an edge and draw Stix within the rectangle. Stix are simply lines traced out by moving the marker. When the marker traces out a closed shape, the area enclosed by the shape becomes solid and has been claimed. The player may draw either Fast Stix, which appear blue when solid, or Slow Stix, which appear red. Slow Stix take longer to draw, but are worth twice as many points. Once the player has claimed an area, the marker can safely move along the border of that claimed area. To complete a level, the player must claim 75% or more of the rectangle's area.

- TRIVIA -


Released in October 1981.


The author named the game 'QIX' (pronounced 'KICKS' and not 'QUIX') because his car registration/number plate at the time was : 'JUS4QIX'.


Qix is the first 'drawing game', a truly original game. Also the first totally Taito American game, Qix initially did big numbers, but quickly died when players discovered the machine was 'unbeatable'. Having a googolplex of possible combinations, there was no singular pattern to the game and players lost interest.


A Qix unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks' and in the 1984 movie 'The Karate Kid'.


- SCORING -


There are a couple of ways you earn points in Qix. The first involves actually claiming areas.


There are 2 buttons, slow and fast. These buttons determine how fast your Marker goes. In essence, going slow increases the risk of losing your Marker so it is obviously worth more points. Here's how the points work out for making 'boxes':

1) Slow : It is a base 500 points multiplied by the percentage of area covered by that box. For example, if you create a box that claims 3% of the total area, then points scored would be 500 X 3 or 1500 points. This area fills in with brown.

2) Fast : It is a base 250 points multiplied by the percentage of area covered by that box. For example, if you create a box that claims 1% of the total area, then points scored would be 250 X 1 or 250 points. This area fills in with blue.


NOTE : The above points may not be exact since the game rounds off the percentages to whole numbers for display but calculates them using decimal percentages.


You also get bonus points for going above the 75% Threshold. Any percentage above the 75% Threshold is multiplied by 1000 to determine your bonus points.


During the split Qix screens, if you successfully split the Qix's into their own compartments, you will get a multiplier bonus that is applied to points scored when you are making boxes. For example, if you had a 250 points and the multiplier was 3X, you now have 750 points. This multiplier increments by one every time you successfully split the Qix's. Of course, when you do this, you don't get the bonus points (if you had any).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your Marker will be at the bottom, middle of the playing screen. It is now up to you to start creating boxes. Keep in mind that you need to be constantly moving or the Sparx will take out your Marker. In addition, when you are moving your Marker around the perimeter, you can only move along the perimeter actually touching the Playing Field.


* First of all, you must be constantly aware of two things. First, you must know where the Qix is located at all times. It moves randomly and can go anywhere on the Playing Field that your boxes haven't blocked. Last, the Sparx are constantly moving around the perimeter of the Playing Field. This can set up a dangerous situation where one Sparx is coming at you from one way and another from the other to make your Marker a 'Sparx Sandwich'.


* Once you have assessed the danger, it is time to start making boxes. There are a few things to note when you are making boxes :

a) When you start to draw the line, the Sparx cannot travel along the new perimeter you are creating until it is filled in.

b) The Qix, though, is your primary concern. If it touches any part of a line before the box is filled in, you will lose your Marker.

c) The box must begin and end either at a filled box or on the side of the Playing Field. You cannot connect the line to itself. If you try to do this, you will go into what is called a 'Spiral Death Trap' and a Fuse will follow your line to your Marker and destroy it.


* After the fourth wave, the Qix will split in two. Now you have 2 Qix's bouncing around to deal with. You major goal is to actually 'split' the Qix's into their own areas. This means creating a series of boxes so that each Qix will be in its own compartment.


* For maximum points, you must do two things :

a) First, use the slow button as much as possible since this is where the points are.

b) Try to claim as much area in each box as possible. That percentage multiplied by the speed value can yield some big point values.

c) Constantly try to split the Qix's (if you can) to get that bonus multiplier even higher.

d) When you are close to the Threshold, find an area in the Playing Field that hasn't really been touched and try to make a big box. That way, you will go over the 75% Threshold and claim a bonus.


* As the waves progress, everything gets faster and the game will become less forgiving if you are less then committed to making a box.


* Also, listen for sounds in this game. The only real sound you need to be concerned with is what sounds like a fuse being lit. If you are making a box and you hear this sound, that means you are taking too long or you have unfortunately gotten yourself into a 'Spiral Death Trap'. In the case of delay, once you move the fuse will go out.


* To maximize points, draw narrow, tall boxes, like fingers, from the bottom.  When the Qix goes down between two fingers, go across the top of the fingers at slow speed. This tactic permits percentages of up to 99%.


* It is possible create a 'slide-box' to avoid the sparks. Starting at a corner of a box, draw another box that connects only at that corner. When a spark approaches, the player can slide the diamond through the intersection, while the spark has to go around the perimeter. After the spark passes the intersection, the player can slide back across the intersection and be behind the spark.

- TRIVIA -


Released in December 1982.


Quantum was the first Atari game to allow a player to try the game without inserting a coin. During the attract mode, the game allowed the player to move the comet to try to capture a particle. During this mode, the messages 'TRY CAPTURING THIS ATOM' and 'MOVE THE TRACKBALL'.


Quantum was also the first game to allow player to 'draw' his name with the trackball when he gets the high score.


Quantum was designed by General Computer for Atari as part of a lawsuit settlement for a "Missile Command" speedup kit to which they affixed their copyright.


Quantum was released in very limited quantities. Atari employees have said that there were 500 or fewer games produced. The original price was $2,095.


- SCORING -


Electron : 20 points.

Triphon : 100 points.

Splitter : 100 points.

Photon : 200 points.

Positron : 200 points.

Tryd : 300 points.

Nucleus : 300 points.

Pulsar : 400 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Once you capture a particle (or anything), you should keep circling it. You can keep capturing it over and over until you get tired. For 4x the score, you can apply this trick to two particles at once. Obviously this trick is easier to do on the very early levels.


* White particles always move vertically, while colored particles always move diagonally. Knowing this may make capturing them easier.


* If the player earns the highest score, a special option allows them to sign their name using the trackball, as well as enter their initials into the high score table.

Quartet (c) 1986 Sega.


A platform shoot-em-up hybrid from Sega for one to four players, selected from either Joe (yellow), Mary (red), Lee (blue) and Edgar (green). The action takes place over a number of sideways scrolling levels, the bulk of which consist of straightforward platform action. On some levels, however, there are jet packs for the players to collect, and the gameplay's emphasis switched to that of a standard, sideways scrolling shoot-em-up.


The object of the game is to destroy an army of robots that have taken over an Earth colony satellite station. Each level has a boss character that must be destroyed. Upon its death it releases a door key that must be used to exit the level. Weapon and character power-ups can be collected to aid players in their task.


Due to its potential for four-player shoot-em-up gameplay, Quartet's gameplay feels vaguely similar to (though by no means as accomplished as) Atari's 1985 classic, "Gauntlet".

Based on the Neo-Geo fighting game series. The six playable characters are split two each from SNK's three fighting franchises (at the time). They are :

"Art of Fighting" : Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia

"Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" : Terry Bogard and Mai Shiranui

"Samurai Shodown" : Haohmaru and Nakoruru


Of these six, Mai is the only one not to appear in the first game of their respective series (Mai debuted in "Fatal Fury 2"). Other characters from these three series appear as the people asking the questions or otherwise standing in the way. The exception is Yuri Sakazaki, of course, as the entire premise of this game is the six of them having to save her.

R-Type (c) 1987 Irem.


A legendary game that revolutionized the genre and completely changed the way players viewed the humble shoot'em up. R-Type is an incredibly difficult game but, due to the superb graphics, breath-taking level design and never-before-seen gameplay, the game was a huge success, and is still regarded as being the finest of its genre.


R-type's real stroke of genius was in the innovative weapon system the game introduced. The first is the beam weapon : when the player presses and holds the fire button, a beam 'power meter' starts to charge up, once the meter was full, releasing the fire button unleashed a very powerful 'plasma burst', capable of destroying most of R-type's enemy ships. The trade-off was that charging the weapon took up valuable seconds, giving the Bydo ships time to attack.


The second and perhaps most significant innovation was R-type's now-legendary 'Force Pod'. This takes the form of an invincible, detachable laser-firing pod that can be attached to either the front or rear of the player's ship, or can be detached completely and sent forth into the enemy ships. The pod laser was a stroke of true genius and, coupled with the superb level design, gave the world its first 'strategic' shoot'em up.

Licensed to Nintendo for US manufacture and distribution.


R-Type is one of the most famous of all scrolling shooters. Its impressive graphics, detailed animation, inventive features and simple yet surprisingly involved gameplay made it a huge success for Irem.


The first boss, as well as some of the stages, seem inspired by the artistic works of H. R. Giger (of 'Aliens' fame). He makes a brief cameo in the TV sets in "Undercover Cops".


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (R-Type : Irem Game Music - 28XA-199) on 25/01/1988.


- UPDATES -


At the title screen, the prototype version says 'Play and enjoy the game' instead of 'Blast off and strike the evil Bydo empire!', as it does in the final version.

The inevitable sequel to the hugely-successful original finds the evil Bydo Empire once again intent on the destruction of all mankind. The infamous Beam Weapon and Pod Laser make a welcome return, as do the beautifully rendered, organic-looking levels. R-type II doesn't do anything that the original didn't do, but the sequel is every bit as good as its illustrious predecessor, with the same tight gameplay and imaginative level design that made R-type such a classic - although R-Type II is, if anything, more difficult than its already-unforgiving prequel.

R-Type Leo (c) 12/1992 Irem.


The third and final arcade release of this classic series (which would foster three further console-only sequels, see 'Series' for details) sees the Bydo Empire waging a full scale assault against other planets. 


R-Type Leo possesses many of the elements that made the first two games in the series such classics, but the feel and gameplay is very different. Both the beam laser and the pod make a return, but play a different role in this game. The pod in particular now acts more like a mini 'smart bomb', in that it only detaches from the player's ship for a few seconds, and automatically homes in on enemies. The level design is also far more open than that of its predecessors, and far more forgiving.


R-Type Leo is a game that firmly divides opinions of fans of the series. Some considered it to be a blasphemy to the R-Type name, arguing that in making a game far more 'traditional', both in feel and level design, R-type Leo actually represented a step backwards from what the innovative original achieved. Less patient players undoubtedly prefer Leo's open levels and forgiving gameplay. Something that all can agree on, however, is how stunningly beautiful the game is. The detail and use of colour on both the backgrounds and enemy ships is incredible and is one of the finest examples of two-dimensional artwork the arcade has ever seen.

Licensed to Bally / Midway / Sente for US distribution.


This game is known in Japan as "Rabio Lepus".


The main character appears as a secret character in "Aero Fighters 3".


- UPDATES -


Cut scenes from the original Rabio Lepus were eliminated in Rabbit Punch. These include a picture appearing when the spaceship flies out of the castle at the start, pictures when the two bunny girls and Rabbit King are rescued and scenes at the ending.


Also, in Rabbit Punch you can't buy in during the final 4 levels and when you use a continue, even if you were in stage 12, you have to start all the way back at the start of stage 9. In Rabio Lepus you can continue at any time, even on stage 12 without being sent back to stage 9. This makes the US version much more difficult and nearly impossible to finish compared to the Japanese version.

Radar Scope (c) 1980 Nintendo.


- TECHNICAL -


Radar Scope was available in 3 different dedicated cabinets. The upright cabinet was the same design used for the "Donkey Kong" series. It was red in color and had sticker side-art of a spaceship. The monitor bezel and control panel were designed to mimic the view from inside the cockpit of a spaceship. While the marquee showed an image of a blue and red 'Radar Scope' logo on a field of stars. The cocktail version came in a white-topped cabinet and was only decorated with an instruction card underneath the glass. The final version was a big environmental unit that completely enclosed the player inside (to better hear all that 'Laser Sound'). All the Radar Scope advertisements showed the environmental version. It used the same side-art as the upright, and had a 'Radar Scope' logo silk-screened on the back window. All versions used a 'Nintendo Compatible' Sanyo monitor.

Released in November 1980. This was the first game that Shigeru Miyamoto worked on, and it did not sell very well. Of the 3,000 games made, roughly 2,000 were converted into "Donkey Kong". This lead to two variations of Donkey Kong cabinets : the harder to find red cabinet and the traditional blue cabinet.

Rainbow Islands - The Story of Bubble Bobble 2 (c) 1987 Taito.


Rainbow Islands is a sequel to the legendary "Bubble Bobble" - released a year earlier - and has attained the same legendary status as that of its illustrious predecessor.


1 or 2 players (who, unlike 'Bubble Bobble', no longer play simultaneously) take on the role of Bub and Bob who, after their success in Bubble Bobble, have now been returned to their original human form. The heroes have been asked to rescue the Rainbow Islands from the clutches of the various enemies who have overrun the islands. Bob and Bob are each armed with the ability to create rainbows; an ingenious game-play device that acts as both a weapon (to either kill an enemy instantly, or an enemy then collapse the rainbow onto it, this is essential for collecting bonus gems, (see 'Tips and Tricks' for details) and as a platform that allows the players to reach previously inaccessible parts of the level as they race to reach the top of the island before the game's tight time limit expires.


A number of power-ups are available to the players; including multiple rainbows (up to a maximum of three), faster generating rainbows, speed-up shoes and temporary invulnerability. Rainbow Islands is famous for its multitude of hidden secrets, see 'Tips and Tricks' for details.


Rainbow Islands consists of 7 levels, each with 4 rounds. Holding down the jump button will allow the player to jump onto rainbows without crushing them.

- TRIVIA -


The main characters are Bub and Bob, the protagonists of "Bubble Bobble". However, in this game they appear in human forms, as opposed to the dinosaurs of the first game. In single-player mode, only Bub is present.


The fifth island, DOH Island, is a homage to the game "Arkanoid", also by Taito. This level plays as any other, but the enemies are the same as encountered in "Arkanoid", and the platforms are designed from colored blocks. Also, the music is absent and the player's jumping sound resembles the sound of the ball hitting the bat in "Arkanoid". Losing the final life in this island also results in the Game Over music from "Arkanoid" instead of the usual Rainbow Islands music. The boss on DOH Island is DOH himself, the boss of "Arkanoid".


The game soundtrack features a brief excerpt from 'Somewhere over the Rainbow', which has meant that later ports of the game have different music, as the license expired some time ago.


An extra version of this game was released in 1988 (Game ID : B39, see Updates section for more info).


A bootleg of this game called "Jumping" was released in 1989.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The Ninja Warriors : G.S.M. Taito 1 - D28B0001) on 21/06/1988.


- UPDATES -


The extra version has the exact same game-play as the original but the stages and bosses appear in a different order.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* One of Rainbow Island's most infamous and difficult-to-achieve bonuses is that of collecting one of each of the colored gems (red, orange, yellow, green, light blue, dark blue and mauve). Gems are awarded when a player collapses a rainbow onto certain enemies and the color of the gem awarded is dictated by WHERE on the screen the enemy is when it's killed. The screen is split into several invisible vertical 'bands' of color; when a gem falls, its color is determined by the 'color' of the area into which it fell. Now all you have to do is gauge carefully where the dead enemy will fall to create the gem color of your choice.


* Title Screen Cheats : These codes can be typed in at the title screen (while the rainbow is cycling through its colors). They are given to you in the secret rooms and give you the effect of the item in that room if you use them. When you put your coin in, an item should appear in the bottom left corner, depending on which cheat you used. This not only awards you the life and Bonus Gem, it also grants you access to a magical secret room. When you reach the end of the level, a silver door appears. You DON'T have to fight the Boss.

Rally-X (c) 1980 Namco.


In Rally-X, the player drives a car around a maze picking up all of the yellow flags, of which there are 10, before the car's fuel runs out. The game-play has a similar feel to another Namco legend, "Pac-Man"; although in Rally-X's mazes are much larger and, with each maze having only 10 flags to collect, is more sparsely populated than Namco's pill-eating legend.


In-game opponents consist of red enemy cars that try to ram into and destroy the player's car, a problem compounded by the fact that enemy cars are faster than the player's. A smoke screen can be activated which trails behind the player's car and causes any pursuing enemies to crash. Each maze also has rock formations which, if crashed into, will result in the loss of a player car. A radar display to the right hand side of the playing area shows the positions of both the flags, and the enemy vehicles.

Released in October 1980.


Also licensed to Midway (January 1981).


In 1980 "Defender", "Pac-Man", and "Battlezone" were shown alongside Rally-X at a trade show sponsored by the Amusement Machine Operators of America. It was believed that Rally-X would be the top money-earner. Defender went on to sell more than 60,000 units-more than disproving these projections-and cemented its place in video game history.


A Rally-X unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Tron'.


- UPDATES -


In the introduction to the bonus stages, the Namco version misspells 'Challenging' as 'Charanging'. This was corrected in the Midway version.


- SCORING -


Collecting a flag : 100 points x the flag collected up to a maximum of 1,000 points.

Special Flag : Doubles points for all flags collected. If collected first, the last flag is worth 2,000 points.

Rampage (c) 1986 Bally Midway.


RAMPAGE displays giant all-powerful creatures fighting for survival in various city environments, against a continuous onslaught of National Guard and police forces! Each player becomes one of these mighty warriors capable of collapsing skyscrapers into dust and rubble. All 3 of the creatures are human mutations : an ape (George), a lizard (Lizzie), and a wolf-like creature (Ralph).


The game can be played by 1, 2 or 3 people. In a 1-player game, one creature character is controlled by the person playing the game while the National Guard and police forces are controlled by the game itself. In turn, each additional player controls an additional creature character.


Each player controls his character with a joystick, a Jump button (which is also a Game Start button), and a Punch/grab button. Using the joystick, the player character can move left, right, up, or down (4 directions only). Hitting the Jump button while using the joystick enables the character to jump in any of four directions. Hitting the Punch/grab button enables the character to punch and/or grab in any of four directions. On the control panel are three sets of these controls : left side (George), center (Lizzie), and right side (Ralph).


Game play begins for any one player when, after inserting proper coinage, he presses the Jump button of the character of his choice (only one character for each player per game). Three separate newspaper 'datelines' appear on the screen, one for each creature. These 'datelines' reappear after every rack. Only 'datelines' for ACTIVE player characters will display information: 1) the day - number (may or may not appear) which indicates the rack number, 2) the name of the city environment, and 3) a message about the creature or a game play hint. Next, the city environment appears on the screen, mainly consisting of high-rise buildings, and now the battle begins. The player character appears in the city where it is attacked by the National Guard and police forces with massive firepower. It must run, jump, climb buildings, and punch its enemies to stay alive until the end of the rack.


In this initial rack, hazards to the player character are mainly: 1) National Guard helicopters with machine guns and 2) police swat team members moving from window to window of the buildings using rifles and throwing sticks of dynamite. Every time it is damaged, by getting punched, shot, shocked, or by falling or by being on a collapsed building, it loses 'power'. This is measured by a 'damage' gauge for each creature at the top of the screen. When the gauge reads empty, the mutant creature shrinks back to its human form which then creeps off of the screen. At this point, the game allows the player a time limit to "buy back in" to preserve his rack position. Provided as a game option, the game operator may also allow the player a short time limit to "buy back in" to protect his point total. If the player "buys in" in time, before the human form leaves the screen, then it will grow into being the creature again. If not, then the same creature will drop back in from a dirigible. Beyond the time limit the game is over for the player.


However, the rack itself ends ONLY when all of the buildings have been destroyed (either by the creature or by swat team members placing charges of dynamite at the base of each building). If the creature has survived to this point, then the game advances to the next rack. If the player character survives to the end of the rack, the power loss is carried over to the next rack. The player scores points by punching or eating the creature's enemies and also by destroying buildings. But due to the continuous power drain caused by damage, the player character MUST find and eat food to restore its power level. By punching holes in the buildings, the player MAY find Food (increased power), Bonuses (points) or Hazards (decreased power).


EXAMPLES

Food : Milk, Turkey, Hot Toast

Bonus : Flower Pot, TV Set, Money Bag

Hazard : Cactus, Poison, Toaster


The types of Hazards and Bonuses found OUTSIDE of buildings vary and may increase in difficulty in succeeding 'city environment' racks.


EXAMPLES

Bonus : Auto (or Truck), Commuter Train, Person in Manhole

Hazard : National Guard Tank, Police Car, Storm Cloud


Another source of game points comes from the player character grabbing a fleeing 'townie' from a building window. Two benefits : 1) While holding the 'townie', all swat team members disappear from the building windows and 2) accumulating points are scored during the time the townie is held.


For the continuous buy-in feature, hundreds of racks 'city environments', have been created.

Released in October 1986.


Rampage incorporates Bally Midway's JOIN THE ACTION feature : each set of game controls includes a corresponding start (Jump) button, which is activated independently. This allows a person, after inserting the proper coinage, to begin play at any time including while the other sets of game controls are in use.


Ramapage has an impressive 768 different levels. The 128th level of the game is 'Plano, Illinois', and was the only level in the game with less than three buildings. Brian, one of the designers, said : Plano Illinois was only two buildings because Plano Il is a Tiny town, in which my partner Jeff was born and raised.


These are the random headlines you may encounter during the game. These headlines appear when the next day begins :

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


You start the game with your monsters at the bottom of the screen. After the game starts, it is time for you to start the 'urban renewal' process.


* After you start, you will start being attacked. There is no real way to avoid a lot of the attacks by the National Guardsmen due to the sheer volume of fire they are laying down. Your best bet is to keep moving and make yourself a hard target to hit.


* To move quickly from building to building, jump toward the building and push up to grab the building. This enables you to use your monster's ability to both jump and climb at the same time.


* To relieve some pressure from the National Guardsmen, climb up the buildings and smash the windows where they pop out from or just eat them when they are leaning out the window. Move quickly since their buddies are still shooting or throwing dynamite at your monster.


* Unless you are totally obsessed with points, let the National Guardsmen do your work for you. A great example of this is that about midway through a day, a National Guard-man will rush out from the side of the screen with explosives. They will place them at the base of a building. This demolishes the building and helps you along to the next day.


* Another way to destroy buildings is to weaken it up, then jump on the roof. Your monster's weight will cause the building to collapse.


* The air units can be rather dangerous. During the beginning days, the helicopters will overfly your monster, turn around, and then dive in for the attack. You can destroy the helicopters when they are coming in to prevent their attack. Also, when you are moving around, you make it harder for them to get a bead on your monster.


* During the later days, helicopters will drop bombs. Again, paying attention to everything that is going on will allow you to easily escape the bomb being dropped. You can also entice the helicopter to drop a bomb when you are on top of a building. When the bomb is dropped, jump out of the way and let the bomb do the damage to the building for you.


* Make sure that you either grab the food or eat the National Guardsmen to keep your health up. If you can hold out for 128 days, you will get all of your health restored for that day and days 256, 384, 512, 640, and 768. Also keep in mind that if you punch too fast, you may end up getting something that will harm your monster.


* Paratroopers can be a particular pain. If you plan to attack a building with a Paratrooper unit on it, make sure you quickly scale the building and eat said unit. It makes life a lot easier since their rapid fire can put a major hurting on your monster.


* Ground units such as Tanks and Police Cars can be a real nuisance. They fire some pretty heavy shells which not only cause a lot of damage, but they also can knock back your monster for quite a distance. There are some ways to combat these units :

1) Climb quickly up a building. When the unit passes below you, jump down and give it a good punch.

2) Time the shots and rush the ground unit in-between shots to get a good punch in.

3) Use available weapons such as manhole covers, flower pots, or safes to drop on them. These things also allow you to hit them at a distance.


* Be sure and watch what your monster grabs at. There are a lot of hazards in the buildings and it is pretty bad when your monster buys the farm doing dumb stuff such as grabbing electrical items such as toasters and light bulbs.


* In addition to the above, dynamite is sometimes in the middle of buildings. When uncovered, you have about two to three seconds to get your monster out of there before they are blown off the building. Eating it will only decrease your monster's health so run far away when it is uncovered.

Rampage - World Tour (c) 1997 Midway Games.


A sequel to the 1986 original, Rampage World Tour once again has George, Lizzie, and Ralph bent on a trail of destruction. The 'World Tour' of the title refers to the fact that the action now takes place around the entire world, instead of just North America. Graphics are much improved and a KICK button has been added to allow even more chaos.


Hidden bonus items have also been added to the game; two examples are an item that allows any player character to transport to almost any location in the game instantly. A second gives the players more destructive power. Some stages have a vat of toxic chemicals that can mutate any player character into a huge purple bat-like creature called V.E.R.N (Violently Enraged Radioactive Nemesis) for the duration of the stage.

- TRIVIA -


Released in March 1997.


Developed by 'Game Refuge' (see Staff section for more info).


RWT was born during a meeting, (regarding another project), between Game Refuge Designers Brian Colin and Jeff Nauman and top Midway execs Ken Fedesna and the late, great, Joe Dillon. Marketing VP Joe Dillon made an off-hand comment : "What we really need is a game that appeals to everyone... adults as well as kids, girls as much as guys. My partner, Jeff Nauman, and I looked at each other and said, in unison, 'Then lets re-make RAMPAGE!'. Five minutes later we got the green light to make the game".


It was decided to remake the game using the latest Midway Wolf Unit hardware. All of the character animation was achieved through the use of the 3D spline-modeling tool Animation Master.


A sequel, "Rampage - Universal Tour" was canceled as an arcade project.


Stages trivia : There are 130 regular racks/levels in RWT. Each rack is a unique city, and the passage of time is counted in Days (1 day = 1 city). In addition, there are 14 'Transcontinental Flights'; a bonus flying rack in which players chalk up special bonuses. There are are 4 'Grudge Match' racks that pit player against player for an enormous point bonus. The final levels are on the surface of the moon, against hoardes of heavily armed Scumlab astronauts. There are 'hidden' racks as well, in such unlikely places as 'Hades' (complete with Demonic Minions) (...told you Scumlabs had underworld connections), 'Secret Government Area 69' (So thats where all those aliens keep coming from!) and the terrifying, mystical wasteland known only as 'Suburbia', to name a few.


In some stage you are attacked by ed-209 from 'Robocop'!


There are several humorous touches in the game. Like sometimes if your character eats a person, he will spit him out shortly if that person didn't taste good.

Rampart (c) 1990 Atari Games.


A superb arcade puzzle game in which up to three players must build up a castle using Tetris shaped pieces to form a castle wall and enclose their keep. Each player must then place a limited number of cannons inside their castle wall before the timer expires. Once the cannons have been placed the battle itself begins. Players must target their cannons onto the enemy's castle (or, in the one-player game, enemy ships and peons) and destroy as much of the enemy army as possible before the time limit expires.


Once the battle is over the players must repair their castles, again using tetris shapes. The players' Keep must be completely encircled with castle wall or the game is over. In the single-player sea attack game, any enemy ships that manage to reach the coast nearest the player will unload peons that will attack the player's castle by land.

Rastan (c) 1987 Taito.


A platform hack 'n' slash game from Taito in which a single player guides a barbarian hero through a number of fantasy-themed levels, fighting through swathes of mythological fantasy creatures, including orcs, skeletal warriors and multi-headed hydra.


More powerful weapons can be picked up, as well as bonus items that can increase the barbarian hero's health and give increased protection against enemy attack. Players should be wary that some collectable items are cursed and will have a detrimental effect on the hero's health and performance. Unlimited continues are available throughout the game.

- TRIVIA -


Released in March 1987.


This game is known in Japan as "Rastan Saga".


Rastan was inspired by the 'Conan the barbarian' saga novels, by Robert E Howard. In the background of the first stage, giant stone statues can be seen that bear more than a passing resemblance to the statues that featured in 'The Lord of The Rings - Fellowship of the Ring'. While the film appeared several years AFTER Rastan, the famous LotR concept artwork that featured in the deluxe addition of the book had been available for some time.


The main character, Rastan, appears as a selectable character, ''Miracle Rastan'', in "Champion Wrestler".


The game contains several bonus items that are not normally dropped by enemies : A golden armature, a brown scroll and a yellow scroll. Graphics for these can be seen in the tile-sets and modifications to game's data tables can cause them to be dropped. The golden armature acts like the existing armature, the scrolls do nothing.


The game contains a built in test mode, activated by the value of two bytes towards the end of the code roms. Invincibility can be selected, causing 'NO-HIT' to be displayed at the bottom of the title screen. The starting level can also be modified.


The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high-score table. If you try, they get changed to 'AHA'.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Kyukyoku Tiger : G.S.M. Taito 2 - D28B0008) on 21/11/1988.

Zuntata Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Zuntata History L'ab-normal 1st - ZTTL-0038) on 01/04/1999.


- UPDATES -


"Rastan Saga" has some differences :

* In the attract mode appears the intro (instead the description of the objects).

* If you waste too many time without advancing in the stage, only 2 bats will attack you (instead of 8).

* If you die on the final stage, the game ends and you cannot continue; this means that the entire final level must be completed on a SINGLE credit. In order to make this even remotely possible you should deliberately die at the end of the fifth stage while fighting the boss (a multi-headed dragon). You should then use another credit to continue and defeat the dragon with your first man (with as little damage as possible). If you cannot defeat him with the first man and little damage, kill off the remaining men and start with a fresh credit. Always go after the special weapons where possible; if special weapons run out, jumping and striking doubles the damage done with the sword. Pushing up and the jump button will jump higher than pushing the jump button alone.


* The game attract sequence does not reveal the purpose of the rod. If you are carrying it, killing an enemy of any type causes all other on-screen enemies of the same type to die.


* If you are going for a high-score, always 'pick-up' the poisons. They are worth a lot of points.


* The ring can always be obtained in the first level castle. Proceed past the 3 ropes, down the next long chain and then up the next long chain. Slowly nudge this chain offscreen and two enemies appear on the left-hand side, one of which always carries the ring.


* Chains in castles can often be traversed upwards much quicker by repeatedly jumping against a nearby wall. Others needing to be traversed downwards can be missed by jumping off and falling. The level 4 boss is virtually impossible to defeat unless this tactic is used, in order to meet him carring the hammer.


* Repeated high vertical jumps are a good method to use to 'stall', when on slopes approaching bouncing fireballs.


* Many players don't know that the 'mud' first encountered on level 2 does not actually kill you, it just causes you to sink down requiring many quick jumps to get out.

Rastan Saga (c) 1987 Taito.


A platform hack 'n' slash game in which a single player guides a barbarian hero through a number of fantasy-themed levels, fighting through swathes of mythological fantasy creatures, including orcs, skeltal warriors and multi-headed hydra. More powerful weapons can be picked up as well as bonus items which can increase the barbarian hero's health and give increased protection against enemy attack. Players should be wary that some collectable items are cursed and will have a detrimental effect on the hero's health and performance. Unlimited continues are available throughout the game.

- TRIVIA -


This game is known outside Japan as "Rastan".


Rastan was inspired by 'Conan the barbarian' saga books. In the first stage in the background you can see the same statue as in the movie 'The Lord of The Rings'; as the film appeared several years AFTER Rastan Saga, this may be complete co-incidence.


The main character, Rastan, appears as a selectable characters, 'Miracle Rastan', in "Champion Wrestler".

- UPDATES -

* In the attract mode appears the intro (instead the description of the objects).

* If you waste too many time without advancing in the stage, only 2 bats will attack you (instead of 8).

Released in December 1995.


This game is known in Japan as "Real Bout Garou Densetsu" (translates from Japanese as 'Real Bout Hungry Wolf Legend').


Things that changed in this particular game :

* The game uses a different 4 button setup this time around (punch, kick, power attack & plane switch) This was done to make the plane change mechanics easier to master.

* Chain combos are easier to pull this time around as well.

* This is one of the very few 2-D fighters to feature ring outs!

* Newcomers in the game are : Kim Kaphwan, Duck King & Billy Kane.


Pony Canyon released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Real Bout Garou Densetsu - PCCB-00203) on 07/02/1996.

- TRIVIA -


Released in March 1998.


This game is known in Japan as "Real Bout Garou Densetsu 2 - The Newcomers" (translates from Japanese as 'Real Bout Hungry Wolf Legend 2 - The Newcomers').


Things that changed in this particular game :

* The game now features 'single plane' stages (like the ones seen in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters", "Fatal Fury 2" & "Fatal Fury Special") in which you can slam enemies against background objects!

* The breakable objects system seen in Real Bout Special is gone. Also the "evil character" versions of some characters are gone as well.

* Newcomers in this game are : Li Xiangfei, Rick Strowd & Alfred.


A serious bug : Using a USA bios ROM if you insert a coin on the 'winners don't use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tile-set rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the main-board z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attract loop after game-over, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Fight against Alfred : Begin game play in single player mode, finish off the first 10 fights with no Losses, score over 750000 by the time the 10th fight is won, land 5 Super Dead Move's or 7 Dead Move's. You will fight Alfred in a desert type stage.


* You may scope out each character's best records by tapping A button to move forward or B button to move back at the score ranking screen :).

Even if the copyright year is 1996, this game was released to the public in January 1997.


This game is known in Japan as "Real Bout Garou Densetsu Special" (translates from Japanese as 'Real Bout Hungry Wolf Legend Special').


Things that changed in this particular game :

* The game modifies the plane switching system a bit.

* Ring out system is modified into the instant dizzy system (By breaking background objects!).

* Newcomers in the game are Tung Fu Rue, Lawrence Blood & Wolfgang Krauser. 'Evil' versions of some characters are available as well.

- UPDATES -


MVS (Arcade) vs. AES (Neo-Geo) differences :

On the AES (Neo-Geo) Geese is a playable character by imputing a code. On the MVS (Arcade) version he was removed as a playable character for being too strong.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Play as Shadow/EX Fighter : Shadow/EX fighter is an evil version of the selected character with a different move-list set as well as a different ending than his/her original counterpart. This code only works with the following characters : Andy Bogard, Billy Kane, Blue Mary, Tung Fu Rue.

1) At the character selection screen, highlight the character of your choice, hold Start and press B(x2), C(x2).

2) While continuing to hold Start, hold B, pause one second and hold C.

3) While continuing to hold Start+B+C, press A or D to select the Shadow version of the character.

4) Pressing A or D will select a different color.


* Fight against Geese Howard : Begin game play in single player mode, win all rounds, do not score less than a 'B' rank in any battle and get more than 750,000 points befire fighting Wolfgang Krauser. You will fight Geese Howard in a special 'Nightmare' match.


* You can see different sets of funny outtakes during the credits if you consecutively beat the game 5 or 6 times before they start to repeat themselves.

Red Alert (c) 1981 Irem.


FIRST ATTACK IN DAYLIGHT - BOMBERS IN FORMATION WITH ATTACKING AIRCRAFT. This sequence is introduced both audibly and visually : Red alert. Enemy aircraft approaching. 20 jet fighters approaching. Destroy all fighters by 11:00 hours, or MIRV will be launched.

In this sequence, bombers in formation move from left to right across the screen, and then from right to left, etc. During the attack, some break formation and attack the launcher. The aircraft drop bombs in an attempt to hit the launcher. Also during the attack, a special red colored aircraft flying above the aircraft formation appears and drops a red colored megaton bomb that slowly descends on the country. When hours reach 11:00, present fighter attack is interrupted by a flashing CAUTION on screen, followed by appearance of the MIRV.

The MIRV slowly descends, then breaks up into several bombs. They, in turn, also break up into several bombs. As a result, a shower of bombs slowly descends on the country.

Player participation during the attack is to destroy all aircraft by firing rocket launcher. During the attack, player is to avoid direct hits by bombs - each of which costs him one rocket launcher. Also during the attack, the player must destroy the red bomb before it lands, or one rocket launcher is destroyed.

When MIRV appears, player must destroy it completely - otherwise the landing of any one will cost the player one launcher.


SECOND ATTACK BY HELICOPTERS - DROPPING PARACHUTE BOMBS. Introduced by : Helicopter squadron attacking! Destroy helicopters by 16:00 hours, or MIRV will be launched.

Player participation during attack is to destroy all aircraft by firing rocket launcher. During the attack, player is to keep his launcher away from red areas created by exploding bombs - or lose a launcher. Both helicopters and bombs may be destroyed by rockets. However, if the parachute, but not the bomb, is hit, the deflated parachute will drop the bomb much faster.

MIRV attack, if launched, is a repeat of the first sequence above.


THIRD ATTACK AT NIGHT - HEAVY BOMBERS IN FORMATION. Introduced by : Red alert.  Night attack by bombers.

The player is aided by two searchlights. The object is to destroy all aircraft. When all aircraft are destroyed, game progresses to next frame (country). During the attack, the player must avoid direct hits by bombs. No time limit is imposed. No MIRV will be launched.


GAME FRAMES. Game repeats above cycles through the following countries, respectively : FRANCE, USA, ITALY, GREAT BRITAIN, GERMANY, and JAPAN. However, as the game progresses from frame to frame, the action of the game is stepped up.


HOW LAUNCHERS ARE LOST. Rocket launchers are lost by :

* A direct hit by a dropped bomb

* Red bomb dropped by red plane lands anywhere

* Launcher is in red area created by exploding parachute bomb

* MIRV lands anywhere

Suddenly out of the horizon, an enemy biplane appears. The pilot dives, climbs, lines up the plane in his sights! He fires a deadly hail of tracers and the enemy airplane tumbles to earth.


But watch out, there are more coming. The first four planes are relatively slow. As time progresses, the player moves more quickly and the enemy planes take more evasive action, adding to the difficulty and challenge.


Next the player faces ground targets. An observation blimp floats into view over a low rise of hills. Bright ground objects start to appear, a tank, a pill-box, then dimmer targets, a pyramid, a building. They make good targets for strafing runs but danger can appear at any time.


As the game progresses, tanks, pill-boxes and blimps will begin shooting back.  The game is composed of randomly alternating series of ground and plane phases. Finally, the planes will also shoot at the player.


There are other dangers too.  Dive too low and the player can crash and explode on a mountain. Squeeze the trigger too long and the guns overheat. And an enemy plane can get on the pilot's tail, almost certain death unless the player is a flying ace.


When a player is hit by a returning plane, bullet holes and cracks appear on the screen, his plane plummets to earth and explodes. If an enemy shell finds its mark, the result is the same but the shell remains visible.

- TRIVIA -


Released in May 1980.


Also released as "Red Baron [Cockpit model]".


Red Baron was designed to accurately recreate World War I aerial combat. It was definitely the first flight simulator available to the public back in 1980. Red Baron was a lot like "Battlezone" in the air. Which made a lot of sense, because Red Baron ran on almost exactly the same hardware as Battlezone (more information below), and most Red Baron Upright machines shipped in factory converted Battlezone cabinets (they usually even have Battle Zone sideart underneath the red 'Iron Cross' sideart). Unfortunately this game never did as well as Battlezone did, the game did poorly in the arcades, approximately 2,000 units were produced. Maybe the world just wasn't ready for a 3-D flight simulator?


Red Baron used almost the exact same hardware as Battlezone, but not quite. Battlezone will run on Red Baron hardware with a few minor modifications, but Red Baron will not run on Battlezone hardware without a Red Baron 'auxiliary board', as the Battlezone auxiliary board did not have enough sockets for all the Red Baron ROM chips. The 2 games control completely different though.


- SCORING -


Enemy Fighter : 300 to 10 points. When the enemy fighter first appears, it is worth 300 points. The closer it gets to your plane, the less the enemy plane is worth.

Blimp : 200 points

Tanks : 250 points

Pillboxes : 250 points

Pyramids : 100 points

Buildings : 100 points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, you will be put into a surrealistic landscape. The view is from the cockpit of your bi-plane. Immediately, you will be jumped on by enemy units. You will know an enemy unit has appeared because of the sounds the game makes. The joystick is pretty sensitive. This basically means you don't have to push it hard in order to get your plane to move around. Also, remember that the game is set up like an actual plane.


* Try to keep your altitude as high as possible. This gives you a better chance at 'jumping' enemy air units. In addition, it will allow you to be able to keep with them longer ensuring a better chance at a kill.


* If there are no enemy planes around, you can go on strafing missions to take out a few of the enemy ground units. Be very careful when you are doing this since the terrain is pretty mountainous.


* At the beginning, you will only encounter one enemy plane. As you progress through the game, don't be surprised when you get attacked by three or even four enemy planes at one time.


* Learn how to do deflection shooting. Deflection shooting is a method of shooting where you fire your shots in front of the projected path of the object you are trying to hit. In essence, it forces that object to ''run'' into your fire.


* Practice doing evasive maneuvering starting with the basic dives and climbs. Then add turns to these moves. This will definitely come in very handy later on in the game when you are confronted with a large number of enemy units (both ground and air).


* You will see the enemy fire that is aimed at your plane. The bullets look like diamonds. They are easy to evade but you may have to do some tight turns if there is a heavy volume of enemy fire coming at your plane.


* If you don't take out an enemy plane while it is heading for your plane, it will get behind you. This presents a very dangerous situation since you will only have a couple of seconds before you are shot down. You can evade the enemy plane :

a) If you are too close to the ground, immediately climb and roll to the left or right. By doing this, you actually cause your plane to slow down and the enemy plane flies under you giving you another opportunity to shoot him down.

b) If you are too high, then you can power dive and roll left or right. Just watch out for the ground (which will be coming at you fast). Before you get to the ground, do a power climb and follow the advice in the first part.


* Blimps present a unique challenge since they don't move very fast. This means you will need to take them down on your first pass since you travel much faster then them. Sometimes the blimp will present you with a ''head-on'' look. This makes it harder to hit since it makes itself into a smaller target.


* While 'hunting' for enemy air units, it's usually a good idea to do a gentle roll from side-to-side. The reason for this is if you get multiple enemy air units, you can fire off a burst and knock more then one out of the sky. This helps even the odds up considerably.


* Don't keep your finger on the gun trigger too long. Your guns will overheat and it takes a couple of seconds for them to cool off again. That couple seconds could be the difference between life and death.

Renegade (c) 12/1986 Technos.


An incredibly difficult but classic beat-em-up from Technos that sees a single player taking on huge gangs of street fighters. The game is spread across four stages levels, each of which is only 2 or 3 screens wide; giving the player nowhere to hide. Renegade was a rather more brutal game than others of its genre, and even allowed the player to keep attacking a downed enemy. It was also possible to pick up fallen enemies and throw them at oncoming fighters.


Renegade's designer would take what they learned while designing and writing Renegade and improve upon it in every conceivable way for the legendary "Double Dragon", released a year later.

Apollon Music released a limited-edition soundtrack album (Cassette format) for this game (Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun Sound Story) on 05/1987.


- UPDATES -


Western version of "Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun". The game's graphics were redrawn for the game's localization as Renegade to the game's characters and settings a western feel. The plot was also changed from beating up numerous gangs who are bullying the main character's best friend to rescuing the main character's girlfriend. Kunio, the main character in the Japanese, would return in numerous games including "Nekketsu Koukou Dodgeball-bu", the Japanese version of "Super Dodge Ball", some which underwent a similar localization process when they were released in the west (such as the NES game River City Ransom).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


On the first 2 levels, try to throw the enemies from the platforms; being careful, of course, to avoid falling from the platform yourself. Also, to kill the third boss, run away from her and hit the kick button (repeat). When fighting the knife gang on the final stage, if you are stabbed even once, you will die. The safest way to defeat them is with dashing punches. Never engage a single enemy or stay one place for too long, otherwise you will be attacked.

* Power-up : After the middle of each stage there's a helicopter (a plane on 1st stage) that drops a power-up item. So, don't destroy it until it releases the power-up. Be careful with the helicopter scrap after destroying it, it can kill you.


* 1up player : At the 2nd and 4th stage there is a chance to pick up a 1up item: a group of blocks appears floating on the upper part of the screen, you have to shoot the blue one. You have to hit it with one shot, if you don't, the blue block will turn to red.


* Moai Statues : be careful with the Moai Statues at the 6th stage (last stage). Always check if its eyes turn red, if it starts blinking it will shoot.

Return of The Jedi (c) 09/1984 Atari.


RETURN OF THE JEDI is a one-player game that features the thrills and excitement of the continuing STAR WARS saga. The new split-wave game-play feature cuts back and forth between two simultaneously occurring action scenes, just like the movie.


RETURN OF THE JEDI is a one-player game. The player controls the actions Of PRINCESS LEIA, CHEWBACCA, and LANDO CALRISSIAN via the flight control. The player's main goal is to destroy the DEATH STAR. To do this, the player must travel through a tube in the DEATH STAR and fire a torpedo into the central reactor.


RETURN OF THE JEDI picks up the action of the movie at the scene where the rebel forces begin their attack on the Imperial DEATH STAR. LUKE SKYWALKER and PRINCESS LEIA race toward a pair of speeder bikes. In this first wave, the player controls LEIA, guiding her through a forest toward the EWOK village. She is pursued by Imperial STORMTROOPERS also riding SPEEDER BIKES. She defends herself by either bumping them off their bikes, or shooting them. Meanwhile, the EWOKS have set up traps to aid LEIA in her flight through the forest of ENDOR. The traps include ropes stretched between trees that the EWOKS pull tight to upend the riders, and logs that the EWOKS push together to crush the SPEEDER BIKES as they pass between them. LEIA can either bump off the STORMTROOPERS or lead them through the traps. The first vehicle through a trap will escape uninjured, but anyone who follows will be destroyed.  


Once the player leaves LEIA safely at the EWOK village, he moves to another part of the forest. During the second wave, the player controls CHEWBACCA who is maneuvering a SCOUT WALKER to the bunker where HAN SOLO is waiting to deactivate the shield protecting the DEATH STAR. CHEWBACCA must shoot or avoid logs, which roll toward him. At the same time, CHEWBACCA must avoid rocks catapulted at his SCOUT WALKER. The player can turn the SCOUT WALKER head using the flight control to achieve better aim while firing at the rocks and logs.


The split-wave effect occurs during waves two and three. The player controls CHEWBACCA in the SCOUT WALKER, and at the same time, controls LANDO CALRISSIAN as he flies the MILLENNIUM FALCON. At crucial moments, the scene will change from the forest of ENDOR to the skies around the DEATH STAR.


While CHEWBACCA is attempting to reach the bunker, LANDO CALRISSIAN is flying the MILLENNIUM FALCON toward the DEATH STAR. LANDO must fight off the IMPERIAL T.I.E. INTERCEPTORS, IMPERIAL STAR CRUISERS, and shuttles. The player maneuvers the FALCON through this traffic, while trying to shoot as many of the Imperial enemies as possible.


As soon as CHEWBACCA gets to the bunker, HAN SOLO blows it up, deactivating the protective shield surrounding the DEATH STAR and clearing the path for the MILLENNIUM FALCON. The MILLENNIUM FALCON must enter the DEATH STAR, travel down a tube toward the reactor, and shoot the central reactor to destroy the DEATH STAR.


The FALCON is pursued by IMPERIAL T.I.E. FIGHTERS while in the tube. LANDO must avoid the pipe walls of the tube and watch out for falling pipes, energy gates, and turrets that shoot at the FALCON. Upon reaching the target, the player must shoot the reactor energy field, then immediately turn around and fly back down the tube. The flight must be rapid because the fireball caused by the explosion pursues the FALCON.


- TECHNICAL -


This particular game was available as both a dedicated upright cabinet and a full scale sit-in cockpit. The cockpit cabinet was rather less widespread than the upright version. The marquee on the more common upright cab featured a 'Return of the Jedi' logo with red letters on a background of stars; with the Millennium Falcon and the Death Star clearly visible. The sideart only covered the top half of the machine. It was a montage of shots that was dominated by a picture of Princess Leia on a speeder bike and a large image of Darth Vader's head.

- TRIVIA -


Return of the Jedi was the second arcade game based on the 'Star Wars' movie franchise despite it being the THIRD film of the trilogy. This Atari title was actually released a full year before 'The Empire Strikes Back'. The films were released in the order; "Star Wars", "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi"; whereas the games were released as "Star Wars", "Return of the Jedi", and "The Empire Strikes Back".


This game is known in Japan as 'Jedi no Fukushuu' (translates from Japanese as 'Revenge of the Jedi').


Return of The Jedi was one of the first games to use a special graphics dithering method to make the graphics look visibly smoother.


This was one of the first Atari titles to modify all game options via a setup menu, rather than by using dip switches. Eighteen years later, the industry still hasn't fully converted over to being 'jumperless'.


All scenes are controlled with a flight yoke that is similar in design to the one used on the vector "Star Wars" game. This is usually the first thing to fail on any given machine. These can be rebuilt fairly easily though, but you may have to do a little bit of hacking to get them to work.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hints :

1) Do not allow enemies to tail you too long. This is how they can destroy you.

2) Lead enemies to the top of the screen, then drop back quickly so you can destroy them.

3) The player must try to be the first through the EWOK traps in the forest of ENDOR.

4) By staying in the center of the screen, the player has more maneuverability.

The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'King of the Ring'.


This game is known outside Japan as "The Main Event".


A number of wrestlers in the game are based on real-life wrestlers.  For instance, Kamikaze Ken is based on Ricky 'The Dragon' Steamboat, Bigfoot Joe is based on King Kong Bundy and Alan the Empire is based on the late Andre the Giant. In another example, Conan the Great is loosely based on Hulk Hogan.


The game's commentator can also heard on fellow Konami games, "Blades of Steel" and "Hard Puncher".


King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Collection Vol.0 - 276A-7708) on 21/07/1989.

Rip Cord (c) 02/1979 Exidy.


The goal of the game is to jump out of the plane and land safely on one of the many targets down below. The challenge is to avoid the numerous enemy helicopters that occupy the sky in between your plane and the ground.


You control the timing of your jump with the Jump button, at which point your parachutist begins hurtling toward the ground out of control. Pressing the D-Ring button shortly afterwards releases the chute and slows your descent. More importantly, it allows you at this point to control your left/right position via the paddle control to help you avoid the enemies.

Rip Off (c) 1980 Cinematronics.


RIP OFF is a 1- or 2-player action game that offers features guaranteed to capture and prolong player interest : an accelerating competitive level with a clearly visible object and a team competition option that allows players to combine scores as well as skills in defense strategy against a futuristic enemy.


The center of the playfield is occupied by a selectable number of triangular fuel cells that pulsate with radioactive energy. The player commandeers a land craft that turns left, right, accelerates and fires torpedo energy bursts activated by push-buttons mounted on the "bridge" control panel. All is quiet as the background audio repeats an ominous low frequency tone. Suddenly, alien craft enter in waves from the edges of the playfield attempting to attach their vehicles to the fuel cells and drag them off to restock their own dwindling supplies. The player maneuvers his land ship into position and fires a volley of torpedoes at the first invader, causing his vehicle to explode in a thunderous roar and a flash of light. A second invader retaliates by firing short range laser bursts at the defender ship while a third invader escapes, dragging off a precious fuel cell. The background audio quickens its pitch and tempo as another wave of sleeker, faster invaders attack and maneuver to rip off fuel canisters - and the battle rages on!


GAME PLAY


The 1-player mode is activated when a coin is accepted and the player pushes the 1-player button. As play begins the first player's vehicle appears on the right side of the screen and moves slightly forward. The enemy vehicles then appear in pairs from various points on the edge of the screen and gravitate toward the player and the triangles. The enemies fire lasers while they move. The player scores points by either shooting the enemy or colliding with him before the enemy can shoot the player, collide with him or drag his triangle off the screen. When a player's vehicle is exploded, it reappears on the right side of the screen where it began.


When a player has sufficient points to achieve a bonus level, the enemies will appear three at a time instead of in pairs and their point value increases. Each bonus level increases the enemies' point value, as well as their ability to seek out and destroy the player. When all the triangles have been dragged off the screen, the game is over and the unit reverts to attract mode.


The 2-player mode is activated when two coins have been accepted and a player pushes the two player button. As play begins, the first player's vehicle appears on the right side of the screen and the second player's vehicle appears on the left. Both vehicles move forward slightly. Enemy vehicles then appear in groups of three and attack the players and seek to drag off the triangles. Players score points by colliding with the enemy vehicles or shooting them. No points are scored by shooting or colliding with the other player. Should the players' ships collide, an explosion will occur and the players' vehicles will reappear at the points where they began.


In the 2-player operator selectable opponent mode, individual scores are displayed after each wave of attackers are destroyed or successfully leave the screen. In the team mode, the combined score of both defenders is displayed. At the end of the game, when all fuel canisters have been removed, the individual high score for the day is displayed at the bottom of the screen and the high team score is displayed at the top.


A player achieves bonus levels in which the value of each invader vehicle is increased by the displayed amount of the bonus. There are six different types of invader vehicles, each wave becoming increasingly offensive and more difficult to destroy. The point bonus is in effect after six waves, the full compliment of ship types, have been destroyed. There are three similar craft in a wave, and in the two player mode twelve waves must be eliminated before bonus goes into effect.


There are no time units per game credit, and the battle goes on until all fuel canisters have been "ripped off" from the playfield. The length of play is solely dependent upon the skill of the player - but it takes an experienced, practiced captain to hold off the swift invaders for long!

Released in March 1987.


Also released as "Road Blasters [Sit-Down model]".


For a limited period after the game's release, players could win a free Atari T-shirt by completing all 50 levels. 


Road Blasters was the last of the Atari System 1 games made. The original name of Road Blasters during its design was 'Future Vette'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Shoot cars using a single shot instead of holding down the fire button to increase the bonus multiplier.


* Crash into roadside cannons instead of shooting them for 8000+ points. This will greatly increase reserve fuel, which is awarded at the end of a rally based on score.


* If you crash your car into one of the turrets at the side of the road, you'll get 8-10x the current value of a turret. When your score multiplier is up to 10, this is 16-20,000 points! Early on, keep your score multiplier high and always crash into at least two of these babies every board and finishing the game (or doing very well at it) is not tough. After a while it gets hard to crash into two turrets every board and still finish the board on time.


* Tip For Strategies On Level 49 and 50 : Since level 50 is the last level, and the game gives you a complete recharge at the end of 49, accuracy doesn't count any more. Just keep firing as fast as possible.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Do Not miss the bonus car : As you proceed in the game, the difficulty level increases. You will make more misses and will lose fuel quickly. If you spot a bonus car, make sure to run into it, even if it requires you to slow down in the process.


* Get used to counter-steering : Driving without bumping into the enemy is extremely difficult. If you do bump into them, learn to stay calm and counter-steer!


* Secret bonuses : They are all hard to obtain, but they are worth the try! Keep on driving for a certain amount of time without bumping into the enemy -- Konamiman, a train, or an airplane will appear and give you bonus points.


* Run into bonus cars without missing any -- more bonus points.


* Make it to the goal without bumping into any enemy -- 10,000 bonus points.

Road Runner (c) 1985 Atari Games.


The player takes on the role of the Road Runner - from the much-loved Warner Bros. cartoon series - and must outrun and outsmart the villainous Wile E. Coyote, in this abstract sidways-scrolling racing game from Atari. A variety of traps and pitfalls await the Road runner (such as a cannon, land mines, cliff-top drop etc.) which must be carefully avoided. It is possible, however, to lure Wile E. Coyote into these traps to put some valuable distance between the Road Runner and his pursuer. Road Runner must also eat the piles of seed that appear at various points throughout the stages, as missing five bird seeds will cause Road Runner to faint and result in the player losing a life.


Road Runner's colourful, beautifully-drawn graphics capture the spirit and humour of the legendary cartoons perfectly. The music and sound effects are also faithful to the cartoon series.

- TRIVIA -


Road Runner, as with all the Atari System 1 games, was arguably one of the most distracting games in the arcade. If not setup properly, the Road Runner game would play all the background music during the intro cut scenes. The Arari System 1 speaker system had a great acoustic arrangement. Players would be immersed in a sea of sound allowing them to really get into the game play. Unfortuantely for others, they could hear the same thing on the other side of the room!


Not very many Road Runner units were produced from the factory. Most arcade owners purchased the conversion kit which was marketed and readily available from Atari at a lower price than a new system.  An Atari System 1 cabinet could be converted into a different game (only other Atari System 1 games) in a day.


A graphically enhanced version of this game (Apparently running on "Beat Head" hardware) was planned, where each stage would have a Road Runner cartoon scene as an intermission, spooled from a laserdisc. However, although a master was produced (now in the hands of a private collector of Atari prototypes), no discs were ever pressed and it is likely that no ROMs were ever burned.


Two Road Runner machines were shown at the 2003 classic arcade games show 'California Extreme' in San Jose, California.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Don't use an 8-way controller like Hot-Rod or X-Arcade with this game. You won't be able to control the Road Runner very well. Use a variable speed, jet-fighting type game joystick. This will allow you to control the variety of Road Runner speeds with precision. It makes the game much more fun and you'll get farther. 


Don't go so fast that you lose Wile E. Coyote from view. He'll coming whizzing back with a vengeance. He'll attack at high speed on rocket skates and in later levels, super sneakers.


If you stay close to Wile E. Coyote and maintain a constant speed (his arms will stick out in an effort to grab you), you can get a "Tongue Bonus" for 2000 points. The Road Runner will turn it's head around at Wile E. and stick out it's tongue twice, making that classic cartoon "Twoop twoop" sound.  Pretty funny to see.


In higher levels, invisible paint buckets will appear. You need to get to them and paint yourself before Wile E. Coyote does. If you manage to paint yourself with the invisible paint, Wile E. Coyote will lose sight of you, stand and look around with a "?" above his head.  Also funny to see.


On the levels where Wile E. coyote has acquired a portable helicopter and is dropping dynamite onto the Road Runner from above, keep running forwards while constantly moving the Road Runner diagonally up and down (on some levels, you need to be watchful for land mines); this makes it much more difficult for the Coyote to target you accurately.

RoboCop - The Future of Law Enforcement (c) 11/1988 Ocean Software.


A single player, side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up based on the 1987 movie of the same name. The game's story mirrors that of the film, with former cop Murphy, now a half-human cyborg called 'RoboCop', on a quest to bring down the evil OCP corporation.


RoboCop features nine levels of action, with two of the game's nine stages being into-the-screen target ranges, in which players can try to accrue bonus points and earn extra health. Wooden crates occasionally bar RoboCop's progress, but these can be punched to remove them. Marked crates can be smashed to reveal one of three Weapon power-ups; Three-way Gun, Dual Laser and the incredibly powerful Cobra Gun.


The film's incidental music plays throughout the game and RoboCop's speech is sampled directly from the original film.

After Ocean Software secured the RoboCop license, they sub-licensed it to Data East who created the coin-up game. Ocean then ported the game to various home computers.


Most of RoboCop's sounds were borrowed from "Heavy Barrel".


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (G.S.M. Data East 1 - D25B1002) on 21/06/1989.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


The following cheat for RoboCop can earn (theoretically) infinite scores : There exists a level in the game (the Junkyard), where there is an elevator. It's just after you get the Cobra gun. Anyway, you get on the elevator and ride to the top. When the elevator reaches the top, DON'T MOVE! Your score will suddenly start to increase, and will continue to do so until you step off the elevator.


Bad guys come onto the screen when you pass a certain pixel. Move back and kill them off; don't charge through the game. Learn the enemy movement patterns as they are the same in every play.


Here are some strategies for each level: 


* LEVEL ONE : The motorbike which damages you before you draw your gun can be beaten by jumping just before it comes on the screen. A shop window has a small menu type poster in it; jump around about there. When you land, punch the bike (it flashes green and doesn't damage you). Punch it when it returns to kill it.


When fighting the ED209, time your jumps until just AFTER it has fired at you, allowing you to jump over its shots. When it moves to the left third of the screen, stand close to it. RoboCop's weapons arm will now point at a steeper angle (more into the ground). Now move away slightly and jump away when ED209 fires. Its shots will go into the ground and not trap you at the left edge of the screen.


Another approach allows you to defeat the ED-209 almost instantaneously: First, make sure you still have the Three-Way Gun (not essential but makes things a little quicker and easier), then as soon as you clear the area of enemies the music will change and the ED-209 will growl. Simply walk to the right side of the screen (Before ED-209 enters) and fire repeatedly diagonally up and right. If done correctly, the ED-209 will come out already defeated and run away without so much as scratching you.


* LEVEL TWO ; To get extra health, shoot the fat guy using a girl as a shield. He moves forward to shoot at you - shoot him then.


Target practice : Getting all of the targets (100% hit) gives *extra* capacity for your energy bar.


Bug : Missing one target sometimes still gives 100% (but don't rely on it.).


* LEVEL THREE : Go over the top of the car crushers, and pick up the baby food. Try and save the Cobra assault cannon for the end of the level - this makes thing much easier. If you shoot just under the cab of the final enemy, you can kill the guy throwing grenades at you.


Alternate way : Get the cobra cannon, clean all the enemies at the elevator, the raise the elevator until the cobra cannon is slightly higher than ground level (about 1/4 inch or less), fire ONCE to the right and watch your score soar. Don't move or your score will stop. Also, this only works on the bootleg board - the original did not do this, probably due to a bug (At the far right, just outside of the screen, are some boxes and the machine thinks you hit them but doesn't destroy them).


* LEVEL FOUR : Shoot the metal crushers with the Cobra Cannon, or PUNCH repeatedly if you get trapped. The final enemy is a crane which swings a steel ball suspended from an extensible chain. Don't shoot the wooden box, stand on it and shoot the cab of the crane. Also, try to save the Cobra Cannon (by punching bad guys instead of shooting them) and use it on the crane.


* LEVEL FIVE : Don't charge through this level, especially on the conveyor belt. Be wary of the first guy armed with a flame thrower; if you're quick enough, you can shoot him before he gets a chance to shoot at you.


The military ED209 at the end of the level can be beaten by crouching under the OCP logo when it charges. Jump and shoot the weapon arm when it retreats.


* LEVEL SIX : You need to move through this level fairly quickly as time is a little tight. The ground-based moving gun turrets can be shot from the platform below, and careful diagonal shooting can destroy laser emplacements situated on any platforms above you. Concentrate on laser turrets which are diagonally away from you, as their fire is the hardest to dodge.


The last baby food on the level replenishes all of RoboCop's energy. Try and keep the laser shots until the end of the level. When you reach the top platform, move as far to the right as possible and shoot the military ED209 as much as possible before it activates. There is a comparatively safe position just at the end of the military ED209's forward walk (like the end of level five, but with no OCP marker). Kill the military ED209 first. Tactics for the other ED209 are similar to those of level 1.


* LEVEL SEVEN : Use diagonal shooting to destroy laser turrets on the platform above you (see also Level Six comment).


The baby food stored in the box gives all your energy back. When you reach the single lift which goes up multiple floors, the best way to avoid being trapped on it by laser fire is to JUMP onto the next level just before the lift reaches it. Timing between the laser shots is critical.


When this lift reaches the top, stop just short of the floor (you should be able to see/hear the light curtains and laser turrets) and then go back down as far as you can. The laser turrets and curtains sometimes disappear.


The final ED209 can be destroyed by standing at the far left of the screen and jumping up and down. Missiles launched at you can be destroyed by shooting or punching. When the ED209 gets too close, use the tactic of level one.


When ED209 is destroyed, kill Dick Jones (in the same way as a gunman holding a hostage is killed). The president is not harmed by your gun shots and must be punched from close range.

Robot Bowl (c) 01/1977 Exidy.


You have a top down view of a bowling alley with score cards shown on each side. The only thing in the game that uses an actual animation is the bowler himself, the robot has a several frame animation when he walks. Everything is (of course) shown in glorious monochrome black and white. The game begins with your robot bowler running up to the alley (his feet move faster than he does, which makes it look like he is running on a conveyor belt or something). You then have three seconds to roll the ball, before it will roll of its own accord. The game is controlled with five buttons, they are left, right, shoot, hook left, and hook right. When Exidy was making this game, they had to make a decision about how the hooking worked, and it seems that they decided that "Robots are telepaths, and can effect the balls movement after it is thrown!". You see you can't even hook the ball until after it is thrown. This makes it very easy to pick up the spare. The game makes up for that little trick by making 'splits' very common (the 7-10 split and the 4-7-10 split come up all the time). These are pretty annoying, but you can usually learn how to clear them out (except the 7-10 split, I still haven't figured out how to clear that one).


- TECHNICAL -


Robot Bowl was available in two different dedicated cabinets, an upright and a cocktail, both of them used the same internal hardware.

* The Robot Bowl upright was of the common 1970s 'short cabinet' design, as the machine had no marquee and was only as tall as the monitor. The cabinet itself was covered in dark woodgrain laminate (very popular back then), and all decorative touchs were on the large monitor bezel, which depicted a cartoon scene of a gray robot bowling. The robot looks a lot like the Tin Woodsman from 'The Wizard of Oz', except for the top of his head, and the fact that he is plugged in with an extension cord. He is labeled 'XXIDY MFG.' on his back. Some machines also had a decorative 'ball return' on the front at the very bottom of the cabinet.

* The Robot Bowl cocktail was a square box with a perfectly round top, the player controls were on either side of the monitor (and you actually had to look at the game sideways to play). This machine had no decoration of any kind.

At the time the game was created, Exidy had just purchased Fun Games and had a number of cabinets left over from one of Fun's driving games. They used these cabinets to get Robot Bowl into production quickly. The only problem was that the cabinets had a hole in the front where the gas pedal had been. Michael Cooper-Hart suggested that they silk-screen the words 'Ball Return' over the hole.

Robotron - 2084 (c) 1982 Williams.


JUNE 5, 2084

WILLELECTRINC

D382+

CLASSIFICATION : TOP SECRET

MISSION : OPERATION ROBOTRON


BACKGROUND : IT HAS ALL COME DOWN TO THIS. THE LAST CHANCE FOR CIVILIZATION AS WE KNOW IT. THE LAST GASP OF HUMANITY.

WE HAVE GONE TOO FAR. THERE IS NO WAY BACK.

OUR TECHNOLOGICAL SOPHISTICATION AND QUEST FOR A BETTER WORLD HAVE LED US TO PERFECT THE ULTIMATE ROBOT. A SPECIES OF ROBOT THAT CAN THINK AND ACT FOR ITSELF.  A SPECIES THAT NO LONGER NEEDS ITS CREATOR.


CURRENT STATUS : THE ROBOTS HAVE ORGANIZED AND REVOLTED.  THEY HAVE TURNED AGAINST THEIR MASTERS, THEIR MAKERS, AND THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE IS THREATENED.  THEIR MISSION IS SIMPLE:  TO RE-PROGRAM THE REMAINING FEW HUNDRED HUMANS INTO THEIR OWN IMAGE OR, FAILING THIS, TO WIPE ANY TRACE OF HUMANITY FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

YOU ALONE, THROUGH A MALFUNCTION IN GENETIC ENGINEERING, CANNOT BE RE-PROGRAMMED INTO ONE OF THEM. YOU ALONE HAVE THE UNIQUE POWERS OF THE OPTIC SHIELD TO PREVENT THE FINAL DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND.


MISSION : IT HAS ALL COME DOWN TO THIS. TO THE ULTIMATE CONFLICT BETWEEN MAN AND MACHINE. YOU ARE THE ONLY HOPE FOR SALVATION. THE ONLY HOPE FOR RESCUING THE HUMANS FROM THE CLUTCHES OF THESE MECHANICAL MONSTERS. DESTINY IS IN YOUR HANDS.


TECHNICAL DATA FOLLOWS : We wish we could do more to aid you in your rescue mission. We have retrieved and compiled all photographs and data from our master information banks that may help you achieve success.


Your only weapon is an Anti-Robot Laser Gun. Used effectively, it will give you the power to destroy all the Robot species except the Hulk. The control on the left of the panel will give you maneuverability in 8 directions. To evade. To attack. To rescue. The right control will empower you to fire your Laser Gun in 8 directions.


Each Robot attack wave will end when you disintegrate all the Robots in the wave except, of course, the indestructible Hulk.


At the start of the attack, you will have 3 chances to wipe out the enemy. Every 25,000 points you earn will grant you another chance to complete your mission.


Commit this data to memory. It is the difference between annihilation and survival of the human race.


MAN WOMAN CHILD : These are the only 3 types of human clones left on Earth. Defenseless and easy prey to the Robots, they are totally dependent upon you for their survival and will wander aimlessly until you make contact with them. Touching them will place them under your protective powers and earn you the following points:  1,000 for rescuing the 1st human; 2,000 for the 2nd: 3,000 for the 3rd; 4,000 for the 4th; 5,000 for the 5th; and 5,000 for every additional human saved. At the beginning of each new wave and when you lose a turn, rescue scoring will again begin at 1,000.


TANK : Its goal is to kill you by firing rebounding Shells. Annihilate the Tank for 300 points; the Shell for 50 points.


BRAIN : Red alert! The Brain is the most clever and dangerous of the Robot species. Its 2-pronged attack will be launched every 5th wave. If it collides with you, it will electrocute you where you stand. It also possesses the devastating power to tire Cruise Missiles which will mercilessly seek you out. Destroy or be destroyed. Kill the Brain for 500 points; demolish the Cruise Missile for 75 points.


The victims of the 2nd prong of the Brain's attack are the defenseless humans. If captured, a human will be irreversibly transformed, literally re-programmed by the Brain's incredible mind powers, into a Prog. Into a Robot that will viciously turn against its own protector, against you! Annihilate the Progs for 100 points or meet a violent death at their hands.


SPHEROID : This pulsating sphere may at first look harmless, but it is the mothership which spawns deadly Enforcer Embryos. You must try to explode the Spheroid before it ejects the Embryos to earn 1,000 points.


ENFORCER : The Embryos grow into evil Enforcers. Kill them for 200 points. Let them live and they will lessen your chance for survival by launching Enforcer Sparks. Destroy the Sparks for 25 points.


HULK : In all attack waves except every 5th, the Hulk will stalk his prey. He alone of the Robot species cannot be killed. Your Laser Gun can only slow him down or divert him from his objective of crushing all life from the humans and from yourself. You must avoid this Robot at all costs or your mission will be lost at the outset.


GRUNT : The least sophisticated species of Robot is the Grunt. He has no weapon and possesses only minimal intelligence. This does not mean he is to be dealt with lightly. He will single-mindedly pursue you to capture and destroy you. Kill him and score 100 points.


ELECTRODES The pulsating, immobile Electrodes will attempt to block your path. Collide with them and meet instant death. Fortunately, the Grunts will also be annihilated by this means. You must avoid the Electrodes or obliterate them with your Laser Gun. In each new attack wave they will assume a different shape, but remain just as deadly if contact is made.


- TECHNICAL -


Robotron was available in both upright and cocktail format, with the cocktail cabinet being fairly rare. The alternate cabinets also had different graphics (at least the color scheme was different), and are much more difficult to find replacement graphics for. The standard Robotron upright was 6'2'' tall and featured white sides and a black front. It had painted side-art in the form of a '2084' logo and a few stripes (this is a very simple design, and is easy to repaint if your cabinet happens to be scratched up). The control panel is covered with a geometric shape design, and has two 8-Way joysticks and two start buttons. These joysticks are of a peculiar design, but can easily be replaced with a pair of modern joysticks (purchase red ball tops ones, because that is what the originals had). The games marquee has the 'Robotron' logo in a font reminiscent of an early 80s computer. This is superimposed over a triangular design made from shapes and lines. The Robotron cocktail cabinet was finished completely with woodgrain laminate. The only graphics were on the control panels, and the small instruction cards that were placed under the top glass. The players would sit across from each other, and the screen image would flip for each player.

- TRIVIA -


Released in March 1982. Total production is estimated at 18,000 units. The upright cabinet style is common. Both the cabaret (or mini) and cocktail styles were produced in much lower numbers, one estimate citing only 500 cocktails produced.


The basic play of Robotron was programmed in 3 days. The design of Robotron was influenced by "Berzerk" and the Commodore PET game 'Chase'. The concept name was 'Robot Wars - 1984'.


The original name for the production was '2084 - Robotron', but the name Robotron was more commonly used by virtually everyone involved, and the game was renamed shortly before production. This is why the cabinet side artwork simply has the number 2084 vertically.


Robotron was unique at the time in that the controls were two 8-way joysticks (one for running, one for shooting) rather than the more typical single joystick and fire button. This unique dual-joystick control was created because of two occurrences : Jarvis liked the game "Berzerk", but hated the joystick-and-button run-and-shoot configuration; and the fact that Jarvis's right hand had been broken in a car accident shortly after he finished creating "Stargate".


This game shares some sounds from "Defender".


The human characters in this game are named Mommy, Daddy and Mikey. The idea and the inspiration for the character Mikey was from the 1970's commercial for 'Life' cereal.


Williams were sued by Walt Disney Productions for copyright and patent infringement regarding Williams use of 'Tron' in Robotron. Williams won the suit and Walt Disney releases Tron on time.


A Robotron machine appears in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance' and on the 1986 movie 'Better Off Dead'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your man will be in the middle of the playing field surrounded by various robots. Depending on the wave that you are on will determine exactly what robots are ready to terminate your existence. The game is straight-forward, take out all the robots (except HULKS) to advance to the next wave. It is vital for your survival that you learn how to 'scoot and shoot'. If you don't learn how operate the controls independently and run in one direction while shooting in other directions, you won't survive very long in this game.


* Equally important to 'scoot and shoot' is your ability to be able to fire on the diagonal. It's easy firing up, down, left, and right, but it takes a little more mastery to fire in the diagonal directions.


* Learn the different things the enemy robots do. For example, the SPEROIDS have a tendency to congregate in the corners. This works to your advantage since you can blast about 3 or 4 before they discharge their supply of ENFORCER robots.


* Your main objective is to blast a path through the robots and get to the edge of the screen. It doesn't matter what edge, just get to one. The reason is painfully simple : It give the robots one less direction to assault you from, plus, you can lead them around in circles blasting them and also cleaning out the corners from the above-mentioned ENFORCERS.


* Enforcer Bug : The enforcer bug is when an enforcer is in the lower right corner and you shoot it diagonal there is a 1 in 3000 chance the game will reset. The reason for the game resetting is there is a bug in the diagonal explosion code for enforcers. The memory below the screen holds the stack and an unclipped pixel can get 'drawn' into the stack causing the game to lock and the watchdog to kick in and reset the system.


* The only times where you won't want to seek the sides is during the BRAIN and TANK robot waves. The BRAINS fire a homing shot at your man so you need as much room to maneuver as possible so going against the wall would restrict that movement. The same goes for the TANK robots which fire bounce shots. They may miss you initially but you might get hit by the shot as it bounces up. You are safer in the middle area where you have room to maneuver. Just watch out for other enemies (which will be very low in number).


* Try to rescue the humans as long as it doesn't put your man in danger of dying. You can rack up some major points on the BRAIN waves since they are loaded with humans for the BRAIN robots to 're-program'. Again, make sure you have an avenue of escape. Doesn't make sense to save a human, get the extra man, then die. You, in essence, gained nothing from that level. You can also shoot the HULK robots to push them away from humans also. On the BRAIN waves, make sure you pick off the BRAIN robots as soon as possible. This prevents them from reprogramming the humans and leaves you more people to get major points with.


* The 'Mikey' bug - on the first Brain wave. There are a lot of Mommies and only one Mikey. The Brains all go for Mikey - if you can protect him (don't pick him up, though!), the Brains will ignore all other humans, making for a point-fest if you can grab them all. As soon as you die, however, the Brains will grab any human they find. This actually works on all Brain waves, but in the other waves the 'golden human' is a random Daddy or Mommy or Mikey, so you don't know who to protect. It's a bug, but a cool one.


* Since you don't have a limit on your shots, you can put up a 'wall' of energy in whatever direction you move. This can have a very devastating effect if applied right.


* Make sure you take a quick look at the wave to assess where the main threats are. You will have from 1 to 2 seconds to get ready for action. If you can survive the initial few seconds as you blast your way toward the edge, your chances of survival will be that much greater. Also be sure to remember what each wave has in store for you, this also will give you a greater chance of getting through the wave.


* If you get tired, you can take a break. That's right, wait for a TANK wave. Eliminate all of the robots except for one. After firing a few shots, the TANK robot will run out. After that, it's just a matter of avoiding the TANK and any other pesky robots.


* ENFORCERS, like their SPHEROID transports, tend to congregate in corners. Use this to your advantage.  Every now and then one or two will zip very fast across the field. Their main threat, though, is volume of fire. When you are on the edges, watch out since their shots tend to roll toward your man.


* See all those pretty shapes on the playing field? They are there as a nuisance. They will kill your man if he hits them. They can, however, be shot out of the way but yield no points.


* Robotron Name Trick : The formula consists of three sequences of buttons, that all must be completed within a quarter of a second of each other, without the player dying on-screen. The moves are as follows...

1) Fire Up while moving Right and press Player 1 button.

2) Fire Down while moving Up and press Player 2 button.

3) Move Down while firing Up.

The designer's names will appear and stay on the screen until the joystick is released from the Up position. Your game is over(!) once you've done this trick.

Roc'n Rope (c) 1983 Konami.


An incredibly difficult yet playable platform game featuring 4 different levels. The player takes on the role of a an archeologist whose mission it is to return the missing tail feathers to the golden Phoenix. The archeologist is armed with a harpoon gun and uses it to fire a rope into a platform above, in order to climb up the rope and progress up the level. This is vaguely similar to the superb 'telescopic arm' feature that appeared in Capcom's superb "Bionic Commandos".


All levels are patrolled by enemies in the form of dinosaurs and cavemen and all are deadly to the touch. Some cavemen will pull on the harpoon rope while the archeologist is climbing it. This will result in the player falling from the rope and losing a life. The archeologist is armed with a light ray that will kill the enemies.


A breakdown of the game's 4 levels :


* The 1st level is possibly the most difficult in the game. Players begin at the bottom left of the screen and must work their way up to the Roc, who is sitting at the upper right of the screen. There are many layers of ledges coming out from the sides of the screen. While the middle of the screen is open to the sky (except for a few floating platforms). To reach the top, players must use the harpoon gun to climb diagonally back and forth until they reach the top (ensuring that the Phoenix feathers have been collected on the way).


* The 2nd level is set underground. There are a lot of dinosaurs on this screen and far fewer platforms than on the first level. Many of the platforms stretch completely across the screen, so there aren't many pitfalls to be wary of. Once again, players must get the archeologist to the top of the screen to complete the level.


* The 3rd level is set outdoors. A 'ferris wheel' style rotating platform sits in the center of the screen, but this can be avoided if players don't wish to use it. The easiest route to the top is on the right-hand side of the level.


* The 4th and final level is shaped a little like a mountain. The player's main concern here is a large waterfall in the center of the screen. Players must time their harpoon climb just right to avoid being killed by the deadly waters. Once this level is finished, the game starts over with an increased level of difficulty.


- TECHNICAL -


Roc'n Rope was only available in an upright configuration. This upright was in a wood-grained cabinet that was similar in construction to the "Frogger" cabinet. The sideart was a large sticker showing an adventurer posing with a harpoon gun and a bird. The marquee shows this same adventurer firing his harpoon gun across a chasm at an unsuspecting dinosaur, while a cartoon caveman looks on suspiciously. The monitor bezel was unadorned, although most machines had a little instruction card underneath the glass. The control panel was a solid green and featured a single joystick mounted centrally, with two buttons to either side, which allowed for the game to be played with either hand.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Learn the angle at which you throw the rope : The rope is thrown at a very shallow angle. The rope ends up hown long distances. Learning this angle is the first step to mastering this game.


* Be careful of heights : If you fall a distance longer than the height of you character, that couns as a miss. Be careful when you fall.


* Use the rope to beat enemies : If you cut the rope when the enemy is hanging from it, you can beat the enemy. Attacking with the rope is extremely fun.


* Keep an eye on enemy movements : Right before the enemy moves up or down or hangs from the rope, the enemy always moves n a certain way. Learn the enemy's behavior and take action quickly.


* Make good use of the power food : Not only do you become invincible when you obtain the power food, but you also speed up! While taking out enemies is a good idea, you may want to consider traveling the level instead.

Rockman - The Power Battle (c) 1995 Capcom.


Have you ever pictured a Mega Man game that allows to skip all the platform elements and just grapple against the bosses? That's pretty much the main idea in this game! Choose from Megaman, Protoman or Bass and battle against classic bosses in the series. Features great 2-D graphics, solid control, and a nice use of strategy (since the right order of weapons will rid you of specific enemies in no time!).

Rod-Land (c) 04/1990 Jaleco.


An incredibly cute one or two player platform game in which two fairies must use their 'Rods of Sheesanomo' - two magical rods that enable the fairies to catch enemies and slam them into the platforms to kill them - to clear each level and continue their journey to the castle, to rescue their kidnapped mother.


As well as the magical rods, the fairies can also create a magical ladder - in a fashion very similar to that used in Taito's "Rainbow islands" - which can be utilised anywhere on a level that players wish, allowing them to reach other platforms or escape from any pursuing enemies.

Rolling Crash [Upright model] (c) 1979 Nichibutsu.


Rolling Crash is a 2-D maze racing game with changes to add to the variety of play. You control your car through the maze to pick up the dots while at the same time avoiding the car, or cars, that are constantly trying to ram you. Successfully get through one maze and many more await you. This is good practice for freeway driving in the big city.

- TRIVIA -


Released in October 1979.


Also released as "Rolling Crash [Cocktail Table model]".


Rolling Crash varies from the "Head-On" games in three ways :

1 : the game wraps around in a figure eight, making game play different in each part

2 : if you run into the enemy car where you can change lanes, your car doesn't die but instead gets pushed over to another lane.

3 : the dots actively slow down your car. This you can see as explosions.


- SCORING -


Dots : 3 pts X number of cars on field.

Highlighted areas : 200 pts X number of cars on field.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Always be aware of where the Jam Car(s) is/are located. They can only make one lane change at a time but that lane change may be into your lane.


* The faster you go, the fewer lanes you can cross. At full acceleration, you will only be able to change one lane at a time. In the earlier levels, this will be fine since you will only be dealing with one car. In the multiple Jam Car levels, this can be a very bad thing. Decelerate (take your finger off the accelerate button) to go across multiple lanes.


* The Jam Car(s) always travel in a clockwise motion while you travel in a counterclockwise motion. Remember that so that you don't get confused when there are multiple cars in the maze.  Also, the color of the Jam Car is red while yours is white.


* Don't try to get all the dots on one of the lanes. You need to anticipate where your next move is well before you enter the lane change area since you cannot change lanes at any other time.  Sometimes, on the earlier levels, it is best to do a staggered type dot pickup where you do lane one, change to lane two, to lane three, lane four, lane five, then back to lane one. If you time it right, the Jam Car or Cars will still be in the maze.


* Don't let the speed of the Jam Car(s) throw you. Just plan to be out of your lane before they enter into your lane. If they make it into your lane before you get to the lane change area, you will crash.

Rolling Thunder (c) 1986 Namco.


A single player takes on the role of a James Bond-esque secret agent codenamed 'Albatross'; who is a member of the "Rolling Thunder" agency. His mission is to stop a criminal organization known as Geldra, as well as rescuing a captured agent, Lelia Blitz, and overthrowing Geldra's leader, Maboo.


Rolling Thunder is a horizontally-scrolling platform shoot-em-up that is very similar in style - and was an obvious influence on - Sega's legendary "Shinobi", released a year later. Like Shinobi, the action takes place on two levels of platforms; with the player jumping and dropping as and when required. Each level is littered with doors; most of these contain constantly emerging enemies and must be carefully passed; some doors, however, also provide ammunition and new weapons; such rooms are clearly marked.

Licensed to Atari for US distribution.


A Rolling Thunder unit appears in the 1996 movie 'High School High'.


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Namco Game Music Vol.1 - 28XA-170) on 25/07/1987.


- UPDATES -


NEW VERSION :

* New title screen.

* BGM of area 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 10 are changed.

* Different enemy arrangement.

* Addition of a Continue feature.

* Addition of the Extra-life feature.

* 150 time units (180 in the old version).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* One of rolling thunder's more useful 'hidden features' is that it's actually possible to visit the ammo rooms more than once. Once you have stocked up on bullets from a particular room (for example, a Machine-Gun-Bullets room), go forward past the door approximately the distance of two jumps (ensuring that the door in question is completely off screen), then turn back, visit the room again, and find more ammo. The reason this works is because the game is divided into invisible 'sections' and once you cross a section boundary, the game forgets everything from the previous section.


* A step-by-step guide to one of Rolling Thunder's more impressive glitches :

1) In levels five and ten, once you get to a certain point in the level (around halfway through), you come up against two boxes stacked on top of each other (i.e. you can't jump over it), and a platform above you (on which you jump and continue to the RIGHT).

2) At this point, jump UP onto the platform, then position yourself at the very RIGHT EDGE of the railing on the platform (you can only jump up/down where railing is present) which should correspond to the very LEFT EDGE of the BOXES; then jump DOWN. This will put you at the very LEFT EDGE of the boxes.

3) Next, making sure not to move the joystick to the left, walk towards the RIGHT, hit the JUMP button, and you should find yourself 'caught' between the bottom and top boxes. Then jump RIGHT again, clearing the top box and landing on the ground. Don't fire at anyone, and don't panic, but simply go to the RIGHT watch yourself walk through everybody completely unharmed. You can simply walk past everyone until you reach the final, cloak-wearing enemy. Finally, providing you have properly stocked up on 'MG bullets' earlier in the game, simply hold down the fire button and kill the enemy. One final thing to note is that when using this method on level TEN, in that last area before the final arena, there are the 'stairs-like' hurdles, and on each of these steps, a white enemy will appear.

4) You have to be careful not to be in too much of a hurry, or they will follow you into the arena, where they can and will hurt you, or keep you busy enough that the guy in the cloak will. So make sure you have a little extra time to let those guys disappear off the screen (after you've made all of them appear) before going after the guy in the cloak in the arena.


* This is completely useless, but fun to do : at the end of each level there is this force field, which drags you through the door. Just before you get sucked in, turn your back to the exit and make low jumps (jump button only) while pushing the joystick towards the exit. This results in your agent jumping backwards a little every time. When the force field catches you, your character will appear to 'moonwalk' into the exit.

Rolling Thunder 2 (c) 1990 Namco.


A straight sequel to the suberb 1986 original, Rolling Thunder 2 sees one or two players taking control of secret agents in this scrolling, platform shoot-em-up. The agents once again find themselves up against the sinister GERDRA organisation and its many armed agents. Gameplay is very similar to the original, with doors both releasing enemies and hiding weapons and ammunition for the players to collect.


Rolling Thunder 2 improves on its illustrious predessessor in a number of ways; the most obvious one being the vastly improved and incredibly colourful graphics. The most striking improvement, however, is the addition of a simultanious, co-operative two player mode; which adds immesurably to the game's appeal. For the sequel, the one player agent is a woman, with a second player taking the role of a male agent.

Round-Up [Upright model] (c) 1981 Centuri.


The object of the game is for the player to maneuver his white robot in 1 of 4 directions within a maze, capture a red character robot as they move about the maze, and race to the center to change the 9 white balls located there to red. The player may only change one white ball to red at a time after he has captured a red robot, and must evade 4 chaser monsters in the process. Bonus point may be earned when capturing the elusive 'red king' that appears on the screen. Capture him and momentarily immobilize the chasers, but do not come in contact with the yellow robots--or your much-needed red robots will be changed to white and force you to change strategy. Play is over when the chasers have captured all of the player's robots. But, should the player be successful in changing all of the balls in the center to red, the pattern clears and a different challenge is presented. A 3x3 or 4x4 tri-colored pattern will appear at the bottom of the screen and a slightly different tri-colored cube of corresponding size will appear at the center of the screen. The player may earn bonus points by moving the directional arrow and rearranging the colors of the cube at the center of the screen to match the sample pattern presented at the bottom of the screen. The player is given 90 seconds to rearrange the cube as many times as he can. Action returns to the maze whether you win or lose the cube challenge. All in all, an exciting and challenging game where patience and skill are required.

Route 16 (c) 1981 Centuri, Inc.


Route 16 is a challenging race car game, integrating special features to excite the beginner as well as the seasoned player. The vivid video screen is fascinating, and is complimented by exceptional audio during game play.


The red car is controlled by the joystick feature, and is pursued through 16 different routes (mazes) by three chase cars. The search mode reveals an overview of all 16 routes, and the search mode appears whenever the car exits a route. In the search mode, the player car becomes a red cube, and the chase cars become yellow cubes.


Whenever the player car exits one route, there is a one second delay for a total overview of the game.


Each route has dead-ends, zig-zags, and multiple entrances and exits.


Some routes have the dollar symbol ($), and the player scores 200 points each time this symbol is cleared. The dollar symbols randomly chance to oil slicks, and when encountered, the oil slicks slow down the player car.


The question mark symbol (?) is surrounded by check points and will either reveal a bomb symbol or a bell mark after the player car clears the check point. The bell will add 800 points to the player's score when cleared. Player skill is tested here to avoid the bomb if it appears.


Some routes have a flag symbol, and when the player car clears the symbol, the pursuing cars become dollar symbols, and every effort should be made by the player to chase them down, and add extra points to his score.


One route has a flickering bonus car symbol. When the symbol appears, clear it and earn an additional player car.


One route has an additional game feature. When the player car enters the maze, it is pursued by an attacking monster. The player car cannot clear or collide with the monster, but must avoid it, or be destroyed.


The high-speed button is another feature of Route 16. When pushed, the player car is accelerated to escape the chase cars. Usage of the high-speed button reduces the player car's fuel. At the end of each round, bonus points are added to the player's score for remaining fuel.


After all the symbols are cleared, the round ends. In successive rounds, additional dollar symbols ($), and additional enemy chase cars are added.

A bootleg of this game is known as "Route X". Another bootleg was released by Leisure and Allied as "Route 16".


- SCORING -


Round moneybag : 200 points.

Larger moneybag : 800 points.

Enemy cars : 200, 400, 800 points etc.

End of level bonus : 10 points x remaining fuel.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Remember that the biggest score available in the game by far is for the remaining fuel at the end of a level, so use your turbo boost sparingly and not at all if possible.


* When in a room with a chequered flag, try to lure as many of the enemy cars in as possible before getting the flag. The enemy cars automatically flee when they turn into money, so you need them grouped.


* When aiming to collect the money surrounded by the four squares, note that the first square turns the money into a bomb, so collect a second square before grabbing the money.


* Since the 12 outer rooms only have one entrance/exit, try and sneak in there when the opposition is furthest away, so that you can get in and out before they close in on you.

- TRIVIA -


This game is known in Japan as "Argus no Senshi - Legendary Warrior".


- UPDATES -


The differences between the US (set 1) and US (set 2) are :

* 'Set 2' has a bug in the code which lets p2 start a game when p1 is already playing. You need to set a dip-switch to enable this behavior (it is usually on by default). If you press '2' while p1 is playing a single player game, 'Set 2' will check that you have 1 or more credit before it registers that you're now in a 2 player game, but it won't deduct the credit. That's a bad bug and probably accounts for why a bug-fix version was released.

* In 'Set 2', if p2 starts while p1 is already playing, it says 'playre2' instead of 'player2' at the top right.

* The first screen of 'Set 2' says 'ALL RIGHT RESERVED' - missing an 'S' - that's fixed in 'Set 1'


The differences between the US and Japanese (Argus no Senshi) are :

* The demo sequences are different.

* The Japanese version seems to have more hidden powers, stars and an extra free life.

* The US version is more biased towards stars and explosions.

21) Snake: 500 points

22) Swooping Bat : 250 points

 

* Artifacts :

Coin : 200 points bonus. The ones that shoot out of fire pits on some levels can be shot instead of collected but doing this gets you only 100 points.

Blue item : 500 points bonus.

Round blue item : 1000 points bonus.


* Temple bonuses :

1) Repulse Bonus : you get 200 points for each enemy destroyed. Up to a maximum of 12.800 points.

2) Rank Bonus : you get the points for whatever rank you're currently on.

3) Timer Bonus : you get 100 points for each remaining second.


* Rank bonus : it's based purely on the number of kills you've made in total per rank, regardless of dying. After you get promotion count the number of kills from zero again. As you can see the stripes start off pretty inconsistent but end up just being another stripe per 50 kills. If you kill an enemy with the Cross power's force field (i.e. you run into it, not shoot it) you get the points but nothing counts towards your rank. If you die and continue you keep your rank, but not your score. However, I have just found out that if you set the bonus lifes to any other values other than the default 50k/200k/500k the amount of baddies you need to kill is effectively doubled.


1) 1st rank :

Score awarded in temple : 0 points, plus 1000 points for each stripe. The minimum score for this rank is 1000 points.

Number of kills for stripe : II = 20 Kills, III = 50 Kills, IIII = 90 Kills (promotion to second rank on 130 kills. Count kills from 0 again)

 

2) 2nd rank :

Score awarded in temple : 5000 points, plus 1000 points for each stripe.

Number of kills for stripe : I = 40 Kills, II = 90 Kills, III = 140 Kills, IIII = 190 Kills (promotion to third rank on 240 kills)


3) 3rd rank : :

Score awarded in temple : 10.000 points, plus 1000 points for each stripe.

Number of kills for stripe : I = 50 Kills, II = 100 Kills, III = 150 Kills, IIII = 200 Kills (promotion to forth rank on 250 kills)

 

4) 4th rank :

Score awarded in temple : 15.000 points, plus 1000 points for each stripe.

Number of kills for stripe : I = 50 Kills, II = 100 Kills, III = 150 Kills, IIII= 200 Kills (promotion to fifth rank on 250 kills)


5) 5th rank :

Score awarded in temple : 20.000 points, plus 1000 points for each stripe.

Number of kills for stripe : I = 50 Kills, II = 100 Kills, III = 150 Kills, IIII = 200 Kills (promotion to sixth rank on 250 kills)


6) 6th rank :

Score awarded in temple : 25.000 points, plus 1000 points for each stripe.

Number of kills for stripe : I = 50 Kills, II = 100 Kills, III = 150 Kills, IIII = 200 Kills (promotion to 'BEST' rank on 250 kills)


7) BEST rank :

Score awarded in temple : 30.000 points

Once you get the 'BEST' rank, your rank is actually still increasing by 1 stripe/1000 points for every 50 kills. For some reason the programmers decided to continue the ranking system but not to include any more graphics. But, if you get it to 64,000 the next bonus goes back to 1000 points!!! On the high score table the rank badge loops around and displays the first rank onwards. I would have thought that they'd have changed the colour of the wings or something. It looks very strange to finish the game with 4.000.000 points and have the first rank!


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* 10,000 Points Bonus : At the end of each level, at THE VERY INSTANT the game takes control and guides you into the temple, pull diagonally Left-down on the joystick. Do it right and you'll get 10,000 points.

Note : The hundred number of your points must be the same as the units of your time, for example, 33,330 points and 13.30 seconds, or 100.000 points and 00.00 seconds.


* 2nd 10,000 Bonus : there's a 10k bonus available from the 4 creatures that stand on each others shoulders. You must kill all 4 of them before they touch the ground. There's several ways to do this but the easiest way is with the Crown and Sun powers. Simply stand at the bottom of the stack and shoot straight up! On round 17 these creatures are unlimited and form a new stack every few seconds. Staying back on that round after a time-out might even net you as much as an extra 100k if you can dodge Death for long enough! I have seen players use this trick to get over half a million on that round alone simply by staying back for long periods of time and using up their lives.


* 50,000 Bonus : this one is scored from any of the large blue demons that appear at the end of every 4th round and also there's two on the final round. You need the Tiger power for this, just jump on his head and kill him for an easy 50k! There's eight in the game so that's a luscious 400,000 points for the lot! Mmmmmm!


* 1st 70.000 Bonus : you can get 70.000 points for collecting the stars hidden in the stones. For each 7 you collect, you get 70k regardless of how many times you died.


* 2nd 70.000 Bonus : the Star Tree. In the middle of round 13 there is a tree where if you shoot at it in various places stars will appear. Every star you reveal counts as one collected. So in other words you can reveal all the stars and get 70k and then collect them to get a total of 140,000 points. Some of the stars are in bad positions so you'll have to bounce off a falling warrior to collect them or wait for Death and bounce off him. This part of the round is also where the parchment is (see below).


* 100.000 Bonus : if you finish the game you only receive a 100.000 points bonus. This is strange as it is only the third highest bonus in the game.


* 160.000 Bonus : this is received by collecting all 5 of the special powers. The bad thing is it can only be gained once per life.


* 1.000.000 Bonus : on round 13 there's a hidden parchment which is worth 1.000.000 points! It's located in-between the same area as the famous Star Tree and the next house. The place to shoot at is at the left side of the house just below the title Time. When you shoot nothing will happen except make a sound like you're hitting something. After about 12 hits (about 4 or 5 with the Crown and Sun powers) a red parchment will fall down which is worth 1.000.000 points when collected. Grab it quick because it vanishes after only a few seconds!

Safari (c) 1977 Gremlin.


This game was in black and white, not greyscale (like many early games used), but just 2 colors, black and white. But the characters and animals were large, and very detailed for just using a single color. There were 4 different animals that you could hunt. Snakes and lions were both rather slow moving, and good for 100 points each. Wild boars would run quickly across the screen, but would net you 200 for a kill. Finally, vultures were small and would move around erratically near the top of the screen (being worth 300 points if you could hit them). Touching any of the beasties meant instant death, but it mattered little, because this game played on time limits anyway. Death only meant that you would lose a few seconds waiting for your intrepid big game hunter to reappear (the game lasted 90 seconds total).

This June 1977 release was a joint venture between Sega and Gremlin. It came in a green dedicated cabinet with sideart of a hunter in a jungle scene. This may have been the first game to utilize twin joysticks. The first was a 4-Way joystick that controlled the movement of your hunter. While the second was a 2-Way joystick with a top mounted fire button. That one was used to aim and shoot. This game uses a cabinet overlay to produce the surrounding effect.

Saint Dragon (c) 03/1989 Jaleco.


The galaxy is under threat from a malevolent race of cyborgs. Half animal, half machine, the cyborgs have already conquered most of the galaxy and now have their sights set on the galaxy's last hope, 'The Planet of the Golden Dragon'. A lone mechanoid dragon, unhappy with the actions of his comrades, rebels and sets out to thwart their invasion of the Planet of the Golden Dragon.


Saint Dragon is a demanding and playable sideways scrolling shoot-em-up, played over six different stages. The tail of the mechanoid dragon the player controls is impervious to enemy attacks and causes damage to any enemy it touches. The head of the dragon is effectively the 'ship' of the game and a direct hit from an enemy will result in the loss of a life.


At various points in a stage bronze-coloured eggs appear which, when shot, release weapon and speed power-ups.

Salamander (c) 1986 Konami.


Salamander is a 1 or 2 player sequel to 1985's superb shoot-em-up, "Nemesis". While it retained the same basic gameplay and feel of its predecessor (particularly the superb and innovative weapons system), Salamander featured both superior graphics and a more imaginative approach to level design. The earliest example of the latter appears towards the end of the very first level, in which imposing, organic obstructions grow before the players' eyes. The game's third level - the infamous 'lava' level - is another good example of Salamander's superb design; with huge solar flares constantly erupting both above and below the player's ship that must be carefully navigated to avoid instant loss of life. Salamander introduced further variety to the action with the introduction vertically-scrolling levels, which alternated with the standard side-scrolling levels.


Salamander's weapon power-up system is as follows :

* SPEED UP : Five speed levels.

* MISSILE : Press missile button to launch.

* LASER : Your forward rockets turn into deadly lasers.

* RIPPLE LASER : Use shoot button to fire.

* FORCE FIELD : Protect your ship with barriers.

* MULTIPLE : Increase your fire power by up to four times.


Multiple special powers can be obtained, but the LASER cannot be used in conjunction with the RIPPLE Laser.

- TRIVIA -


Released in July 1986.


This game is known in US as "Lifeforce", but it was re-released one year later in Japan as "Lifeforce" (June 1987).


Salamander is the game that inspired Ikeda Tsunemoto (Toaplan>Cave) to develop the 'Danmaku'; the shot patterns seen in "Donpachi" et al.


Note : The kanji on the Japanese version title screen actually reads 'Sa Ra Man Da', meaning 'Sand Gauze Wide Snake'. This is an example of 'ateji', where Japanese artists use the phonetic value of a character to fit the game's name allowing them to write the name in kanji as opposed to a kana.


The first boss in Salamander appears as BRAIN GOLEM in "Kyukyoku Sentai Dadandarn".


Apollon Music released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Original Sound of Salamander - BY-5020) on 16/12/1986.

King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Salamander - Again : Konami Kukeiha Club - KICA-7601) on 25/05/1992.

Sony Music Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Salamander Arcade Soundtrack - KOLA-030) on 09/04/2003.


The story between the different versions of Salamander differs. While the story in the arcade original is not entirely clear, the NES version claims a large creature named Zelos (possibly the serpent often pictured on the game's cover art) is preparing to swallow your planet whole, and you must stop it from the inside out. The US arcade follows primarily the same story. the Japanese LifeForce may have a more surgery-related story, involving the removal of an unwanted virus or microbe from the body. The MSX version of Salamander differs the most from any of these. Basically, a prophecy from long ago comes true when an army attacks Latis and it's surrounding planets. They have created a barrier around Latis, and the only way to undo it is by activating a 'crush below' system created by ancient Latisians.


- UPDATES -


Salamander, the original Japanese release, was originally a spin-off of "Gradius", but with a simplified power-up system and overhead stages.


Lifeforce, the US release, is just like the Japanese original only with slightly different color palettes.


Lifeforce, the Japanese re-release, has more organic looking graphics and adopts the "Gradius" power-up system.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Bypass the mini-boss in stage 6 : In stage 6 (Zelos's fortress if you're playing Salamander or the brain area if you're playing Life Force), there is a mini-boss section consisting of multiple boss ships that fire sets of 4 lasers. Move your ship all the way to the top of the screen and you will be safe until this section ends. This glitch does not work in the Japanese re-release version of the game (the one with a purple background in attract mode).

- TRIVIA -


Released in July 1993.


The game is known in Japan as "Samurai Spirits (SNK)".


Samurai Shodown is the first game that introduced weapon fighting into the fighting game genre. The game used an upgraded version of the scaling graphics engine that was originally featured in "Art of Fighting".


Samurai Shodown also started SNK's reputation for their unique style of Engrish, known as SNKgrish in their games.


Unlike "Mortal Kombat", the usage of blood in this game is generally accepted, and the decision to replace blood with 'white blood' remains a sore point among fans of this series.


Samurai Shodown is considered by some to portray Japanese culture and language effectively. Unlike most American versions of Japanese video games, the characters in this game (including the announcer) generally speak fluent Japanese with subtitles, and traditional Japanese music is often heard during gameplay. Samurai Shodown takes most of its characters from either historical sources or characters from the Ninja Scroll anime. In fact, a few designers that worked on Samurai Shodown also worked on the Ninja Scroll anime...


Haohmaru is based on the legendary samurai Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645), whose fighting philosophy heavily influenced that of the Haohmaru character.


Ukyo Tachibana is Based on Sasaki Kojiro Genryu (1572-1612), Musashi's skilled rival.


Jubei Yagyu is based on the historical Yagyu Jubei Mitsuyoshi (1606-1644), who was a sword instructor to the Tokugawa shogunate. The Yagyu clan was a famous clan of samurai.


Hattori Hanzo Masashige (1541-1596) was the most famous of the Iga Ninja clan. He was a genius at leading night raids on forts and fiefs and became a feared assassin. Under his leadership, Iga Ninja became so notorious that Nobunaga felt it necessary to obliterate the Iga Ninja clan.


Wan-Fu seems to be a combination of two famous Chinese warriors. The first is a famous Chinese swordsman who was a rebel during the Ch'ing Dynasty. His name was Wang Ts-bin Wu, but he became known as Da Dao Wang Wu ('Big Scimitar Wang Wu'). The second lead bases Wan Fu upon the ancient, almost legendary, founder of the Chou Dynasty, King Wu Wang.


Kyoshiro Senryo is based on Nemuri Kyoshiro, a fictional character created by Shibata Tosaburo. 'Kyoshiro' translates to something like 'deranged fellow'. Tosaburo's Kyoshiro had nothing to do with kabuki theater as does Samurai Shodown Kyoshiro. Kyoshiro's weapon is called a naginata.


Charlotte is based on a character in the manga 'The Rose of Versailles' by Riyoko Ikeda (1972).


Gen-an Shiranui looks much like Mushizo, the hunchback demon of Ninja Scroll. Gen-an's weapon is modeled after the weapon wielded by Shijima, the shadow demon, from Ninja Scroll. Although they share a surname, Gen-an is not a relative of Mai Shiranui of the Fatal Fury/King of Fighters series.


Amakusa Shiro Tokisada (1622-1638) led a Christian uprising against the Tokugawa shogunate in the Shimabara region of Japan.


Nakoruru is a homage to Sailor Moon.


A 'Kuroko' is a traditional Kabuki theater stagehand. They are traditionally dressed in black and took care of scenery and other behind-the-scenes needs during a Kabuki performance, just like modern theater stagehands. In the case of Samurai Shodown, Kuroko is the referee for each match in Samurai Shodown I and II. The black strip of fabric hanging over a Kuroko's face is to signify that they are not part of the Kabuki performance, just helping with the props. The red and white flags that Kuroko has are used in traditional martial arts matches, where each successful hit gets the corresponding fighter's flag raised.


Mai Shiranui (of Fatal Fury) appears in Haohmaru's and Gen-An's endings.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Samurai Spirits - PCCB-00135) on 17/09/1993.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Alternate Costume Colors : Highlight a fighter at the character selection screen and press D.


* Sleeping Mamahaha : This is just hilarious! To see this while playing as Nakoruru simply stand still, after a 8 secs or so Mamahaha will land on Nakoruru's shoulder, start yawning and then it will fall asleep!


* Poppy's Puppies : To see a truly cool & funny secret pose with Galford, Get a PERFECT against an opponent while unarmed. You must finish the battle with anything except a throw though!


* Tam Tam's Broken Ending : If you use continues while beating the game with Tam Tam, you will miss a part of the whole ending (You can't see his real face). Beat the game with one credit in order to see his face.


* Wan-fu's Sword Explosion Bug : While playing as Wan-fu trap an enemy against the edge of the screen then perform the Explosive Sword Drop with the B button (HCB + B) to throw the sword and land next to the opponent. Since most players as well as the CPU are likely to block the move, crouch and hit them with the C button (a short kick). This will make the move unblockable and causes tons of damage!


* Cut-proof Characters? : Sometimes a finishing slash will cut most opponents in half, however some characters (these being Kyoshiro & Amakusa) cannot be cut in half!

- TRIVIA -


Released in October 1994.


This game is known in Japan as "Shin Samurai Spirits - Haohmaru Jigokuhen" (translates from Japanese as 'True Samurai Spirits - Haohmaru's Incident In Hell').


Kafuin Nicotine (Anglicized as 'Caffiene') is based somewhat on the Ninja Scroll character Dakuan who shares outfit and is armed with similar weapons. The 'papers' that Nicotine throws are called 'o-fuda', which are talismans inscribed with a prayer to endow them with certain powers. Japanese occultism and lore at work.


Neinhalt Sieger's name translates from German as 'non-stop victory'.


Genjuro Kibagami is a huge reference to a Japanese hanafuda deck. Hanafuda is a Japanese card game in which all cards represent a certain flower and time of the year. The hanafuda cards can be seen when Genjuro hits his opponent with special moves. Among the cards seen are wistaria, maple and peony. All cards shown are from an actual hanafuda deck.


Ryuhaku Todo (of AOF) appears in Gen-An's ending.


If you wait a long time, Hikyaku will throw food and/or bombs to the screen. Every so often, Kim Kaphwan (of Fatal Fury) will come out instead.


Kuroko's moves are largely borrowed from other characters.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Shin Samurai Spirits - PCCB-00164) on 02/11/1994.

This game is known in Japan as "Samurai Spirits - Zankurou Musouken" (literally 'Samurai Spirits - Zankuro's Matchless Sword') and in Korea as "Fighters Swords". The full US name for the game is "Samurai Shodown III - Blades of Blood".


Kafuin Gaira is a Buddhist monk whose weapons are giant 'mala', or Buddhist prayer beads. When Gaira wins the first round of a match, he throws a few punches and says 'Tenchu!', which means 'retribution!'. Gaira says a traditional Buddhist prayer for his fallen opponent when he wins the final round of the match. 'Namu amida butsu', Gaira's prayer, is basically 'go to heaven' or 'rest in peace'.


Shizumaru Hisame is a homage to Himura Kenshin (a character from the manga 'Rurouni Kenshin').


Zankuro Minazuki is a homage to Raijyuta Isurugi (another character from 'Rurouni Kenshin').

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Beat the entire game in the time limit to see a picture of Wan-Fu or Sieger after the end credits. Who appears is entirely at random though.


* In order to see a special win pose with the puppies, win with a double

perfect using Slash Galford. Galford will say, 'Arigato!' as the puppies

scamper across the screen.


* I'm Not Afraid Of You! : think you are really good? Tap START 3 times quickly to make your character drop his/her sword. Now show your opponents that the most fearsome weapons are the ones you were born with! Note : a few characters are really hampered by the loss of weapon (e.g. Haohmaru, Kazuki, Sogetsu) and a few are not really affected (Nakoruru, Rimururu, Hanzo).


* Sepukku (Suicide) : press Back, then move your joystick a quarter circle from forwards to down and press START to make your character kill himself/herself and lose the current round (Useless trick? Not quite since you will start the next round with a full rage gauge!).


* Silly Name Trick : now this is weird! At the naming screen input 'AAA' as your name to make your character faint!

This game is known in Japan as "Tenchi Wo Kurau II - Sekiheki no Tatakai" and outside Japan as "Warriors of Fate".


The background and all characters were based on an actual history : The Period of Three Kingdoms after the 'Han' Dynasty in China. Character designs were based on a popular Japanese manga called 'Destruction of Heaven and Earth' published by Shueisha in Japan and created by Moto Kikaku.

- TRIVIA -


Released in October 1985.


Considered by some to be the grandfather of all real-time video battle-games, Sarge was the first coin-op game to give players the ability to deploy multiple vehicles against common adversaries and, of course, each other.


Sarge is also probably the first real 'start-to-finish' design collaboration between artist/animator Brian Colin and programmer Jeff Nauman. 


From Brian Colin, Lead Artist on Sarge : "The realistically depicted female soldier featured in the game generated so much interest when it was first introduced that, part-way through it's production run, we slipped a hidden player incentive. With the machine's internal DIP switches set a certain way, players who achieved a rank of Colonel were greeted with a winking, sexy GI Jane wearing little more than a smile.

The DIP switches should be set as follows : 0011000100.

To see if the switches are set correctly, look at the girl at the start of the game. If she is wearing a low-cut T-shirt, then the 'hidden player incentive' is on.".

Satan's Hollow (c) 1981 Bally Midway.


SATAN'S HOLLOW is a 1- or a 2-player game. When playing this game, the Rocket Launcher is under YOUR control. YOU make it move back and forth across the screen to launch Rockets that will eliminate your attackers. These attackers are displayed in groups, called 'racks', across the top of the screen. The first rack is made up of a small number of attackers. The second rack is made up of a larger number of these attackers. And intermixed with the racks of attackers is a rack with only a single fire-breathing Devil's head.


The attackers and the Devil's Head will try to wipe out your Rocket Launcher. If they do, you lose one player. In emergencies, you have a Shield which goes all around your Rocket Launcher for a short period of time. It is activated by pushing the Shield button on the control console. BUT BE CAREFUL!! This consumes a lot of power and will only last a VERY SHORT TIME!


Each attacker eliminated will cause a Bridge Section to appear at the lower left corner of the screen EXCEPT : when there is already a Bridge Section there or when you have a Bridge Section in tow under your Rocket Launcher. Pick these Sections up with your Rocket Launcher and move them over to build a Bridge across the gorge at the right side of the screen leading into the land of SATAN.


When you complete your Bridge into the land of SATAN, you can cross it and do battle with him. If you win you will be rewarded by increased fire power for your Rocket Launcher. If SATAN defeats you, you lose one player.


As your skill level increases, the number of attackers is increased and the speed that the fire-breathing Devil's Head moves is increased also.


Bonus Rocket Launchers are awarded to you periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values. Each attacker has an assigned point value.


The object of the game is to HAVE FUN while constantly improving your skills as you play, eliminating as many attackers as possible each time to get the highest score.

This game had a dedicated cabinet that was just plain evil. It is red with realistic demons on both the sideart and the marquee. Flames and a blacklight on the control panel area add to the cool factor. In fact, this machine is up there with "Tron" in the ranking for coolest looking game around. The game was controlled by means of a 2-way trigger stick that was red and sort of translucent. This is the same basic stick that was used for "Tron", it is just colored differently. No one makes this exact stick anymore, but any trigger stick would make a fine replacement.


The cocktail version came in the standard Midway cocktail table (the same one as "Galaga" and "Pac-Man"). It used standard joysticks with separate fire buttons, which had to be used with your right hand rather than your left, because of where they put the button.

Designed and programmed by Arcade Engineering, who designed a slew of games for Midway before being bought out by them in 1985.


The game was released in 1982. The copyright date on the screen says 1981 but Jeff was still working on it when Brian was hired in the fall of 1982.


The game drew some criticism in the bible belt for its theme.


Some wiring harnesses are labeled 'Satan's Master' and others have 'Satan's Power' on the tag. These may have been pre-production titles for the game.


It seems like this game has copied its ideas from many other places. Check it out :

* Enemies going down and attacking your stock is similar to the ducks from "Carnival".

* The elaborate, mostly static background reminds of "Pleiads".

* The shield idea is used similarly to the shield in "Phoenix" (though you couldn't move when using it then, and it took longer to recharge).

* The diving enemy concept was used first in "Galaxian".

* The shot-increasing power-up concept originated in "Galaga".


A Satan's Hollow unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.

Saturday Night Slam Masters (c) 1993 Capcom.


A 1-on-1 fighting game in which players choose from 10 different wrestlers and take to the ring to try and defeat their larger-than-life opponents. Each wrestler has an assortment of moves, including his own special 'super slam'. The object of the game is to win and defend the championship by pinning or putting a submission hold on your opponent.


There are 2 different game modes to select and play : Single Match or Tag Team 'Battle Royal'. In Single Match, players choose to be one of eight wrestlers including 'Mike Hagger', 'Alexander The Grater', 'El Stingray', 'King Rasta Mon', 'Titanic Tim', 'Gunloc', 'Biff Bolshevik' and 'The Great Oni' ('Jumbo Jack' and 'The Scorpion' cannot be selected in this game).


Once a wrestler has been selected, players will compete in a world-wide tournament against the other 9 wrestlers (including 'Jumbo Jack' and 'The Scorpion') in respective matches. In each match, players must defeat each of their respective opponents by a pinfall, count-out or submission in order to proceed to each of the following matches. Once all opponents are defeated, the winner will be crowned champion and players will have to face all opponents again to defend their title.


In Tag Team 'Battle Royal', players can choose to play as any 2 of the 10 wrestlers for their tag team, including 'Jumbo Jack' and 'The Scorpion'. Here, the player and his or her partner have to eliminate both of the 2 wrestlers on the opposing tag team, in order to win the match and proceed to the next. During these matches, if the player is eliminated before his or her partner is, the match will be declared no contest and it will be a draw.


During each bout in this game, metal buckets and/or glass bottles will sometimes be thrown into the ring which can be picked by the players' wrestler(s) and used as weapons against their opponents.

Released in July 1993.


This game is known in Japan as "Muscle Bomber - The Body Explosion".


Hara Tetsuo, who designed the characters in the Muscle Bomber games, is a popular manga artist in Japan. He is famous for his work on 'Hokuto no Ken' (aka 'Fist of the North Star').


Some characters in the game are based on real life wrestlers. Such examples are the Great Oni, who is based on legendary Japanese wrestler the Great Muta, El Stingray, who is based on Mexican wrestler Lizmark, Alexander the Grater is based on former WCW and IWGP world champion Big Van Vader, and Jumbo Flapjack is based on the late Canadian wrestler Earthquake.


One of the wrestlers is Mike Haggar from the game "Final Fight". Also, one of the wrestlers named Gunloc is related to Guile from "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior". Additionally his clone, named Biff, is a friend of Zangief from "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior".


King Rasta Mon was the original design for "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" character Blanka, but rejected later on in favor of the most 'beast-like' design.


Biff Slamkovich appears in the background of Ken's stage in "Street Fighter Alpha 2". 


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Muscle Bomber - PCCB-00136) on 17/09/1993.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* If you manage to shoot all the first few screens worth of enemies (which is much easier with two players) you get rewarded with a group of dragonflies moving across the top. Each dragonfly is worth 10,000 points.


* Watch out for WOPs, which are POWs in reverse. They reduce your power level.


* There are special POWs that turn enemies into fruit. They're not the pretty POW on a circular background - those give power-ups - these are just the word POW. If you find one of these, hold off on using it until you get several of the bigger enemies onscreen. They're worth 5,000 points in their fruit form.

Released in April 1995.


This game is known in Japan as "Fu'un Mokushiroku - Kakutou Sousei" (translates from Japanese as 'Wind and Cloud Apocalypse - Hand-to-Hand Fighting Genesis'). 'Mokushiroku' is Japanese for the Christian book of Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse. 'Sousei' is Japanese for 'creation of the world', or 'genesis'. 'Sousei' and 'Mokushiroku' are diametrically opposed, just like 'Genesis' and 'Apocalypse' - and used here as a metaphor for the conflict between Syo Hayate and Shishi-Oh (King Lion).


'Fu'un' in the Savage Reign series actually refers to the fighting style of the main character, Syo Hayate.

Scramble (c) 1981 Konami.


In Scramble, a single player takes control of a spaceship and has to fight their way through 6 different levels. Contact with either scenery of objects results in an instant loss of life. The player's Scramble ship is armed with both a blaster and bombs; the blaster is used for enemy ships, while the bombs fall down to attack ground-based targets and to collect fuel from fuel dumps. The fuel dumps are of particular importance as the player ship's fuel gauge constantly decreases as the player progresses, and the only way to fill it back up is by bombing the fuel tanks that are located throughout the levels.


Fuel usage increases as the game progresses, until fuel usage actually outstrips the amount of fuel dumps available and the game becomes impossible.


Scramble is considered a classic and was the world's first ever 'multi-level' shoot-em-up.


- TECHNICAL -


The Scramble cabinet was the same basic cabinet design that Stern used for all its games. It featured a monitor that was set back at a 45 degree angle, and a very large marquee that was angled towards the player. Most cabinets have straight up and down marquees, so Stern ones are easy to spot. This title features rather primitive painted sideart that only uses two colours, but it makes up for it with the impressive comic-book style art on the control panel and monitor bezel.


The marquee has a roundish 'Scramble' logo, with some sort of space castle in the background. The control panel is aluminum, and it has a mostly yellow design, with game instructions and a red ball-top 8-Way leaf switch joystick mounted centrally. It has fire buttons on both sides of the panel, so it can be played either left handed or right handed. The industry later forgot about lefties altogether and went completely right handed. Most of these machines were uprights, but there were several cocktail units made as well.

Released in February 1981.


Licensed to Stern for US manufacture and distribution (May 1981).


Sometimes unfairly referred to as a 'poor man's Defender', Scramble was not only the world's first multi-level shoot-em-up, it was also the first of its type to feature a re-fueling system. These innovations helped to ensure that Scramble was a well deserved commercial success for Konami. 


This game was the first title to use the 'Scramble Hardware', which was later used for "Super Cobra", "Lost Tomb", "The End" and a number of other titles. Many of these titles were actually bootlegs of other games, such as Namco's "Pac-Man". This was because Konami neglected to give Scramble ANY copy protection whatsoever; making it incredibly easy to run just about anything that used a Z80 processor, which, at the time, was pretty much every game out there. There were, of course, a lot of Bootleg copies of Scramble itself floating around, such as "Explorer" or "Strafe Bomb".


Scramble is considered the first in the "Gradius" series acording to the Nintendo Game Boy Advance "Gradius Galaxies" intro sequence.


This game had a Bulgarian bootleg called "Memory Devices Facility" ("&#1047;&#1047;&#1059;" or "&#1047;&#1072;&#1074;&#1086;&#1076; &#1079;&#1072; &#1047;&#1072;&#1087;&#1072;&#1084;&#1077;&#1090;&#1103;&#1074;&#1072;&#1097;&#1080; &#1059;&#1089;&#1090;&#1088;&#1086;&#1081;&#1089;&#1090;&#1074;&#1072;").


A Scramble unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.


- SCORING -


10 points per second of flying.


Missile on ground : 50 points

Missile in air : 80 points

UFO : 100 points

Fuel Tank : 150 points

Mystery Base : 100, 200, or 300 points

Main Base : 800 points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


A) Always watch what passes below you as you fly, especially in Sectors One through Four.


B) Ignore the 10 points added to your score every second : you want to finish each round quickly, because running out of fuel is bad news.


Try also to hit as many fuel tanks as you can, even in preference to mystery bases. One hundred and fifty points plus fuel is more desirable than an average mystery score of 200 points.


C) When you fuel gets low, the rule is to ignore everything but speed survival, and getting more fuel.


D) In Sector One, fly close to the ground. Your object should be scoring points rather than precise maneuvering, so keep in mind just a few simple rules : 

1. Fly slowly only when you must to destroy a rich cluster of targets.

2. Release a couple of bombs just as you top each mountain, then descend quickly into the valley.

3. Once there, shoot any threatening rockets by slowing down for a second and using your laser. Descend to the lowest plateau at the earliest opportunity, shooting lasers constantly to clear your path of targets.

4. Rise with the terrain, using your laser against targets in the foothills, and go all the way up only when the next mountain forces you to.

5. After the last mountain, be prepared for the UFOs.


E) Through Sector Two, simply fly relatively low at medium speed, pressing LASER and BOMB constantly. The laser shots will take care of almost all the UFOs in your way. If one or two survive until you reach them, shift to full speed until you pass them, dodging vertically if necessary.


Try to time the release of your bombs so that they hit fuel tanks, compensating for your middling speed.


F) Don't try to stay alive among the fireballs. Staying below them makes sense for two reasons - you keep your jet, and you even have a chance to pick up some points from the sparse targets below.


As for making if from valley to valley, just go where the fireballs aren't. Fly quickly through each valley, then stop just before you leave shelter. Wait there until a fireball passes just over you; then chances are that you will have a second in which to duck swiftly over and into the next valley. You will find there is definitely a rhythm to it.


G) If you fly through the city too fast, you might not be able to react in time to a juicy cluster of targets or to a rocket rising in your path. Fly at medium speed, lasering and bombing for all you are worth, especially at rockets in front of you and fuel tanks beneath you.


When you fly over silos too deep for your bombs to penetrate, accelerate for a moment in case the rockets suddenly take off toward your underside.


Treat a low roof just as you would a Sector One valley; descend and laser the row of targets into oblivion. Be careful, though, when reascending; the rises here are much more abrupt than Sector One.


H) Without excellent vertical control, you will never make it through Sector Five. Blasting away the fuel tanks blocking your path is vital, but requires much less of your concentration than does piloting the jet through such a tortuous maze.


As soon as you emerge from a passageway, stop. Then move up or down, whichever you need, as far as you can until the screen catches up with you and pushes you forward. Keep the joystick to the left; while the screen propels you, you should have time to find just the right height for entering the next passage.


Once you are in the next passage, speed up right away, giving yourself a head start for the next cavern; you will have to stop once again when you enter it. The cycle requires concentration even once you know the rhythm.


Sometimes, you will enter a cavern at top left and need to leave it through a passage at bottom right, but fuel tanks will block the mouth of the passage, cluttering even the cavern floor. If you are worried about crashing into these tanks from above before you have a chance to laser them, just drop a couple of bombs at the right moment in your descent. The tanks will stand in your way no longer.


I) Once you know its secrets, the base may actually be slightly easier than Sector Five. To destroy the enemy octagon, all you have to do is gun your engine before you enter its canyon, then pull sharply down and back, and nose up to it. If you are on its level, fire your laser; if just above, drop a bomb. You will destroy the base.


You will also crash your own ship, but no matter : you will start the next round with a free replacement. Most players are afraid of crashing, so they fly too high for their bombs to have any hope of reaching the base. Eventually, they crash or run out of fuel.


J) By now, you have probably realized the one step essential to mastering SCRAMBLE; memorization. Since the pattern repeats itself every round, being prepared for upcoming opportunities and dangers is what the game is about.

Sea Wolf II (c) 1978 Midway.


The game screen is a side view of a underwater scene (with the surface towards the top). You control a crosshair at the surface level. The object is to shoot as many ships as possible, before the time runs out. Your torpedoes are launched from the bottom of the screen, and must move upwards to hit the enemy ships (while avoiding the mines that float at different levels of the water). There are several different types of enemy ships, from slow moving destroyers, to fast moving PT boats. An 'explosion' light will flash inside your periscope each time you score a hit. Your submarine can shoot five shots before it has to reload (an automatic action that takes about a second). Your game will be extended if you reach a certain score before time runs out (the score is operator adjustable).

This game has one cool looking cabinet. It is in an upright format and is dark blue. The sideart is painted on, but is much more subdued than the art on the original "Sea Wolf". Two metal periscopes come down from the marquee area and attach down by the control panel area (or where the control panel would have been, if this game had one). The players look through their periscopes and move them to control the game. They have a fire button mounted on their right handle. The periscopes also have several transparencies inside which provide a cross hair, a display of remaining torpedoes, a reload light, and cause the explosion effect.


- TRIVIA -


Released in June 1978, Sea Wolf II is the first-ever sequel! It was basically the exact same game as its predecessor with a few cosmetic improvements. 


Still, at least one of the cosmetic tweaks in "Sea Wolf"'s case was a ground-breaker in its own right - though there's some argument over the fact, Sea Wolf II is generally thought to have been the first coin-op to use genuine colour, but was definitely not the first! Real color had been used as early as 1974 (in "Pace Car Pro") and possibly in 1973 (in "Wimbledon" and the "Color Gotcha"). These games, however, made very limited use of color (as did others, like Atari's "Sprint 8") and most of them didn't sell very well. Sea Wolf II, on the other hand, sold fairly well and may have been the first game to make extensive use of color. Sea Wolf II probably represents the very first 'modern' video game.


About 4,000 units were produced.

10,000 units were made. Sea Wolf has one of the all time great cabinets. It is in an upright format and is totally covered in painted sideart (submarine scenes done in white and three shades of blue). The marquee bulges out in front and has a large periscope which comes down from it. The player looks through the periscope and moves it to control the game. It has a fire button mounted on on one of the handles. The periscope has several transparencies inside which provide a cross hair, a display of remaining torpedoes, and a reload light. The monitor is mounted deep inside the machine and is displayed on a mirror. It is also covered with a blue overlay to give the game a bit of color. The monitor bezel area is covered in mock submarine gauges, but you can't even see them when playing, because you have to look through the periscope.


- TRIVIA -


Released in March 1976.


This is one of the all time greats. The whole game is played through a big periscope. This particular game is based on a much earlier electromechanical game from Sega (called "Periscope"), which was the first game ever to require 25 cents per play (a price the industry has been trying to raise for years now, an effort which has only been partially successful, despite over a decade of games requiring 50 cents or more. People just still expect for games to cost a quarter).

The main character is Super Joe from "Rush & Crash" and "Top Secret".


Bandai released a boardgame based on this video game (Commando) : A simple roll-and-move type game, with symbols on the board indiciating what happens when you land on that spot. There are multiple choices on which direction to go, but not too much in the way of required thinking. There are many different boards that you progress through, each 'board' representing one 'stage' of the game.


Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Capcom Game Music - 28XA-94) on 25/08/1986.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* The arch bridge is a dangerous spot so watch for grenade attacks from above. Be careful of trucks and jeeps that may try to run over you. Do not fall into rivers or ponds. Trees, walls and other obstacles may be used for cover.


* Here's A Hot Way To Kill The Soldiers Without Going Anywhere Near Them : At the end of each area, when the enemy soldiers are pouring out of the gate from their compound, move your commando to the bottom of the screen and shoot down. Your shots will come down from the top of the screen, killing the soldiers as they come out of the gate.


* This will let you rack up big points and all the extra men you can : On the first stage there is a cliff on the right side of the screen. The bad guys will jump off the end of this cliff and attack you. If you walk until the bad guys START jumping off and then stop you can stand there and kill them until you get sick of playing or until you reach the max extra men.

If you plan on playing thru the rest of the game you should stop at the max amount of extra men. If you just sit there the enemies will get faster and faster so the rest of the game will be harder.

Shadow Dancer - Kage no Mai (c) 1989 Sega.


A direct sequel to 1988's "Shinobi", Shadow Dancer features Hayate, a young Ninja who, together with his faithful pet dog, Yamato, must battle against a terrorist group known as the 'Asian Dawn'. The Asian Dawn have planted a number of time bombs throughout the metropolis and Hayate and Yamato have courageously set out to gather up all the explosives placed by the evil gang and to annihilate the criminal mastermind behind the Asian Dawn.


Shadow Dancer is set twenty years after the original game and introduces players to the new character of Hayate, son of Shinobi's original hero, Joe Musashi. Game-play is very similar to that of Shinobi's, and features the jumping and projectile weapon-based game-play of its illustrious older brother. However, a new and crucial attacking move has since been added to the Ninja's arsenal. Pulling DOWN on the joystick and pressing the ATTACK button sends the hero's dog to attack the nearest enemy. This will stop the enemy from attacking the player as he wrestles with the dog. The enemy must be killed quickly, however, or the dog itself will be killed. If the dog is killed, a small puppy appears, and once the player has killed a set number of enemies, the puppy will grow to be a full-sized dog who can once again be used to attack enemies.

This game is also known as "Kicker", and known in Japan as 'Shourinjihe no Michi' (translates from Japanese as 'Shaolin Road').


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Attack enemies when they are moving from floor to floor : When enemies are moving from floor to floor is a great opportunity to attack them! Attack them when they have landed!


* More points with jump kicks : You get 200 points if you take out an enemy. If you do so with a jump kick, you get 500 points! Take multiple enemies out at once and you get more points.


* Push bosses out of the screen : If you attack a boss and push him out of the screen, you can send him to the other side of the screen.


* Bring back the iron ball : After shooting an iron ball, press the control pad in the opposide direction to bring it back.


* You can pick up iron balls : If the time limit comes when you have an iron ball, the iron ball turns back to Ball 1 and flies away. Make use of this and press the kick button right before the time limit. The iron ball you have kicked turns back to Ball 1 at an ideal position and you can pick it up.


* Go for the green enemy : There are a bunch of enemies carrying items. Take them out and obtain all those items.


* Jump at heights : You incur damage if you get to a height difference while walking. If you jump and go down, you take no damage.

This game uses some strange color hardware, which required a unique monitor.


Sheriff was one of the last games that was designed to look like a "Bowling Alley". It has light colored woodgrain sides that actually look like they were made from the same wood as a bowling lane. They have a 'Sheriff' logo painted on the side in black, with a few graphics of Mexican bandits circling the machine near the bottom. The front of the machine has a huge coin door, and a speaker grill offset to the left of it (both of these are black). The control panel is done in red and features game instructions, start buttons for each player, and the controls. The monitor bezel goes all the way up to the top of the machine (no marquee on this title), and has a few more game instructions, some cowboy graphics, and a big 'Sheriff' logo done up to look like an American Flag. There were also two cocktail versions of this title made. The first was in a standard white topped first generation Nintendo cocktail ("Donkey Kong" used the same one with a different top). The second one was a god awful red and white contraption that looked like some sort of fantasy jukebox (this one used a smaller monitor and is fairly rare).


- TRIVIA -


After Sheriff's release by Nintendo in 1979, it was licensed to Exidy for re-release as "Bandido" in 1980.

A slightly redesigned version of 'Sheriff' is included as an unlockable extra on Nintendo's Game Boy Advance title 'Wario Ware Inc.: Mega Microgame$'. In this version, Wario is the 'dashing hero' instead of the cowboy from the arcade game; the gameplay and graphics are otherwise basically the same. 'Sheriff' also serves as the basis for one of 9-Volt's microgames during normal play.

This game is known outside Japan as "Mikie".


The classroom level of Mikie plays the song 'A Hard Day's Night' by The Beatles. The Gym Level plays 'Twist and Shout', the Medley/Russell song made famous by the Fab Four.


- UPDATES -


* Shinnyuushain Tooru-Kun : This is the original version. Mikie has red hair (because we all know that redheads are temperamental troublemakers :)). Football players are now Bulky Students (Classroom) or Police/Probation Officers (Garden). All of the students wear uniforms, including Mikie. Your classroom teacher wears a white shirt and is somewhat pudgier than his American counterpart. Many of the rooms also have a slightly different appearance and I believe the dance studio teacher wears glasses. Go figure.


* Mikie (High School Graffitti) : Aside from the noticeably different decor in the homeroom (all right, it's only the blackboard), there are several MAJOR differences in this MUCH harder version. Hearts that were normally in glass cases are stacked as piles of three hearts (you only have to time the last heart for Perfects). Furthermore, you can't headbutt in this version, you have to yell, which temporarily stuns enemies EXCEPT FOR your homeroom teacher, who cannot be stopped except by thrown items. Yelling is also much shorter range than headbutting, making timing crucial. Not a version for the weak-reflexed. Most importantly though is that if you take too long in a room, the Classroom teacher can throw what looks like either a necklace or dentures at you. On the plus side, you recover faster from a yell than a headbutt (less lag time) and enemies don't speed up as fast as they do in the other romsets (unfortunately, it seems as though the homeroom teacher will speed up on his own in this romset).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Test mode : hold Start1+Start2 during boot.


* Secret message : In game instruction scene between title screen and demonstration play, input the following code when player character sits on a chair : hold 1P Up + 2P Down then press 1P Start 4 times. "THIS SOFTWARE IS AN ORIGINAL PRODUCT OF KONAMI" should appears.

Shinobi (c) 1987 Sega.


A scrolling platform beat-em-up in which the player takes on the role of Joe Musashi, a Shinobi Ninja, who must fight his way through 5 tough missions - each made up of between 3 to 5 stages - in his quest to rescue the kidnapped Ninja children of the Iga clan; now hostages of an evil Ninja syndicate called "Zeed". To complete a mission, the player must rescue all of the kidnapped children on each level, with the number of hostages remaining displayed on a meter in the bottom left corner of the screen.


The Shinobi Ninja begins each level armed with either 'shuriken' throwing stars or a gun for long-range attacks; and a Samurai sword for close-range combat. In addition, the Ninja also has one 'Magic Attack' per level; a smart bomb which kills or damages all on-screen enemies. A points bonus is awarded whenever a level is completed without the Magic Attack being used. An end-of-level guardian awaits the player at the end of each mission, and each takes several hits before it is killed. Once a boss is defeated, the player is taken to a bonus stage in which a large number of Ninjas will try to 'jump' from the back of the screen to the front to attack the player. A bonus life is awarded if the player manages to kill all of the Ninjas without being attacked.


Shinobi was a huge success for Sega, and deservedly so. Its perfectly realized blend of platform and fighting action and is as fine an exponent of the 'easy to get into, difficult to master' gameplay ethic as video games have seen.

- TRIVIA -


Shinobi was one of the many names given to the ninja in feudal Japan. Its literal translation is 'stealer-in'; a reference to what Ninjas specialized in above all else. By employing any number of tricks such as stealth walking and staying upwind of any guard animals, the Shinobi went undetected about his mission. On a more devious level, the Shinobi was also a master of disguise, and would often 'steal in' to village communities disguised as a local, or into enemy palaces disguised as a wandering priest.


Marilyn Monroe's face appears on several posters in the Mission 1 second stage.


In 1988, Star released a bootleg of this game.

- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is very easy. Each enemy is worth 100 points with the exception of the Purple Guard and the Sword Throwing Guard which are worth 500 points. The bosses are 5000 points apiece. NOTE : The Purple Guards and Sword Throwing Guards are the ones that guard the hostages.


In addition to getting points from killing enemies, you can also score points for time left on the clock after you complete a level. You get 30 points per second of remaining time.


You can also receive special bonuses at the end of each level for certain actions :

1) If you don't use your ninja magic, you get a 5000 point bonus.

2) If you only use your Ninja-to sword (no Shurikens or gunfire), you get a 20000 point bonus.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Unless you are continuing, each game begins at 'Mission 1' and will have everything you need to complete each mission. Each level must be completed within 3 minutes, and all hostages must be rescued before you can exit the level. If you are killed, all hostages rescued prior to your death will still be recorded as rescued. In addition to melee attacks, you will also be able to use a specific Ninja Magic attack once per level. These magical attacks kill everything that is on the screen but you will be awarded a point bonus if you manage to complete a level WITHOUT using your Ninja Magic. The three Ninja Magic attacks are :

1) Multiple-Attack Magic : Allows you to gain lightning-fast speed to attack up to 12 times at once.

2) Tornado Magic : Brings about a magical tornado to blow your enemies away.

3) Lightning Magic : Causes the air to crackle with electricity and destroys your enemies.


* Some general gameplay guidelines :

1) Joe is strictly a one-hit, one-kill character, so you must avoid all enemy attacks or risk losing a life.

2) As you become more practiced at moving around, you won't have to rely on your distance weapons (throwing stars etc.) and can use your ninja sword for close-up kills; the advantage of this is that you can gain the 20000 point bonus. This also applies to the use of Ninja Magic.

3) Many of the enemies in the later missions will swarm Joe and attack in numbers, it's vitally important to learn to attack-and-jump as quickly as possible otherwise you will be quickly overun.

4) Your main goal is, of course, to rescue all the hostages to exit the level; and although three minute time limit initially seems quite generous, should you delay too long with the enemies, the time will quickly run out.

5) It's important to become good at the Challenge Levels, since this is the only way to gain extra lives. The Challenge levels will require you to take out around thirty ninjas who are trying to get to your position. There is no real hard and fast strategy other then take them down before they reach the second platform. Challenge Levels occur at the end of every mission.

6) Ninja Magic is a great thing. You must remember, though, that you can only use it once per level. This means you should only use it when you are totally surrounded by enemies and have no other means of escape.

7) All bosses take eight hits to defeat. Of course, you will have to hit them in the right place for that hit to register.


* Stop Gunners : In levels with Bazooka-toting enemies (Rounds 3-2), push one of them against a wall about ten times (always pushing on his direction, never stopping), you'll see then that all Bazooka men and Gun men are no longer able to use their weapons against you.


* Extra lives from hostages : In game are special hostage, you can get 1UP instead points from them. These hostages are : 2nd hostage on stage 2-2, 1st hostage on 2-3, 2nd hostage on 3-1, 5th hostage on 3-2. What you must do to get 1UP instead points? When you get hostage you must have 3 identical digits at end of your score (don't count last digit which is always 0). Example : 70000, 100000, 109990, 68880, 141110. 1UP icon will appear instead points icon over hostage.

Shock Troopers - 2nd Squad (c) 1998 SNK.


More of an update than a full-blown sequel, Shock Troopers - 2nd Squad picks up where the first game - released a year earlier - left off. Once again, one or two players face the might of a terrorist army who are threatening to destroy the world by launching a newly developed weapon-of-mass-destruction if their wishes - to be given absolute control of the newly-founded nation of Billberk - aren't granted.


Like many Neo Geo sequels, 2nd Squad doesn't particularly do anything the original didn't do. There are some improvements, however; graphics have been given a brush up and level design is a little more imaginative than that of the already impressive original.

Shock Troopers (c) 1997 SNK.


Shock Troopers pits the players against a mighty terrorist group who are holding a girl hostage, in order to force her grandfather to surrender a powerful drug which will enable the terrorists to control the minds of the grandfather's soldiers and create a huge, unstoppable army.


Shock Troopers is a multi-directional scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players that builds upon the foundations laid by Capcom's 1985 classic, "Commando (Capcom)" and also borrows heavily from Commando's sequel, '"Mercs". As well as enemy troops, players must contend with tanks, choppers and assorted military vehicles, and must also be careful to avoid any of the landmines that litter the levels. Extra weapons and health can be picked up from destroyed enemy vehicles, as well as being found in enemy supply crates. Shock Troopers is effectively three games in one as players can chose one of three different routes; each made up of different levels. The game also offers greater variety of gameplay than other of the genre; with levels having the players travel on the back of fast moving vehicles, climbing a rock face etc.

* A Trick : If you just hit the control key without setting your name after getting a high score, some of the default names you'll get are 'rat', 'dog', 'pig', 'rad'.

Side Arms - Hyper Dyne : Zettai Gattai (c) 1986 Capcom.


A horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up for 1 or 2 players. Each player has 2 fire buttons, one for shooting ahead and one for shooting behind; crucial for a game in which enemies attack from all directions. Shooting certain enemies will reveal power-ups - displayed as 'POW' icons - and shooting the icons will either change their type, or reveal a special weapon.


The 8 available power-ups are :

* Speed-up

* Speed-down

* Bit - (3 level power-up)

* Spread Gun - (3 level power-up)

* Mega Bazooka Launcher (2 level power-up)

* 3-Way Shot (2 level power-up)

* Auto I (Chain gun)

* Auto II (3-Way Auto)


Players are able to carry all of the game's available weapons simultaneously and can switch between each one to suit the situation. All weapons can also be powered-up by collecting a similar option. Finally, Side Arms features a unique power-up that is only available in the two-player game; both players can join together to become a single, highly powerful combat unit capable of firing in eight different directions. When joined, BOTH players' controllers can control the unit, which can cause problems if players decide to go in different directions from each other.

Side Arms - Hyper Dyne (c) 1986 Capcom.


An evil alien race called the 'Bozon' are trying to wipe out Mankind, and Lieutenant Henry and Sergent Sanders are given the responsibility of saving the Human Race. They each climb into a Mobilsuit - a jet-powered, heavily armoured combat suit - and set out on their mission.


Side Arms is a horizontally - and occasionally vertically - scrolling shoot-em-up for 1 or 2 players. Each player has 2 fire buttons, one for shooting ahead and one for shooting behind; crucial for a game in which enemies attack from all directions. Shooting certain enemies will reveal power-ups - displayed as 'POW' icons - and shooting the icons will either change their type, or reveal a special weapon.


Finally, Side Arms features a unique power-up. These power-ups are hidden in the level and can be collected by shooting at their location with any weapon.  By collecting a circle icon that flashed between the Greek 'Beta' and ok, both players can join together to become a single, highly powerful combat unit capable of firing in 8 different directions. When a 2 player unit is joined, BOTH players' controllers can control the unit's movement, which can cause the unit to not move if players decide to go in different directions to each other. The player who picks up this power-up will control the main weapon from his current list only and the other player will be able to fire the secondary 8 direction weapon. The 8 direction weapon can be fired by single presses or automatically by holding either fire button.


In a 2 player game, this form will break apart after one hit to the unit, returning to both players individual units. In a 1 player game it will break apart after 2 hits, causing the second unit to be destroyed. 


Apperance of the super unit and the 8 directional weapon is dependant on which player gets the power-up. First player unit is a primarly orange unit that fires red triangle projectiles one way. Second player unit is blue that fires blue boomerangs that fly out and return causing a slower rate of fire. 

The 8 available power-ups are :

* Speed-up (POW symbol)

* Speed-down (Reverse POW symbol, shows just before reaching Auto I or II)

* Bit - (3 level power-up)

* Spread Gun - (3 level power-up)

* Mega Bazooka Launcher (2 level power-up)

* 3-Way Shot (2 level power-up)

* Auto I (Chain gun)

* Auto II (3-Way Auto)

Side Track (c) 1979 Exidy.


Side Track is a black & white man-versus-machine game where the goal is to pick up all of the waiting passengers with your train while avoiding the computer-driver 'killer engine' which aims to take you out in a head-on collision. You can control your train via the 'fast' button which allows you to temporarily increase your speed on the tracks. You can also use the joystick to switch between several tracks at various junction points.


Each time you make a complete circuit around the track and pass the start marker on the outside track, another car is added to your train.

- TRIVIA -


Released in April 1979.


Side Track is the first of several games that were developed on a common Exidy platform which would eventually become host to their most popular games. Early revisions of the platform - Side Track included - had custom sound generators tailored for each game, along with a primitive tone generator that could play one of two very short preprogrammed sequences of notes (Later games eventually included a common sound system).


- SCORING -


Passengers picked up from the outermost track are worth 10 points.

Passengers picked up from each successive inner track are worth an additional 10 points.

On top of that, passengers picked up when you have additional cars in tow add another 10 points to car.

In the non-Japanese version (set 1 in MAME), the dipswitch for coin A corresponds to what is typically the left coin input, and dipswitch B corresponds to the right.

In the Japanese version (set 2 in MAME), the dipswitches are swapped, so that dipswitch B corresponds to the left coin, and A to the right. The 1st set also does not display the Japanese warning screen.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Double Bonus : When the big flying ship comes (the one in 4 pieces) that gives you one bonus for each player, fire repeatedly on the second piece before it is in place. If it is destroyed before it is in place, you will be given two bonuses per player instead of one.


* At the end of level 5 : When you arrive to the final enemy, around the hand pointing up of the statue there are two hidden icons. You can fire up with the jeep (or diagonal with the chopper), and you will see that your shots gets stopped by something invisible. If you keep firing, finally two new icons will appear (of course you don't have to kill the final enemy). Take this icon, and you will have a bonus. The bonus depends on your rank. If you have the Eagle rank you will earn 500,000 bonus points. If you don't have it, then you will earn 100,000 bonus points and the Eagle rank.

The Simpsons (c) 1991 Konami.


A jewel heist gone wrong sees Mr Burns's sidekick, Smithers, kidnapping Maggie and making his escape. Between one and four players take on the role of either Homer, Marge, Lisa, or Bart in this colorful, horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up from Konami. Each Simpsons character possesses an attacking move specific to them; Marge is armed with a vacuum cleaner, Lisa has a skipping rope, Bart has his skateboard, and Homer fights with his fists. The players must battle their way through a variety of Simpsons-themed levels - such as Springfield and Krustyland - fighting goons, thugs, zombies, drunks, firemen, and several Simpsons regulars. Many Simpsons characters that don't appear as enemies have 'cameo' scenes in the game (Otto working at a burgerstand in Krustyland, for example). The archetypal 'boss' character awaits the players at the end of every stage. The game ends with a final showdown with the evil Mr. Burns in his luxurious mansion.


The Simpsons was designed to Konami's typically-high production standards and was, like the 'Ninja Turtles' games that appeared a couple of years' earlier, very faithful to its source material. The colorful, smoothly-animated sprites captured the spirit of the legendary cartoon superbly, and the game's many humorous touches were timed to perfection.


- TECHNICAL -


There were several distinct versions of this game available in the arcade, the 4-player dedicated cabinet, the 4-player conversion kit (designed to retrofit "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", but a lot of them ended up on "Gauntlet" machines too), and the 2-player conversion kit (designed to retrofit almost anything). The only real difference in game-play between versions was the maximum amount of players. The Simpsons dedicated cabinet was fairly large and had an over-sized control panel (to accommodate 4 players). The sides were decorated with painted side-art showing all five members of the Simpsons family scampering around (Homer seems to be stepping on the tail of the family cat). Some cabinets may have this same scene as a large sticker, instead of it being painted on. American machines are usually blue in color, while the European ones were usually white. The marquee shows a family photo and has a 'The Simpsons' logo done in yellow. The control panel repeats the graphics from the marquee and has 4 joysticks (one for each player), each of which is a different color. Different Simpsons machines will have different sized monitors, although 25'' and 32'' were the most popular sizes available.

- TRIVIA -


Released in April 1991.


This video game is based on the prime-time animated series of the same name created by Matt Groening.


The Simpsons and "Aliens" arcade machines can be seen in the background of the 'Moe's Tavern Stage'. Ever wonder why the Aliens arcade game makes a cameo appearance in The Simpsons? It turns out that both The Simpsons tv show and Aliens (the movie) are made by 20th Century Fox (and of course, Konami got the rights to make the arcade games for both franchises).


Some stuff related to the TV series :

* In the character profiles, Lisa is said to be age 7. In the TV series, she is 8 years old.


* In the Character profile, Homer's age is 35. His real age is 36. Konami goofed that one.


* Bart wears a blue shirt in this game. In the series, he normally wears an orange shirt. The blue shirted Bart appeared on various T-shirts and other Simpsons merchandise. This was even referenced in one episode of the series. Homer was waving Lisa (who wears a red dress) around to attract a bull's attention. Then Homer says 'Now for some calming blue', and reaches for Bart. Seeing that Bart is wearing an orange shirt, he says 'Where's your blue shirt?'. Bart replies 'I don't have a blue shirt'.


* In some parts of the game, the bow in Maggie's hair is pink. Other times, it is the correct blue color.


* The rabbit characters that appear in various places in the game are from Matt Groening's comic strip, 'Life in Hell'.


* Smithers is much more evil in this game than he has ever been in the show. In the series, Smithers is (as Burns himself put it) 'the sober Yin to [Burns'] raging Yang'. In this game he is depicted as a cape-wearing, bomb-throwing psycho. Smithers' voice is wrong - Smithers is colored wrong. The color scheme used in this game appears to be based on the episode 'Homer's Oddysey', in which Smithers was colored incorrectly. In this episode, his skin color was also incorrect : instead being yellow, it was a dark pink color. Also, Smithers has never worn a cape, as he does in this game (Perhaps he has an evil twin who is a cape-wearing mad bomber!).


* Mr. Burns' voice also sounds wrong, except when he says 'Excellent'. The 'Excellent' voice sample was taken directly from the show and the rest of the lines were recorded by a different actor.


* SPOILER ALERT! : After Mr. Burns has been defeated, his eyes turn into Xs as he is lying on the ground. In the series Bart's eyes were drawn as Xs in a dream sequence, when Bart was imagining that school bully Nelson Muntz had beaten him to death and the school nurse had reconstructed his face for his funeral.


* In this game Sideshow Bob helps you by giving you food that restores your health. Since a first season episode where he framed Krusty the Klown for armed robbery and his plans were foiled by the Simpson kids, he is normally a villain. It seems that this game was made before the first season was finished (Or at least the people who worked on the game hadn't seen all of the episodes yet).


* The 'Moe's Tavern' stage in this game does not look much like it's TV counterpart. In this game it seems to be underground and only accessible by hidden elevators (One of the elevators is in a fake 'Krusty' grave in the cemetary stage, the other in a wall of rock in the 'Springfield Butte' stage). Of course, in the series it is just a regular building with a regular door that people walk through off the street.


* In this game, Barney's hair color is the same color as his skin (yellow). He appeared this way in a few early episodes of the first season, but later his hair was colored brown and only the Simpson kids have hair that is the same color as their skin.


* Channel 6 (Stage 7) : The anchorman in this stage is the same one that appears in the episode 'Call of the Simpsons'. In that episode, this anchorman sounds just like Kent Brockman, but looks completely different. The anchorman's hair was colored gray in the episode, but in this game the anchorman is colored like Scott Christian (Early on in the series, an anchor named Scott Christian would frequently be 'filling in for Kent Brockman', the regular anchorman. Eventually Christian was dropped from the series and they just used Kent Brockman). This anchorman is neither Kent Brockman or Scott Christian. If you stand in front of the anchorman, he will get mad. If you jump up on the anchor's desk, he will shrug his shoulders.


In Stage 7, in the scene where you fight ninjas, the sign reads "Utabuwaza" which means "Song Dance Skill".


- UPDATES -


* In the Japanese version, there are nuclear bombs laying around that can be thrown at enemies (for example, in front of the Noiseland Arcade in the first level). These bombs are not present in the other versions. These bombs look the same as the ones Mr. Burns shoots at you on the last level.


* In the Japanese version, you can fill you life meter past full. For example, if your life meter is already full and you get an item that restores your health, you get no benefit in the non-Japanese versions. But in the Japanese version, you will get additional health points, indicated in the meter by a different color (When the life meter is full, it is purple. When it goes past full, the additional health is shown in yellow).

Sinistar [Upright model] (c) 1983 Williams.


YOUR INTERGALACTIC CRYSTAL-MINING MISSION takes you to the antipodes of the known universe. But your parametric DeepSpace scanner faithfully displays the sector of the galaxy you presently occupy (including an area fully 3 parsecs across, no less)!


KEEP THE GALAXY SAFE for all it's sinizens! Fiendish Worker ships from the planet Sporg will attempt to fabricate a Sinistar from the remains of derelict planetoids in your very sector. You must not let them do this for two reasons :

1) These planetoids contain the life-sustaining crystals that your civilisation requires for its vital technologies.

2) With the eminently unstable Sinistar in their possession, the Sprogites can lay waste to any civilization in your sector. You alone stand in their way.


YOU MUST MINE THE SINISITE CRYSTALS. Williams has equipped you with the latest heuristic electret cannon technology. All you need to do is aim at a planetoid and shoot. Now collect your motherlode!


IN FACT, ONLY WITH SINISITE CAN YOU MANUFACTURE SINIBOMBS to eradicate the Sinistar. But you must also rebuff the Workers and disintegrate their even more aggressive comrades-at-arms, the evil skelomorphic Warriors! Intelligent beings everywhere depend on your courage, your dedication, your reserve, your shrewd command of tactical invention! It's up to you space cadet!

- TRIVIA -


Released in February 1983.


Also released as :

"Sinistar [Cockpit model]"

"Sinistar [DuraMold model]"


This game was originally going to be called "Juggernaut", then "Darkstar". The prototype version called Sinistar is a machine that was displayed at the November 1982 AMOA show in Las Vegas. The revision 2 was the most common version of the game.


The game is jokingly referred to as 'Opie-Star' at Williams' offices, because Sinistar's 'Run, Coward!' taunt sounded like he's saying 'Ron Howard' (acclaimed actor and director).


Sinistar's phrases :

'Beware I live'

'I hunger'

'I hunger coward'

'Beware coward'

'Run coward'

'Run run run'

'I am Sinistar'


A Sinistar unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames'.


A Sinistar unit appears in the 1984 music video, 'Almost Over You' by Sheena Easton.


- UPDATES -


PROTOTYPE (AMOA) :

* The Sinistar logo in the attract mode uses a Rocky-Horror-esque 'dripping blood' font.

* The letter 'T' shows up behind the 'dripping blood' logo, possibly part of the trademark?.

* The Sinistar death sequence sometimes occurs offscreen.

* There seem to be more crystals per planetoid than in the release revision.

* Missing the 'set attract mode message' option in the game adjustments screen.

* High score entry uses fire to advance to the next character, rather than the joystick.

* Warping to the next level can occur in any direction, not just upper-right.

* Sinistar's 'roar' occurs multiple times in rapid succession, cutting off each time he is hit by a sinibomb.

* When a player's ship is destroyed by the Sinistar, it explodes rather than spinning out first.

* After defeating Sinistar, his face outline doesn't appear in the center of the screen.

* You can set the extra ship points AND extra ship point factors to ZERO. As soon as you get a point, the game program gets caught in an infinite loop. You'll also hear an EXTENDED extra ship noise. You can break the loop by hitting advance and looking at ALL the extra ships you just received.

* Stuff (like the Sini-bombs, warriors and even the Sinistar himself (if it has a gender)) doesn't travel well from scanner to playfield and these objects can make quick second passes and sometimes even just skip the playfield all together.

* Survivors Today Has the following initials when tables are cleared : YYY XYS MAA AAA AAA AAA BDG MAA AAA AAA ABC EJS MAA AAA AAA RED HPG MAA AAA AAB CFL XYS MAA AAA AAB DGN DBG MAA AAA BCE.

* Scores start at 19045 and are listed with the following algorithm (-265, -365, -265, repeat).


REVISION 2 :

* Added 'Set Attract mode message' option in the game adjustments menu.

* The Survivors Today has the following initials (the initial are mostly those of the people who contributed programming, artwork, sound, playtesting or ideas (or a little of each)). Note : They keep the same order, but rotate position every time the machine is reset. :

Crystal : 200 points.

Warrior : 500 points.

Sinistar Piece : 500 points.

Destroying Sinistar : 15,000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Programming Credits And Williams message :

1) Set lives to 1 (this is optional, it merely saves time).

2) Insert one credit.

3) Bump into a Planetoid (rock).

4) Push the fire button 7 times.

5) Avoid Planetoids and Workers, don't fire at anything and get shot by a Warrior. If you set lives to 1, the game will now be over. If not, lose all lives in this manner until the game ends.

6) Enter initials.

7) Press the 2 Player button 3 times, then insert one coin and start a new 1 Player game.

8) Don't move or fire, just push the Sinibomb button once.


There are now two messages which can be displayed for the credits :

9) Insert 3 coins, then push the Sinibomb button again. The 'crossword' credits should now be displayed.


* For the Williams Electronics message :

10) Simply end the game by getting shot without hitting a Planetoid or firing, then push the 1 Player button to display the message.


* 255 Lives Trick : This little trick is harder than the game itself, but worth it if you pull it off. On your last man, make sure a warrior fires at you just as Sinistar sucks you in. As the Sinistar sucks you in, you will lose your last man, but when the warrior's bullet hits you, you will have one less than zero ships.

Note : The warriors stop shooting as soon as you are 'caught' by Sinistar. The game was programmed this way, to prevent you from dying twice. Since you are trying to die twice, you have to let a warrior shoot at you, before you get sucked in, then hope that the shot hits you after you have been sucked in. This is very tricky.

Note 2 : 8-bit processors can only handle values from 0-255, for a total of 256 values. Therefore, 'one less than zero ships' will roll around to 255.

Skull & Crossbones (c) 11/1989 Atari Games.


Skull & Crossbones is a swashbuckling adventure in which players portray two pirates competing for food, drink, booty, and revenge. Players use a joystick and button to control the unique sword-fighting action.


The game begins with an encounter with the evil Wizard, who robs our heroes of all of their booty. The pirates swear revenge and set off on a quest to destroy the Wizard and recover their treasure.


The adventure takes them around the world. The pirates battle the fierce captains and crews of opponent ships. They encounter the soldier guards and the merciless Executioner in the Spanish castle. In the ninja camp they fight the Ninja Master and his followers. On the beach the heroes encounter the dreaded Medusa and a horde of wicked skeletons that rise from the dead.


Finally, the pirates reach the Wizard's Island, where they must again do battle against the shadow figures of the Executioner, the Ninja Master, and the Medusa before they can fight face-to-face with the evil Wizard. If they make it to the throne room and overcome the Wizard, players are rewarded with a room full of treasure.


Players use a joystick and sword button in a combination of defensive and offensive maneuvers to battle the various enemies. Players can learn the lunge and back-slash, two. skilled sword-fighting moves that are the most effective.


In order to increase the long-term appeal of the game, players can select various difficulty levels of easy, medium, and hard to vary their paths through the game. By selecting the longer hard path, players are rewarded with more food, drink, and booty along the way.

Atari Games made most of these as dedicated cabinets. They also made a conversion kit to retrofit existing games. This kit was most evil, because it was one of the few kits that had a marquee and control panel overlay big enough to fit a "Dragon's Lair" machine (the marquee was even three-fold, just like the Dragon's Lair one). Most of these games were converted within months. Very few original games remain today, and Atari quickly dropped the game from their lineup.

*  Stand over the white crossed bones that mark the spot of buried treasure and press the sword button to dig it up. Walk over the treasure to collect it.


*  In order to get the highest score, first start the digging, then battle the opponents on each screen. Collect all the treasure before moving on to the next scene.


*  The most difficult opponents in each wave (ship captains, Executioner, Ninja Master and Medusa) each protect a special treasure. By destroying these enemies, the players are given the special item that will protect them in the final round on the Wizard's Island. In a two-player game, the two players must duel over these special treasures.

This is quite a fun game, where you score points for landing on an ever decreasing patch of 'good' land. Why 'good'? As you descend without opening your parachute your landing point becomes smaller, but the points become higher, just don't leave pulling the ripcord too late because the Newtonian laws concerning gravity is working against you.

Sky Kid (c) 1985 Namco.


Sky Kid is a 2-D, scrolling shooter type of game. You play as the character Sky Kid. Sky Kid flies around in a bi-plane and is assigned specific targets during the missions. These missions involved bombing specific targets. This would seem easy, however, there are a few obstacles Sky Kid must overcome to get to the target safely. First, the bi-plane is not equipped with the bomb. Sky Kid must pick up the bomb enroute to the target. Second, there are both ground and air units that attempt to keep Sky Kid from accomplishing his mission. Last, Sky Kid may have to navigate through some very inhospitable terrain or navigate around cities in order to get to the target. The targets that Sky Kid must bomb will either be a fortress complex or a ship. As one moves farther up in the missions, it isn't uncommon to have multiple targets in one mission. Perhaps barnstorming would have been a better idea.

- TRIVIA -


Released in December 1985.


After Namco ended its partnerships with both Midway and Atari, they started to release games in the United States. Releases such as "Gaplus", "Galaga 3", and "Dig Dug II" were some games that Namco released. Since the big arcade collapse of the early 80's had claimed quite a few arcade companies, Namco managed to fill the gap. Sky Kid was a game that didn't enjoy great success in the United States. The game, however, did show that Namco was on the right track as far as games they released. Featuring cartoon-like graphics and different types of missions, Sky Kid would form the basis of several other Namco games based on the same type of gameplay. To this day, Namco is either releasing new arcade games or it is releasing old classics for the different gaming systems.


Sky Kid is the first game from Namco to allow play for two players simultaneously.


- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is kind of complicated. You get points for destroying air and ground targets. You then get additional points for how many of these types of targets you destroyed. In addition, you get points based on how much of the target you destroyed.


* Ground Targets :

Truck : 100 points

Tank : 200 points

AA Gun : 100 points


* Sea Targets :

AA Boat : 100 points

Submarine : 100 points


* Air Targets :

Planes : 100 points

Balloon : 100 points

Bomber : 100 points

Bomb : 100 points


* Bomb Hits :

Direct hit, target totally destroyed : 1000 points

Indirect hit, target partially destroyed : 500 points


You will receive a bonus after you land. This bonus depends on how many of each type of the above targets you destroyed. It is listed in the order of :

Ground and Sea Units

Air Units

Mission Target or Targets


For the first two items, the scoring is:

Units Destroyed : 10-19 - 1000 Points

Units Destroyed : 20-29 - 3000 Points

Units Destroyed : 30-39 - 5000 Points

Units Destroyed : 40-49 - 10000 Points

Units Destroyed : 50 and UP - 20000 Points


In regard to targets, bonus points are scored on whether you totally destroy or partially destroy the target or targets.

Partial Destruction :  2000 points

Total Destruction : 10000 points


You will also get 10 points per second that you are in the air.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, Sky Kid will be at his airfield in the lower right of the game screen. When the mission starts, you will take off from that airfield. Keep in mind, this is a scrolling game. This means you can go no faster then the left side and no slower then the right side. You can, however, vary your speed in-between by pushing the joystick back and forth. The biggest key in getting through this game is learning how to use the joystick to speed up and slow down because you will sometimes be put into some very tight areas that will require precision joystick control.


* Remember the controls on this game are not ''reversed''. This means that this isn't like a normal plane where pushing up causes the plane to dive and pushing down causes the plane to rise. Instead, the directions of the joystick will be the direction of the plane.


* Everything that isn't air is hazardous to Sky Kid's plane. This means don't go flying through the forests, cities, or billboards or you will have one less plane.


* Ground units (except trucks) attack in two manners :

a) The tanks just throw up a wave of bullets toward your plane. They aren't very precise but sometimes the volume is enough to knock your plane out of the sky.

b) The anti-aircraft guns fire what is called a ''proximity'' fuzed shell. These types of shells don't have to directly hit the plane to be lethal. Instead, they explode at a pre-set altitude and throw shrapnel in different directions. If Sky Kid's plane gets caught by any of this shrapnel, the plane is lost.


* The sea units also attack in two manners :

a) The anti-aircraft boats throw the 'proximity' fuzed shell.

b) Submarines throw up a wave of bullets then rapidly submerge.


* Enemy fighters will appear both from in front of and also behind Sky Kid. This basically means that ''hugging'' the left or right side of the screen is a bad thing since a collision is highly probable.


* Enemy fighters also seem to sense when Sky Kid's gunsights are locked on them. The enemy planes will do a loop and end up going in the opposite direction over Sky Kid. Keep this in mind when shooting at them since this could cause a collision.


* Just because Sky Kid's plane has been shot full of holes doesn't mean that all is lost. Once your plane has been shot, rapidly press the loop button and you may recover out of the shoot down. Of course, you need to do this right after you have been shot or it won't work.


* When Sky Kid is performing a loop, enemy units cannot hit him with fire. Of course, the disadvantage is that it puts Sky Kid at a higher altitude and it also may place him right in the way of an enemy air unit.


* During the first few missions, the bomb is relatively easy to get. As the missions progress, however, the bomb gets harder to retrieve. Sometimes it will be in a little spot between two trees or it may be at the bottom of a deep valley. Adjust speed and direction accordingly.


* Before you get to the bomb, a prompt 'GET THE BOMB' will appear on the screen a couple of seconds before the bomb gets into view.


* In order to fully destroy a target, you must plant your bomb right in the middle of it.  You will know you have scored a direct hit because the target will explode and then sink.


* Speaking of targets, they are usually heavily defended. Not just by the outside units, but also by the volume of fire they can throw skyward to shoot down your plane.


* When you are approaching your airfield to land, make sure that you aren't in one of your enemy's gunsights. Enemy units sometimes will fire on you until you get on the runway. Nothing like almost getting to the airfield only to get shot down.


* As the missions progress, the distances also get longer. You will know how far you are when the prompt 'HALFWAY POINT' shows up on the screen. If you get shot down before the halfway point, you start from the airfield. If it is after the halfway point, you start from the halfway point.


* If you shoot the dancing girls around the airfield when you are coming in, they turn into pink flowers.  Not worth any points but I guess a great way to line up your gunsights.


* If you overshoot the runway, you will run out of fuel and crash. You still, though, get the extra bonuses but you lose a plane in the process.


* Make sure you watch the terrain at all times. Sometimes mountains, billboards, cities, etc. will appear at the worst possible times. Of course, you can also use these to your advantage since enemy air units also get destroyed by these features

Smash T.V. (c) 1990 Williams.


The year is 1999. Television has adapted to the more violent nature of man. The most popular form of television remains the game show. One show in particular has dominated the ratings. That show is SMASH TV.The most violent game show of all time. Two lucky contestants compete for cash and prizes. Each contestant is armed with an assortment of powerful weapons and sent into a closed arena. The action takes place in front of a studio audience and is broadcast live via satellite around the world. Be prepared. The future is now. You are the next lucky contestant!


Smash TV Game Rules :

1. Move with LEFT joystick to avoid enemies and gather prizes (cash and game show gifts).

2. Fire weapons with RIGHT joystick and collect power-up icons for increased firepower.

3. Advance to next game arena when enemies are gone.

Released in June 1990.


A superb sequel to 1982's legendary single screen shoot-em-up, "Robotron - 2084". The Classic Robotron game-play is enhanced further with the addition of power-ups and imaginative and challenging end-of-level bosses. The two-player game introduced a very high level of competitiveness as both players try to beat each other to the power-ups, prizes and keys.


The game seems to be based, at least in part, on the sci-fi action movie, 'The Running Man', starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. This movie itself was based on a book of the same name by Stephen King (under the pseudonym 'Richard Bachman').


One of Smash TV's more memorable elements was the game show host; at random intervals, a garishly suited, grinning host would pop up and enthusiastically announce such memorable sound-bites as, 'Total carnage! I love it!', 'I'll buy that for a dollar!' (taken from the 1987 movie Robocop), 'I love it!', 'Big money! Big prizes! I love it!'.


A Smash T.V. sequel was planned, but the project never got past the planning stage and nothing more was heard of it. While Smash TV has yet to see a fully-fledged sequel, it WAS followed by a semi-sequel in the form of 'Total Carnage'; a military-themed scrolling shoot-em-up which was housed in a cabinet very similar to that of Smash T.V.s and shared the same dual joystick controls. Upon completion of Total Carnage's incredibly difficult first level, a message screen appeared stating that "all Smash T.V. players should quit and flee from this machine" before Total Carnage's already high difficulty level increased further. A solid follow-up to an already challenging game.


On the 2005 video game "Grand Theft Auto - Liberty City Stories", there is a side-mission called 'Slash TV', which parodies this game, where the player's character is surrounded by enemies, and is awarded cash for eliminating waves of them. The camera angle changes from the game's traditional third-person to a slightly angled overhead view so it looks like the original.


- UPDATES -


Revision 1 :

* Software version 4.00.


Revision 2 :

* Software version 5.00.

* Added the 'Reset secret warp' (see 'Tips And Tricks' section for more info).

* Reduced difficulty (Factory setting : 3 (easy) instead of 5 (medium)).


Revision 3 :

* Software version 6.00.


Revision 4 :

* Software version 8.00.

* Added the famous 'Pleasure Dome'.

* Changed some 'in-game texts'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Secret Warp (Works on 5.00 and Up) : when you start a game of Smash T.V. on the first level, reset the machine, it'll take you to the 'Secret Warp 3' and take you to the third boss stages.


* Difficulty : the game is known to adjust its difficulty by the daily high score list. If the high scores are too high, making the game too hard, just reset the machine :).


* Don't try to conserve ammo. Your shots should be efficient and kill as much as possible, and you won't have time to think about conserving shots (especially in the latter stages). The pattern of moves you should follow at the end of each board to reach the easiest boards is :

Level 1 : right, up; and then you have no choices.

Level 2 : up, right; and then again, no choices.

Level 3 : right, right, down; and then you have no choices.


* When playing with 2 people, if one player finishes the level near an exit, the other will 'walk through the wall' to the next room. Can be useful on some levels.

Snow Bros. - Nick & Tom (c) 1990 Toaplan.


One or two players take on the roles of snowmen Nick and Tom as they battle a variety of monsters over fifty platform-based, single screen levels. The snowmen must throw snowballs at the enemies, eventually encasing them completely in snow. The encased enemies must them be kicked in order to destroy them. This is achieved by standing next to the snowball and pressing the "kick out" button, which sends the giant snowball flying around the screen, killing any enemies that lay in its path. During every 10th level, the players must face and defeat an end-of-level boss.


A number of power-ups are available, in the form of coloured potions. The power-ups are as follows :

* Yellow = Long shot

- TRIVIA -


Released in April 1990.


Like Taito's "Liquid Kids", Snow Bros. was licensed to Manchester's Ocean Software for conversion to both the Atari ST and the Commodore Amiga home computers but, again like "Liquid Kids", Ocean decided that the game wouldn't perform well at retail and the game was cancelled. It's not known how far into production Snow Bros was before cancellation, although several work-in-progress screenshots were published in the games magazines of the time.


This game was released as a conversion kit only (often factory installed in a generic cabinet), so any such machine could be converted into a proper Snow Bros. machine. This title is JAMMA compatible (the circuit board for it is one of the smallest ever made, it is barely larger than a Nintendo Famicom cartridge). The marquee for this title shows a ''Snow Bros.'' logo, with two snowmen, and a couple of cartoon enemies in the background - in keeping with the game's ''cute'' theme.


Licensed to Romstar for USA distribution.


A bootleg of this game is known as "The Winter Bobble".


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Out Zone, Snow Bros. - PCCB-00044) on 21/10/1990.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Killing all the monsters on a level with a single snowball causes money bonuses, worth 10,000 points, to fall down, but sometimes a glowing cake bonus will appear instead. When the cake is collected, the game stops and four blue snowball creatures appear for a short time. If these enemies are killed, they each provide a letter : 'S','N','O' or 'W'. Collect all four of these letters for an extra life. The glowing cake can also appear at other times during the game.


* Hidden Functions : If the 'Invulnerability dip switch' is enabled, you are invulnerable but you may also 'Pause' the game with P2 Start and restart with P1 Start.

Solar Fox is a space shooter and a Pac-Man-type game all in one. The playing field is square and only has walls on the outside. Each wall has a moving cannon mounted that will fire odd shaped torpedoes at your ship. Scattered around the inside will be a bunch of pellets in various simple patterns. To complete each level you have to drive over, or shoot all of the pellets. If done quickly enough the game will skip a level (going from 1 to 3, etc).

Solar Quest (c) 1981 Cinematronics.


In the center of the screen is a sun. Any space ships or ship's fire coming in contact with the sun are destroyed. The sun exerts an increasing gravitational pull as play progresses.


A player controlled space ship is randomly located on the screen. The space ship's movement is controlled by rotate right, rotate left, and thrust buttons. For quick escapes, the space ship can be thrust into hyperspace, causing the ship to disappear and then reappear in a different location.


The space ship possesses two weapons. The first weapon consists of shots fired by pressing the fire button. These shots will destroy any alien ships they strike, but will disintegrate if they do not hit any targets. The second weapon is a nuke which is launched by pressing the nuke button. The nuke will continue to travel across the screen until either it strikes a target or the player detonates the nuke by pressing the nuke button a second time. The nuke will destroy all alien ships within a limited radius of the explosion.


At the top of the screen is a display showing the player's score, the number of ships remaining, and the number of nukes a player has available.


The game consists of different phases. Each phase begins with several alien ships appearing from random points along the edge of the screen. The number of the alien ships is determined by the phase, with a maximum of eight ships for any single type of alien ship in a phase.


The alien ships move across the screen in a random pattern. After a predetermined time, dependent upon the phase, the alien ships will begin to chase the player's space ship. The player must shoot the alien ships before his ship is rammed by an alien ship. In later phases, the alien ships can shoot at the player's space ship as well as ram it.


Any alien ship that is destroyed by the player will leave a survivor. The player can either capture or kill the survivor. Survivors cannot be killed with nukes. If the survivor is neither captured nor killed, it will begin to drift towards the sun. Survivors disappear when they come in contact with the sun.


If the player does not shoot any alien ships, one or two ghost ships will appear and begin to chase the player's space ship. The ghost ship will shoot at the player's space ship during any phase. The length of time it takes for the ghost ships to appear shortens with each phase, until at least one is always present. A ghost ship will not leave a survivor when it is destroyed.


During a phase, seven different types of alien ships will appear. It is possible for several types of alien ships to be on the screen at one time. A phase is completed after all the alien ships have been destroyed or a specific amount of time has elapsed.


A player must be careful when using hyperspace. Excessive use will cause hyperspace to lock-out for a short period, making a player's space ship more vulnerable. A player's space ship cannot be destroyed in hyperspace.


As play continues, each phase becomes successively more difficult; the number of alien ships increases, the length of time before the alien ships attack shortens, and the alien ships firing capability activates. When a player's space ship is destroyed, play resumes at the same point. The game ends when all of a player's space ships are destroyed.


1- and 2-player options are available. In the 2-player mode, players alternate until all their ships are destroyed. If 1-player receives more extra ships than another, he will be allowed to play the extra ships even though his opponent's game is over.


An extra nuke is awarded every 10,000 points. An extra space ship is awarded after capturing a specified number of survivors.

Solar Quest machines came in a white upright cabinet with a black front section. The side-art covered the top half of the machine, and showed a scene of a white spaceship and a sun on a blue background, along with the title. The marquee was black and had the Solar Quest logo superimposed over a multicolored explosion. The control panel and monitor bezel were blue and decorated with small spacecrafts zooming to and fro. The control panel has no joystick. Play is instead controlled with six buttons. It seems that most vector games had buttons instead of joysticks, they were probably just following what "Asteroids" did. This game uses a black and white vector open frame monitor, but it has several color overlays installed to make the sun yellow, and the top of the screen red. The monitor is actually installed deep inside the machine, and the player views a reflection of it, instead of the actual screen.

This was the last 'Black and white with a color overlay' vector game produced by Cinematronics. Solar Quest was a last minute game. Cinematronics was heading towards the trade show season with only "Boxing Bugs" to show, which they felt was not a winner. Scott Bodden who had left the company earlier, was called in as a contractor to write Solar Quest. He completed this in a mere 90 days.

Solomon's Key - Solomon no Kagi (c) 1986 Tecmo.


A superb and addictive platform/puzzle game in which a single player controls a wizard called 'Dana', whose quest is to retrieve "Solomon's key" and vanquish the demon hordes that have broken through into the world. To achieve this Dana must advance through the fifty rooms of 'Constellation Space', before finally reaching the magical key.


Each room has a key that Dana must collect. Once collected, the room's exit will open and the wizard must then try to find and/or create a safe route past the constantly spawning demons to reach the exit and progress to the next room. To enable him to do this, Dana is armed with a magic wand that can be used to both destroy and create granite blocks to use as platforms and barriers. Dana can remove existing blocks with his wand, and can remove blocks directly above him by repeatedly jumping up into them until they shatter.


Bonus Items litter each room, as well as being hidden in granite blocks, and collecting these will earn the player for extra points. Power-ups can also be found and picked up. These appear as potion bottles with a flame emblazoned on them. When used, Dana shoots a fireball which will start moving along the walls and platforms and will destroy the first demon it comes into contact with.


As well as the bonus items and power-ups, each level also has a hand bell which, when collected, will trigger the release of a trapped fairy. The fairy will slowly fly around the room and can be rescued for bonus points. An extra life is awarded for every ten fairies rescued.


The game's levels are set around the Zodiac star constellations. The main levels are divided into groups of four - making a total of fourty-eight standard rooms - with each group representing a separate constellation. In addition to the standard rooms, each constellation also has a secret bonus room that can only be accessed by finding the given constellation's 'Seal', which is located in the last room of each group. There are three further secret rooms - 'Page of Time', 'The Page of Space' and the 'Princess Room' - that are only accessible if the player has found the 'Hidden Seals of Solomon'.


The four room groups are :

1-4 Aries 5-8 Taurus 9-12 Gemini

13-16 Cancer 17-20 Leo 21-24 Scorpio

25-28 Libra 29-32 Virgo 33-36 Sagittarius

Released in July 1984.


This was Capcom's second game and their first released in the United States.


Son Son is Capcom's tribute to a Chinese legend called 'Xiyou Ji', meaning 'Journey to the West', considered to be one of the four classic pieces of Chinese literature (and a fairly good read). The main character in Xiyou Ji is Sun Wukong, or, when you pronounce the words as if they were Japanese kanji, Son Gokuu (hence the name Son Son).


This game features one of the first game soundtracks composed by Tamayo Kawamoto, who made also other Capcom 80's BGM. She now works at Taito : she's a member of Zuntata, the popular (well, in Japan) Taito band where she plays keyboards.

Another game inspired by "Space Invaders". This one is a more straightforward version, although after you finish off a rack a UFO starts working its way down; shoot it and you'll get a bonus (and maybe a free ship).

Video Games GMBH (located in the town of Lich in Germany) started as an unauthorized bootleg manufacturer (i.e. : Space Attack) founded by Mr. Reinhard Stompe. When the European countries changed their laws to protect the original creators, they started to develop their own arcade games. However, only two original games from Video Games GMBH are known to exist : "Super Tank" (1981) and "Looping" (1982). Video Games GmbH was sold to Ican Data GmbH (Munich) in 1987 for US $10 million.

Space Chaser (c) 1979 Taito.


Space Chaser is a 2-Dimensional maze racing game. You control your rocket through the maze to pick up the dots while at the same time avoiding the rocket, or rockets, that are constantly trying to ram you. Successfully get through one maze and many more await you. This is good practice for freeway driving in the big city.

Released in October 1979.


Also released as a Cocktail model : "T.T Space Chaser".


This is probably the most manic of the "Head-on" type of games, as instead of a car (or 2) you're trying to avoid a head-on collision with, you have a missile trying to ram into you. This gives added pressure, since you must be able to outrace the missile at the end of the round.


Maybe also known as "Missile Chaser".


- SCORING -


Dots : 10 points X level number. 

Levels start at 1 and go up to 9. After that level 9 keeps repeating itself.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* How to finish off the first screen :

1) Let your rocket finish off the half of the bottom row you are on, but turn around before you turn the corner. Turn towards the center when you get back to where you were.

2) Finish off the ten sets of two dots in the middle. Watch out for the missile trying to strike you. Although you should have no problem with giving your rocket a moment's needed boost, try to do as much as possible without boosting through the center. You'll need it later.

3) Take the circle of dots that surrounds the inner area. 

4) Go to the bottom row. You should have the left half of the bottom line ready. Go around, finishing the dots.

5) On the last row, hit the boost. You'll need it to finish.

Space Duel (c) 1982 Atari.


The Space Duel game is a 1- or 2-player game with a color X-Y video display. This display, with its 3-color guns and higher voltage, has the same technology that was used in previous Atari black-and-white X-Y displays. However, the screen now displays dazzling color and unique visual effects in a spectacular multi-dimensional video display.


Space Duel offers players a choice of 4 different game versions. One player can control a fighter or a space station. Two players, playing at the same time, can control fighters or a space station. The game offers players 12 different targets (7 split when hit), and 18 different waves. At the beginning of each wave, objects enter from the screen edge. The player(s) then tries to shoot and destroy the objects. The wave ends when all the objects are destroyed.


The play mode begins with the first wave. In the space station game, two ships appear near the center of the screen. The ships are joined together by a 'fuse'. In the fighter game, the red ship appears above the red controls. The green ship appears above the green controls. A sound is heard any time a ship appears on the screen.


A ship may fire as many as four shots on the screen at one time. However, if a ship is damaged, it may fire only one shot on the screen. Also the ship is slower to react. In space stations, a second hit to either ship destroys that ship. Then, the fuse between ships starts to burn, and the other ship explodes.


In the fighter game, players may shoot each other without losing a life. Instead, the ship blinks and disappears. After a period of time, the ship reappears in a different location. If one player loses all of his ships before the other player, his last ship returns to the screen as a damaged ship. It is possible to earn a bonus ship while damaged.


Shields protect a ship from all saucer shots and collisions. Shields wear out with time or if hit by targets. Space stations have more than twice as much shield energy as fighters.


In the first wave, spinners enter and break into two smaller pieces when shot. Each piece splits into two smaller pieces when shot again. Each of these pieces is destroyed when shot. Other targets split apart in the same manner.


At the end of each wave, a bonus wave begins and a low humming sound is heard. BONUS LEVEL, and the number of points for that level, flash on the screen. A box appears at the screen edge and ships cannot leave that boundary. Fuzzballs, stars and saucers enter and attack the player. A fighter, when shot by the other player, either just before or during the bonus wave, will not reappear until the next wave. The bonus wave ends when all targets are destroyed, or the humming sound reaches its highest pitch.


Other targets enter as the game progresses. When the number of targets is less than the wave number, or it no splitting targets have been hit in some time, saucer enters and shoots at targets and ships. The saucer shots become more accurate as play continues. Saucers may also enter as a pair. They shoot at, but do not destroy, each other. Anything caught between them will be shot. Each time the pair goes across the screen, the distance between them increases.


A player's ship may be destroyed by a shot or collision. Game play ends when all ships are destroyed.

Space Fever (c) 1979 Nintendo.


The Earth is under attack from alien invaders. Shoot them out of the sky before they land. Space Fever is Nintendo's take on the "Space Invaders" franchise. The game is almost identical in terms of how it plays. The alien craft are arranged in rows and they slowly move left and right across the screen. When the row reaches the edge, the ships drop down a row and move in the opposite direction. As you shoot more enemies the speed will increase, as will the number of enemy bullets. You have four blocks above you that absorb the enemy shots until they are worn through, and being hit by an enemy shot will cost you a life. Sometimes a UFO will fly along the top of the screen and can be hit for Bonus points.


There are three different game modes for 1- or 2-player games :

Game A - There are two 'blocks' of aliens that move in opposite directions to each other.

Game B - The aliens move as one 'block', but they only appear one row at a time.

Game C - The same as "Space Invaders" - all the aliens move as one 'block' in the same direction.

Space Firebird [Upright model] (c) 1980 Gremlin.


Space Firebird is a one or two player game in which players are attacked from all sides by highly maneuverable Firebirds. Players can move space ship left or right and shoot a rapid-fire laser at attacking Firebirds. A special Warp Mode allows the space ship to escape danger and fire at the flock of aliens.


FIREBIRDS

The space Firebirds are a unique set of adversaries. There are three different birds, the Emperor, Eagle and Gull, which fly together in complex looping formations, firing and attacking from all directions. The player must keep track of the laser hits because each bird has a different resistance level to hits. The fearless Emperor is destroyed by four hits, the Eagle with two hits and the soaring Gull with one hit. The Eagle also has a deadly bomb which is launched at the space ship. Extra points are scored by hitting the bomb before it explodes. The bomb when hit, scatters into deadly shrapnel. To avoid the flying shrapnel, the bomb must be hit from directly underneath.


SPACE SHIP

The space ship can be moved right or left to evade attacking Firebirds. Depressing the fire button enables the space ship to shoot its laser at approaching Firebirds. Players receive 3 (adjustable) space ships per play.


WARP MODE

Activate warp mode to escape impeding danger or to strike out at approaching birds. There is only warp mode per space ship. When activated, the space ship is launched into space with a force field around it that deflects enemy fire. In warp mode, Firebirds can be eliminated by ramming into them or by firing at close range.


If all Firebirds are destroyed, the player moves into a new battle sequence that increases in difficulty. One new space ship is awarded for a score of 5,000 (adjustable) points. Game ends when all space ships are destroyed.

Space Fury (c) 1981 Sega.


This game is a rather simple alien blasting shoot-em-up. It uses almost industry standard vector controls, which are four buttons, Left Rotate, Right Rotate, Thrust, and Fire. You begin the game in the center of four strange looking shapes. These shapes are both level selects and upgrades. Run into one of them and it will add itself to your ship, and then you get to do the level associated with it. Each level is different mainly because you have wildly different shot patterns on each one. But all of them are the same when it comes to your objective. What you have to do is blast all the spaceship parts before they can form into dangerous enemy spaceships. Blast them all, and you get to select a new level and watch a little interlude where the alien taunts you with his evil computer voice.


PLAY INSTRUCTIONS : 

1. Enemy ships will be formed by four craft coming together.

2. Only complete enemy ships can launch fireballs.

3. Partial enemy ships will try to ram the player ship.

4. Between rounds the player ship can dock for more firepower.

5. To dock destroy enemy fleet before reinforcements arrive.

- TRIVIA -


Released during July 1981. Space Fury was the first color vector graphic games. The most notable thing about that hardware platform is that the monitors would often catch on fire. You could lower the chance of this game catching fire by installing a monitor cooling fan and removing the back door.


Space Fury shipped in the Sega 'convert-a-cab', which was an attractive, but hopelessly generic arcade cabinet with woodgrain sides, and no sideart. Lots of different games came in this cabinet, it wasn't just for Space Fury. The rest of the decorations on this game looked rather amateur. The alien head and logo displayed on the marquee could have easily come out of any 8th grade art class.


Quotes :

* Attract mode :

"Is there no warrior mightier than I?"

"Does anyone dare challenge my imperial fleet?"

* Gameplay :

"So, a creature for my amusement. Prepare for battle!"

"So, you defeated my scouts. Well, my cruisers will destroy you."

"You are starting to annoy me, creature. My destroyers will annihilate you."

"You survived! Warships! Dispose of this annoyance at once."

"Well done. Prepare to battle my entire fleet!"


A sample of the synthesized taunt, 'Prepare for battle!', was used by musical group The Crüxshadows in their song 'Winterborn'.


- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is kind of hard since the way points are calculated is based on how many segments an alien fighter has. It is also based on what level you are on in the game. After level four, the scores remain at the level four amounts.


LEVEL 1

Alien Segment : 10 points

Incomplete Alien : 40 points

Complete Alien : 20 points

Fireball : 30 points


LEVEL 2

In addition, you get a docking bonus when you connect to your shell. This bonus is whatever you had left out of 5000 points when you started the level.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your fighter will be in the middle of the screen. Alien segments will start from the sides and head toward each other to form up. If you have ever played "Asteroids", this game works in a similar manner with the way the thrust works. If you haven't, learn how to tap versus hold down your thrust. This will give you better control over your fighter.


* You will have a maximum of 50 seconds to complete a level. Your goal, though, is to complete it in less time. The faster you take out the aliens, the higher your bonus will be when you get to the docking bonus area.


* Learn the characteristics of the alien spaceships :

a) Only complete alien spaceships can shoot fireballs. These fireballs do not track your fighter so you can either destroy them or move out of their way.

b) Incomplete alien spaceships will attempt to ram your fighter. They do track so you must destroy them before they destroy you.


* All things can 'wrap-around' the screen. This means anything exiting the screen from one of the edges will reappear at the opposite edge. Keep this in mind when you are being pursued and/or fired upon.  This also holds true when you are firing.


* After level four, the aliens will be a mix of the four levels you already went through. The action will be faster paced and you won't be able to sit still or you make yourself an easy target.


* After you complete a level (until level four), you will be given the chance to dock your fighter with a shell. This shell is an upgrade to your weapons system. You will have anywhere from 3 to 11 seconds to successfully dock :

1) Docking is real easy, just turn and thrust at the right and left shells or thrust into the top shell.

2) The shells capabilities are (from left to right) :

a) The left shell is dark blue. It fires two shots in addition to the one shot the regular fighter fires.

b) The top shell is green. It fires one shot from each side of your fighter.

c) The right shell is light blue. It fires two shots behind your fighter (in addition to your one shot in front).

3) After you successfully dock, you collect the remaining bonus.


* To avoid the headache of too many things trying to get you, try to shoot the alien segments before they form up. This will prevent them from becoming complete and launching fireballs at you.


* The incomplete alien spaceships are the most dangerous since they track your fighter.


* The best shell to have is the dark blue one since it will be easier to take out targets in front of you then behind you. To make sure you end up with the dark blue shell, pick out the other two on the first two levels.


* In the early levels, try to go for the bonus since the alien spaceships aren't worth many points. When the pace picks up in the later levels, you will accumulate more points for the aliens. Plus, you probably will never see the bonus because all of your time will be spent defending against the alien attacks.

Space Harrier [Sit-Down model] (c) 1985 Sega.


Space Harrier is a sprite-scaling, into-the-screen shoot-em-up set in the "Fantasy Zone"; a surreal, abstract world composed of bright colours and a checkerboard-styled ground. The game's enemies are as unique as its setting; featuring prehistoric animals, alien pods, giant mushrooms and, at the end of every stage, a huge, fireball-spitting Chinese dragon.


The player's on-screen counterpart carries a portable jetpack under his arm, which allows him to fly as well as run along the ground. The jetpack is equipped with a laser, allowing the player to destroy both the game's many enemies as well as a variety of obstructions, such as trees and the floating rocks on level 1.

Space Invaders (c) 1978 Taito.


Quite simply the most influential video-game of all time. A single player moves an armed 'base' left or right along the bottom of the screen and shoots the endless waves of aliens marching relentlessly down the screen towards earth.


There are 4 buildings (shields) at the bottom of the screen that the player can hide behind, but these will eventually be destroyed by either enemy missiles or by direct contact with the invaders themselves. The player's shots will also destroy the shields.


The aliens' descent quickens as they are eliminated, making them harder to hit. A flying saucer will fly across the top of the screen at regular intervals and can be shot to earn extra points.

- TRIVIA -


Released in July 1978.


The development of Space Invaders only took 3 months, but developing the programming environment alone took almost 6 months.


Space Invaders was so popular in Japan that it caused a yen shortage and more coins had to be minted. Many regular produce and goods stores in Japan removed their products and converted into Space Invaders parlors overnight, complete with giant speakers broadcasting the 'thump-thump-thump' of the marching invaders. A true classic in every sense of the word.


Invaders contains the first attract mode with a sense of humour. It would first display 'PLAY SPACE INVADERS' with the 'Y' in 'PLAY' upside-down, and an invader would come along taking the offending upside-down 'Y' and carrying it off the screen, and then coming back with the 'Y' right side up and putting it back in place. The invader would then disappear from the screen. The attract mode would also display 'INSERT CCOIN' and an invader would come along and bomb the offending extra 'C'.


There are exactly 55 invaders per screen and exactly 11 different in-game sounds.


Space Invaders was the first arcade game to work its way out of seedy arcades and into pizza parlors and ice cream shops.


The Space Invaders phenomenon stunned many conservative adults of the time who were convinced that video-games soured the minds of their youngsters. Residents of Mesquite, Texas, pushed the issue all the way to the Supreme Court in their efforts to ban the illicit machines from their Bible-belt community. A number of reported incidents of juvenile crime began to surface shortly after Invaders' release, adding to its 'controvosy'. A girl was caught stealing $5000 from her parents and gangs of youths were reported to have robbed grocery stores just so they would have money to play the game.


About 65,000 units were produced in the U.S. and a reported 350,000 world wide.


Space Invaders inspired a catchy hit song by 'Uncle Vic' called 'Space Invaders' released over the spring to summer-time period of 1980. The Pretenders also released an instrumental song called 'Space Invaders' on their debut album in 1980.


A Space Invaders unit appears in the 1980 movie 'Midnight Madness', in the 1982 movie 'Jekyll & Hyde... Together Again', in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'The Iceman', and in the 1991 movie 'Terminator 2 - Judgment Day'.


A Space Invaders unit appears in the ZZ Top music video, 'Legs'.


An upright unit of the Taito release of Space Invaders appears in the Nazareth music video 'Holiday'.

- UPDATES -


Clones "CV Version", "SV Version", and "SV Version 2" use the same color monitor and color generator board as "Space Invaders Part II", where anything not black will turn red during the explosion of the player's base once the player has been hit by enemy fire (during actual gameplay only, not during attract mode).


- SCORING -


Large Invader : 10 points.

Medium Invader : 20 points.

Small Invader : 30 points.

UFO : 50 to 300 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your base will be in the bottom left corner of the screen, below the buildings. Your goal is to blast the invaders into dust. Keep in mind that once the invaders make it to either the right or left edge of the screen, they will drop down a row and head in the opposite direction. You should plan your strategy to prevent them from making it to an edge.


* A good strategy is to start blasting out the columns on the opposite edge of movement. This is if the invaders are moving right, the start blasting out the leftmost columns first. This way, their return trip is longer and you have more time to deal with them.


* Do not attempt to hit the invaders dead center. They fire their laser bombs from dead center and your shots will collide, wasting your shot and letting them move closer to an edge.


* Speaking of shots, you can only have one shot out at a time so make it count.


* Use your buildings to your advantage. 'Peek' around buildings to get shots and blast a hole in the middle of your buildings to give you protection while you knock out columns of invaders. Keep in mind, this protection will only last about 2 columns before the invaders blow open a hole wide enough to destroy your base.


* Every other wave of invaders starts one row lower. Eventually, the waves will start one row above your buildings. Be prepared to do some fast shooting to keep them from getting any lower because once they reach your level, the game is over.


* When you are down to taking out the last invader on a wave, that invader will zip across the screen. The strange thing is that the invader travels faster going left to right than going right to left. Keep this in mind when trying to shoot it.


* The mystery saucer (or UFO) will appear at random times. If you have a good shot at it, try to hit it. Don't go out of your way, however, to go after it; it isn't worth the risk or time wasted.


* The Hidden Message Trick : To get the hidden message, you must do the following :

1) When the demo starts, you need to press the following keys at the same time on the machine :  LEFT, RIGHT, FIRE, 1 PLAYER START, 2 PLAYER START.

2) Continue to press these keys rapidly as fast as you can.

3) If you are successful, the message ('TAITO COP') will appear under the high score.


* Shot Counting Trick : To get 300 every time you hit the mystery saucer. It is named the 'Furrer Trick' named after Eric Furrer who perfected it. To do this trick, perform the following :

1) Once the new level begins, start counting the shots from your base.

2) When you have fired 22 shots, stop shooting and wait for the mystery saucer.

3) Use the 23rd shot to blast the mystery saucer.

4) After this, start counting shots again, this time count only to 14.

5) Use the 15th shot to hit the mystery saucer.

6) Continue using the 14 shot rule until the level is finished.

7) At the next wave, start with the 22 shot rule, then use the 14 shot rule to finish that wave.

8) Remember, all shots count regardless of hits or misses.


* Eric Furrer writes : Here's a variant of the Counting Trick that most people don't know and it's the exact trick I used to play that darn game for 36 hours over 20 years ago. The shot count trick works great for level 1,2,3 but you can't use 22-14-14 counts for mystery ships on the 4th wave because the invaders are too low. If you wait around for the ship after 22-14, then the invaders will be down too quick and you will surely die. Most players at this point do a 22 count and abandon the remaining 14 counts and just clear the board. This slows point accumulation.

 

My solution is simple and the shot count works in progressions as well : On the 4th wave count 22, wait, and clobber the 300. Now instead of counting 14, shoot the 29 invaders in the bottom rows and get the ship. Now the invaders are high enough to do two more 14's.


Here's the grid for rolling the machine's score in about 6 minutes by the forth wave using 29. Otherwise, you'd have to wait until the 5th wave. Seems minor, but it saves 30 seconds per roll, which could mean a 30 minute lead against a good player on a head to head speed match, a difference of about 50,000 points!

 

1st wave - 22, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14 (bonus = 3000 + 990 = 3990 first wave) 

2nd wave - 22, 14, 14, 14 (bonus = 1200 + 990 = 2190 total score now = 6180) 

3rd wave - 22, 14, 14, 14 (bonus = 1200 + 990 = 2190 total score now = 8370) 

4th wave - 22, 29, 14 (bonus = 900 + 990 = 1890 total score now = 0260 or 10260) (if you counted 22, 14, you couldn't get the 3rd 14 without severe risk of death row) 

5th wave - 22, 29, 14 (same as 4th wave)

6th wave - 22, 14 

7th wave - 22 14 

8th wave - 22 

9th wave - 22

 

Then back to the first wave!!

Space Invaders (c) 198? Logitec Co., Ltd.


A bootleg version of the original.


- TECHNICAL -


This bootleg of "Space Invaders" has a color monitor. While most of the screen remains B&W, the green is actually generated by the PCB (Printed Circuit Board) and although it looks very much like an overlay it's not. Back then this pirated PCB, because of it's design and minimal memory room on the PCB, (remember we are talking old technology), the game was very complex for it's time. It used an old 8080 processor which unlike the Z80 processor, it had its limitations. When this game was first designed it was originally going to be released as a B&W game and not color. The green is done by taking a segment out of the video processing area of the PCB and pulling it down with a bipolar prom to generate the affect. There are actually 2 video lines on this pcb - 1 for B&W and the other for sync and color.

Space Invaders DX (c) 1994 Taito.


A modern and fitting tribute to Taito's 1978 seminal shoot-em-up, "Space Invaders". 


There are now 3 different game modes to choose from. These include a faithful recreation of the legendary original - available in both upright and cocktail versions - and replete with a simulation of the infamous "coloured plastic overlay" that was used to add the impression of full colour graphics to the original game.


The 2 remaining game modes are 'Versus', with simultaneous split-screen 2-player action, and "Parody", which features characters and graphics from other well-known Taito games, such as "The New Zealand Story", "Bubble Bobble" and "Liquid Kids". Despite the graphical changes, the Parody version plays identically to the original game, and all modes retain the original, legendary sound effects.

Space Invaders Deluxe (c) 1979 Midway.


Space Invaders Deluxe is a simple 2-D shooter. You control your laser base against an endless stream of alien invaders. Once you clear out one wave of invaders, another is just waiting to take your base out. Of course, your objective is simple, eliminate the invaders before they eliminate you.

- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1979.


This game is also known as "Space Invaders Part II" (Taito). Space Invaders Deluxe still says "Space Invaders Part II" on the title-screen because Midway was only allowed to make minor modifications of the Taito code. All other references to the game (promotional material, manual, service bulletins, labels on the motherboard, serial number tags inside the cabinet, monitor glass, etc.) say 'Space Invaders Deluxe'.


This game was also manufactured by Nichibutsu under the name of "Moon Base".


A Space Invaders Deluxe unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High'.


- UPDATES -


* Space Invaders Deluxe uses a color overlay. "Space Invaders Part II" (Taito) uses a color monitor and a simple color generator board that turns anything that is not black to red when the player's ship explodes during gameplay (but not during attract mode).

* Changes in game-play include invaders that march forward, invaders that split to form 2 when shot, another bonus ship that flies by above the invaders, intermissions between racks and the famous 'rainbow bonus'.


- SCORING -


Large Invader : 10 points

Medium Invader : 20 points

Small Invader : 30 points

UFO : 50 to 300 points

Flashing UFO : 200 points

'Rainbow' Bonus : 500 or 1000 points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your base will be in the bottom left corner of the screen, below the buildings. Your goal is to blast the invaders into dust. Keep in mind that once the invaders make it to either the right or left edge of the screen, they will drop down a row and head in the opposite direction. You should plan your strategy to prevent them from making it to an edge.


* A good strategy is to start blasting out the columns on the opposite edge of movement. If the invaders are moving right, the start blasting out the leftmost columns first. This way, their return trip is longer and you have more time to deal with them.


* Do not attempt to hit the invaders dead center. They fire their laser bombs from dead center and your shots will collide, wasting your shot and letting them move closer to an edge.


* Speaking of shots, you can only have one shot out at a time so make it count.


* Use your buildings to your advantage. 'Peek' around buildings to get shots and blast a hole in the middle of your buildings to give you protection while you knock out columns of invaders. Keep in mind, this protection will only last about 2 columns before the invaders blow open a hole wide enough to destroy your base.


* Every other wave of invaders starts one row lower. Eventually, the waves will start one row above your buildings. Be prepared to do some fast shooting to keep them from getting any lower because once they reach your level, the game is over.


* When you are down to taking out the last invader on a wave, that invader will zip across the screen. The strange thing is that the invader travels faster going left to right then going right to left.  Keep this in mind when trying to shoot it.


* The mystery saucer (or UFO) will appear at random times. If you have a good shot at it, try to hit it. Don't go out of your way, however, to go after it; it isn't worth the risk or time wasted.


* When you get a wave that has spaces in-between the invaders (4th wave in "Space Invaders Part II"; 2nd wave in "Space Invaders Deluxe"), be prepared for heavier fighting. These gaps are left to accommodate the 'new' invaders that will appear. These new invaders appear when you hit one of the regular invaders and it splits.


* The blinking saucer can only be hit when it is solid. Time your shot right and you may be able to hit it.


* Another thing is if you are getting too successful at blasting the invaders, a Mystery Ship will show up and start to deposit more invaders for you to take out.


* The Hidden Message Trick. To get the hidden message, you must do the following :

1) When the demo starts, you need to press the following keys at the same time on the machine :  LEFT, RIGHT, FIRE, 1 PLAYER START, 2 PLAYER START.

2) Continue to press these keys rapidly as fast as you can.

3) If you are successful, the message ('TAITO CORP.') will appear below the high score. The 'spelling error' on "Space Invaders" is corrected.


* Shot Counting Trick : To get 300 every time you hit the mystery saucer. It is named the 'Furrer Trick' named after Eric Furrer who perfected it. To do this trick, perform the following :

1) Once the new level begins, start counting the shots from your base.

2) When you have fired 22 shots, stop shooting and wait for the mystery saucer.

3) Use the 23rd shot to blast the mystery saucer.

4) After this, start counting shots again, this time count only to 14.

5) Use the 15th shot to hit the mystery saucer.

6) Continue using the 14 shot rule until the level is finished.

7) At the next wave, start with the 22 shot rule, then use the 14 shot rule to finish that wave.

8) Remember, all shots count regardless of hits or misses.


* Eric Furrer writes : The 'Shot Counting' trick from "Space Invaders" works in Space Invaders Deluxe but the flashing mystery ship can throw you off. You can count 22 like in Space Invaders, but you must count 14 or 29 from the 300 to the next 300, even if you hit the flashing mystery ship. Also, in Space Invaders Part II, the mystery ship drops invaders, so he's harder to target. In Space Invaders Deluxe, I just do the first 22, and concentrate on leaving the left lower invader as the last invader to kill for the 1,000 point fireworks bonus.


* Rainbow Trick : If the final aliens you kill are in the bottom 2 rows, you get a fireworks display and 500 bonus points. If it happens to be the bottom, left-most alien, you get fireworks and a 1,000 point bonus.


* Extra Life : The machine will award you a bonus life during the intermission if you were able to wipe out the previous screen in 55 shots or less. Of course, this is very difficult to do. However, you can take advantage of the famous 8-bit rollover bug by firing OVER 255 shots, thereby rolling over the shot counter! Just make sure you can wipe out the remaining invaders in under 55 shots after you roll the counter over..


* Preset Mode : Space Invaders Deluxe provided a way the operator could enter his/her name each time the machine was turned on.

1) Turn preset mode ON in the DIP switch.

2) Insert one credit.

3) Depress one player select button 'Preset Mode' will be displayed on screen.

4) Depress one player select button again to increase score until previous high-score is beaten. Note : If you press the two player select button you can skip the starting level as well.

5) Depress Fire button to start game. After all bases have been destroyed the alphabet will be displayed on screen. A new name may now be entered.

6) Turn preset mode OFF in the DIP switch to re-establish game mode.

Space Invaders II (c) 03/1980 Midway.


Space Invaders II allowed for 2-Player simultaneous competitive play (although both players could work together). Besides shooting the invaders, one of the goals was to destroy your opponent (either CPU or another player) and gain his ships!

- TRIVIA -


This game was a Midway in-house project, done by Joel Kreger. His name can be found in one of the game ROMs using a hex editor. This game runs on modified SI Deluxe hardware, with two sound boards; one for each player. Player 2's sound was a bit higher in pitch than player 1. The sounds of player 2 are also a bit different, with the enemy explosion and ship destroyed sounds being different than player 1. The overlay contained many colors, running from red (player 1) to yellow (player 2), with various shades of blue and green in between.


The game used a Z80A processor. Replacing the CPU with a regular Z80 causes the game to play the 'THUMP THUMP' sound during the attract mode.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Occasionally, a mystery ship will fly by, dropping more invaders!! When 2 players are playing, TWO different mystery ships fly by. The points for shooting them range from 50 pts to 525 pts (!!!).


When playing with 2 players, player-2 has lost all of his ships, and he still has invaders left on his side, they will move back and forth when they 'land' endlessly, until player 1 destroys them.


If 2 players are playing, player-2 has lost all of his ships, and player-1 clears player-2's board with ships left, player-2 will gain one of player 1's ships to return to the game!!

Space Wars (c) 1977 Cinematronics.


Space Wars is a battle between 2 opposing space ships in a hostile spacefield.

Main CPU : CCPU (@ 5 Mhz)


Players : 2

=> LEFT, RIGHT, THRUST, FIRE, HYPERSPACE


- TRIVIA -


Released in October 1977.


Space Wars was the first vector game, and introduced the concept of 'fuel for money', in which the player could insert more coins and buy more fuel during the current game in play.


Rosenthal began working on Space Wars in 1973. He realized he had a commercially viable product on his hands in December of 1976 when he put the game in a friend's arcade before leaving on a trip to Boston. When he returned, he found that the game had made $500 in 6 days and he began looking for a company to license his game. He hit the streets carrying a demonstration unit (along with a "Lunar Lander" game he'd created) but was rejected by most companies until he struck a deal with Cinematronics, who had been around since 1975 but had produced only 3 games, none of them hits. Space Wars was the hit of the 1977 AMOA show and went on to sell at least 10,000 units (some sources put the figure at 3 times that).


Atari reportedly offered Cinematronics $5 million to license the game but the offer was refused (though Cinematronics would launch an unsuccessful lawsuit against Atari for patent violation after the release of "Asteroids").


A Space Wars unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Tron'.

- SCORING -


Once a ship is destroyed : 1 point


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Temporary invincibility : Either ship will become invincible after being hit as long as their pieces are still floating in space. This can be used as an advantage by skimming the edge of the middle star in the middle to knock off a piece of the ship. Then, fly into your opponent while invincible.

It's a very rare prototype, there are only 2 or 3 in existence. The concept was just a little too hard for a mass market. It would make a great game, but Atari never decided to do anything with it. Its earnings in an arcade test just weren't high enough to justify production.

This game is known outside Japan as "Kung-Fu Master".


First scrolling beat-em-up, this game is based on the movie 'Wheels on Meals', starring Jackie Chan (as Thomas) and Sammo Hung (who also directed). This movie is called 'Spartan X' in Japan.


- UPDATES -


Differences between Spartan X and Kung-Fu Master :

* During the demo screen the word Kung-Fu (in 'A KUNG-FU MASTER, THOMAS....') is spelled 'KANFU' in Spartan X.

* Spartan X has an additional copyright notice that is not in Kung-Fu Master : '(C)1984 Paragon Films Ltd., Towa Promotion'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Slow Motion Mode : Turn 'slow motion mode' ON in dipswitch. In game, press Start 2 to slow game speed.


* Stop Mode : Turn 'Freeze' ON in dipswitch. In game, press Start 2 to stop and Start 1 to restart.


* Level Seclection Mode : Turn 'Level seclection mode' ON in dipswitch. In game, press Start 1 to select and Start 2 to restart.


* Hint : Time your punches properly. They give you double score compared with the kicks, but they're much more risky, as you can fall short with your punch and get grabbed.


* Defeating the Bosses :

1) FIRST BOSS : Easy. Wait to his first pole swing from a safe distance and then quickly get close (stuck) to him. From now on, his attacks won't hit you. Walk forward (making him walk back) until you reach the staircases and then start punching him in the belly.

2) SECOND BOSS : First, clean your back of henchmen. Then, wait for the boomerang dude to throw his first boomerang , avoid it and this is the time! You have to hit him like hell while he's waiting to recover his boomerang. Punches hurt double. If you're quick enough punching, he won't recover his first boomerang.

3) THIRD BOSS : Just make a jumping moving kick, hit him in the chest, and as soon you touch the floor (falling down from the jumping kick) start punching fast as hell! With any luck he won't touch you anyway. Be sure to have spare energy to perform this movement just in case he has time to give you a kick (1/4 of the bar would be enough).

4) FOURTH BOSS : Watch out, this one is tricky. First, take him to the limits where he can walk (He suddenly stops as he can't get closer to you). Then come closer to him and duck, avoiding his projectiles. Then, a copy of him will appear at your back. Stand up and start walking (avoiding projectiles again) just as you did with the first boss. As soon as you arrive at the stairs, duck and start punching. He will appear and disappear, but JUST in front of you. Six punches and he's history.

5) FIFTH BOSS : Mainly keep him defending himself with high kicks (tapping very fast!) and then suddenly change to low kicks. Start with a jumping moving kick in the chest (just like the third boss) and then start the high/low kicks patterns.

Spectar (c) 1980 Exidy.


Spectar, released by Exidy in 1980, is the follow-up of "Targ". Gameplay is apparently unchanged, you control a vehicle called Whummel into a 9x9 grid maze, chasing down, and being chased by, the alien invaders. Targs have evolved into the more dangerous Rammers, and Spectars appears more often, shooting at player's ship.


You use a 4-Way joystick to guide your vehicle in the maze, and a pushbutton to shoot at enemies. Up to 2 players can alternate in gameplay.


The most noticeable difference from his predecessors is that to complete a level you can now collect all the gems in the maze, in a "Pacman"-like game or destroy all of the Rammers (like in "Targ"). Rammers and Spectars continue to appear from flashing pods, so you cannot rest and plan your course easily, or you will be overwhelmed by the alien force.


Graphic is highly improved compared to his predecessor : The maze now has barricades that must be avoided or can be used as a shielding against the enemies, and has ten environement settings, changing from the 'square-block town' of Targ to a city, a forest, a lunar landscape and many more. The enemies too are smarter and faster, and the fact that they go on spawning from the pods makes the game a even more frenzy challenge.

Speed Freak (c) 1979 Vectorbeam.


In Speed Freak you drove an extremely fast car along a lonesome road. The idea was simply to drive as fast as you can without crashing. The game was time based, you could crash as much as you wanted, but points were scored for driving as fast and as far as you could without crashing. Your view of the action was from behind the hood of the car, but slightly above what an actual driver would see, kind of like you were sitting on the roof instead of inside the car. Obstacles were mainly oncoming cars (which was always the same one), and police roadblocks. The off-road scenery was limited to stick figure cows, hitchhikers, and the occasional cactus.

Released in March 1979.


Speed Freak was Larry's first game for Vectorbeam. Only 700 units were produced. The machine was available only as an upright dedicated cabinet. The cabinet was white with sticker sideart on each side that displayed the game name, and a picture of a red car. The control panel is simply black with a red and yellow stripe around it. The monitor bezel had no decoration at all, and the marquee was made of metal, and was not illuminated in any way. The game used a 19'' monochrome vector monitor.


A Speed Freak unit appears in the 1980 movie 'Midnight Madness'.

Spelunker (c) 1986 Broderbund.


In Spelunker - which means 'cave-diver' - a caver has to work his way down through a number of multi-directionally scrolling caves - each one deeper underground than the last - in his bid to find the mythical 'World of Wonders'. To do this, the spelunker must find the exit to each cave, so he can move on to the next and get closer to his goal.


Spelunker is a platform game, and each tricky cave is filled with enemies - such as bats and ogres - and traps. Ladders, ropes, lifts and the obligatory minecarts must be used to reach other platforms and sections of the cave.


To aid him in his difficult quest, the Spelunker carries a gun and can shoot short-range fireballs at his enemies to stun or kill them. Numerous bonus items can be collected, such as bombs to destroy any rocks block his route, keys to open locked doors and potions to boost the caver's ever-decreasing energy meter. Treasure chests also litter each cave, and can be opened for bonus treasure items.

This game is known in Japan as "Miracle Adventure".


Spinmaster is Data East's first game developed and released for the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.


This game seems heavily inspired by Data East's classic game "Caveman Ninja" (the artwork style, some character's animations, as well as the weapon's power up styles are a little too similar!).


The Mad Doctor also appeared as the final boss in Data East's "Tumble Pop".


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtracl album for this game (Miracle Adventure. Tatakae Genshijin 3 - PCCB-00146) on 18/02/1994.

- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1988. The game was banned in most arcades in the US due to its violent nature as well as some questionable bosses such as the chapel boss (The inverted cross). Splatterhouse was the first game to get a parental advisory disclaimer.


Rick makes a cameo appearance in "Point Blank 3".


Splatterhouse's developers seem to have been inspired by many known and a few lesser known horror flicks such as...

* Friday the 13th movies : The third boss wears a bag for a mask just like Jason Voorhees did on the first three movies and Rick's mask resembles the well-know hockey mask that Jason wears in the later movies of the series until the Jason X movie in which he gets a totally different new look.

* Evil Dead movies : Many concepts were borrowed from these particular movies such as : House deep within the woods where a famed scientist unleashes some very evil demonic power; The fight between Rick and his evil twins; The evil severed hands that even taunt him; The possessed room with flying furniture; The necromancer's zombies that just won't die, Rick's quest to rescue Jennifer, only to find her possessed and turned into a cackling demon hungry for his blood!

* The Exorcist : When fighting against demon Jennifer, she recovers her sanity for a few brief moments and begs for your help just before turning into a demon once again, something quite similar is seen in this horror classic.

* H-man : The sludge monsters seen in the sewer levels seem somewhat similar to the liquid people seen in this old japanese horror flick.

* Poltergeist : The possessed room may also have been inspired by this movie.

* Parasite : The leeches seen at the end of the first stage as well as in many other later levels are cleary based on the creatures seen in this pseudo 3-D movie.

* Rejuvenator : The big headed monsters whose heads fly off and attack before dying are very reminiscent of the gruesome brain-eating monster seen in this film.

* Re-Animator : Dr. West is largely believed to be Herbert West who was featured prominently in H.P. Lovecraft's story Herbert West : Reanimator, who was subsequently featured in the "Re-Animator" film series.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Winning Run : G.S.M. Namco 2 - D24B1003) on 21/07/1989.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Slide Kick : Rick's most powerful attack is also the trickiest move to do in the game! Do a big jump (hold the jump button) while walking either left or right, then as Rick comes down from the jump hold diagonally down-left or down-right and press the attack button JUST BEFORE Rick's feet touch the ground. Use this move to take out many enemies at once and to quickly reach a level's exit but be sure not to slide right into a trap such as a pit, an acid puddle, etc! 


* Reaching The Exit Is More Important Than Fighting! : When you are close enough to the end of a level, Rick will automatically walk towards the exit and he becomes completely invulnerable to any incoming enemy attack!


* Save Your Ammo! : You can only use your weapons while standing or jumping. This means you are free to low kick or slide kick your enemies in order to save your weapons for tougher enemies in a particular level. Also each time you pick another weapon, Rick will drop the previous weapon slightly ahead of him allowing you to pick it up again. This is particularly useful against the third stage's boss since you'll be able to easily blow him away with two shotguns!

Released in March 1987. The game was not successful for Bally Midway, in fact Spy Hunter II is widely considered by gamers as one of the worst sequels ever made. The game's use of a 3-D perspective from behind and above the car in place of an overhead view used in the original was an unpopular one. Though it created more realism, many fans prefered the original and as a result it never went into large scale production.


Peter Gunn theme music plays throughout the game.

Spy Hunter (c) 1983 Bally Midway.


Spy Hunter is an action/driving game. It places the player as the driver of a G-6155 CIA Prototype Interceptor sports car. The object of the game is to travel the freeways and waterways, hunting down and destroying as many enemy vehicles as possible, all the while not harming civilian vehicles. The view is top-down and the screen scrolls vertically underneath the player's car.


The game begins with the player driving the G-6155. Soon, the player starts to encounter enemy vehicles which try to force the player's car off the road and crash. Each enemy vehicle has its own special feature, such as tire slashers or bulletproof armor.


Points are scored for driving on the road and for destroying enemy vehicles. There is a lead-in time when the player has an endless supply of cars. After this time expires, the player will lose a life each time the car crashes. Extra cars can be earned with high scores. The first extra car is earned at a default value of 30,000 points, but this value can vary depending on settings.


The player must be careful to avoid harming civilian vehicles on the road. There are three types:  blue automobiles, pink automobiles, and motorcycles. Hurting these vehicles causes scoring to stop briefly, during which time the player-s score reads 'NO POINTS'.


Initially, the only weapon the player's car has available is a dual front-mounted machine gun which has an endless supply of ammunition. Early on, these guns and the player's driving skill are his only weapons against the enemy cars. The player can also attempt to force or ram the enemy cars off the road.  Eventually the player encounters an ally, the weapons van. After the player drives past the weapons van parked on the side of the road, the van accelerates past the player's car and positions itself in front of it and drops a ramp. The player can then drive up the ramp to enter the back of the van. The van then pulls to the side of the road and deploys the spy car equipped with a new weapon. A symbol atop the weapons van indicates which type of special weapon it carries. The player is not obligated to use the weapons supplied by the van.  Also, if uninterested, the player can simply ignore the van and drive past it.


There are three special weapons in all and they can all be equipped simultaneously. The special weapons consist of an oil slick, a smoke screen and missiles. Each special weapon has a limited number of uses. The smoke screen and missiles can each be used three times. The special weapons are activated via dedicated buttons on the steering wheel. Once the weapons ammo is depleted or before, the car can be refitted with a new supply from the weapons van.


There are six enemies in all, each with their own special characteristic :

* 'Switchblade' or 'Never To Be Trusted' cars have tire slashers. Knives pop out of this car's tires and can force the player's car to crash if they touch his tires.

* 'The Road Lord' or 'Bulletproof Bully' cars have bulletproof armor plating; machine guns are ineffective against these cars.

* 'The Enforcer' or 'Double Barrel Action' is a limousine with a shotgun toting thug who shoots at the player's car.

* 'The Mad Bomber' or 'Master Of The Sky' is a helicopter which drops bombs. This enemy can only be destroyed with missiles.

* 'Barrel Dumper' is a boat which drops lethal explosives into the water.

* 'Doctor Torpedo' is a boat which shoots torpedoes at the player's ship.


Occasionally a message appears on screen that says 'Bridge out - Detour on Left'. Then the player must drive his car into a boat house located alongside the road, otherwise he will crash into the water and lose a life. After driving through this house, the player-s car is turned into a speedboat on a river, with enemy boats which try to destroy the player. In this area, if the player uses the oil slick, the boat instead issues a line of fire which destroys any ship directly behind the player. In this area, occasionally the river splits; the left side continues the river, the right side causes the player to drive through another house where the boat is changed back into the car.


Later in the game the player gets a warning that there are 'Icy Roads Ahead', then the player enters an area that has white road which is very slick.  The icy roads section eventually ends and goes back to normal roads. Icy roads occur again on and off during the rest of the game.

- TRIVIA -


Released in December 1983.


Originally the James Bond theme was planned as the background music for the game. The inability to obtain the rights to use the music, however, forced Midway to change the theme on shipping models. In the end, the Peter Gunn theme music was a large part of the game's appeal.


A boat driving sequence and a helicopter sequence was also planned. Shortage of memory, however, did not allow for this feature. The game has no end and at no time does the player ever leave the car but it was RUMORED to have a graveyard sequence, an actual end and a sequence where the player exited the car for on-foot action.


The car was based on one of the designer's own Nissan 280z. The name of the car, the G-6155, is a clever tribute to designer George Gomez - the numbers stand for his birth date.


From George Gomez : 'My original design for both upright and sit-down were identical. And they were produced that way if only because of the economies of manufacturing. Which means : why make different parts, since it will cost less to make more of one design. "Spy Hunter 2" which I had nothing to do with was different. On my game both left and right grips should each have a trigger and a thumb button, in addition to the center button (call weapons van). The shifter was a 2 position device, low and high. Of course there was the gas pedal and a series of dashboard weapons lights for machine guns, missiles, oil slick and smoke. After the first few thousand games the grips were retooled in plastic and they went on to be used in hundreds of different games. They were licensed to Happ controls in the late 80's and they have been on almost every manufacturer's games at one point or another. The original sand cast aluminum grips(painted black) were actually molded directly from patterns that I carved and they had softer contours and were more comfortable but they were also very expensive. So to cost reduce them the company took the grips and retooled them to be injection molded plastic. However the patterns for the plastic grips were made off the engineering drawings and the drawings of that era were not as representative of the actual parts I carved, since they were made after my patterns instead of before. I have the original wood patterns along with some other stuff from development of the game in a box somewhere.'.


Spy Hunter was parodied in a sketch in the television show Robot Chicken.


In 2008, a Pontiac Commercial featured an homage to Spy Hunter by showing some gameplay which had the player's car turn into a real Pontiac

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Here's A Great Cheat That Does Several Things At Once :

1) You need to have a supply truck available, and a be at a bridge-out level. When the detour appears, don't take it - instead, call up your truck.

2) Wait until the road has straightened out into the bridge and drive into the truck. When the truck pulls over and lets you out, stay on the side of the road, and SLOWLY drive up until you reach the gap in the bridge.

3) Drive on until you car is about half-way over the edge, and wait until the Enforcer comes along. He will try and get you, but he'll be unable to drive far enough to do so. At this point, I would get a friend to mind the game, while I went for a break. When I returned, I just drove across the bridge, flying mysteriously across the bridge out, until I reached the other side.

4) You will notice several differences to the game after this happens. The Enforcer no longer appears, the game gets no harder, and Dr. Torpedo no longer appears on water sections!

Star Castle (c) 1980 Cinematronics.


Star Castle is a 1- or 2-player outer space action game designed with features geared for maximum player appeal : A progressively difficult competitive level and a clearly defined enemy which must be both attacked and avoided at various points in the course of play.


The center of the playfield is occupied by the Star Castle which is programmed to constantly home in on the players' ships. Surrounding the Star Castle are three concentric energy rings of twelve segments each, which serve as both a protective perimeter for the Star Castle and a source of points for the player. Contained within the energy rings are three protective mines which seek out the players' ships and destroy them upon collision. The movements of the mines are programmed to simulate the actions of heat-seeking missiles.


The object of the games of Star Castle is to score the maximum number of points possible. This is accomplished by the combination of three elements :

a) Exploding the ring segments.

b) Exploding the Star Castle.

c) Avoiding the Star Castle's mines. A player's turn is over when his ship has been destroyed. The number of ships per game is set by the operator.


For maximum scoring, a player will want to shoot out sections of the energy rings in order to give him a shot at the Star Castle in the center of the screen. As play progresses, there are 2 facts a player must keep in mind :

1) Exploding all segments in a given ring will cause the entire ring to reappear - thereby eliminating a potential shot at the Star Castle in the center.

2) Exploding the rings in a manner that gives you a shot at the Star Castle will also give the Star Castle a shot at you. The Star Castle is programmed so that its nose always seeks out the player's ship. If there is an open shot at the player, it will take it.


When the Star Castle is hit by a player's missile, it will first implode and then explode with all remaining ring segments. After a one-second delay, the Star Castle will reappear with all three ring segments. If the Star Castle shoots the player, his turn is over.


As play begins, the Star Castle will appear in the center of the screen surrounded by its 3 energy rings. The player's ship appears about halfway up on the right hand edge. By using the control buttons to move forward, right or left, the player maneuvers about the screen using the firing button to launch missiles.


Points are scored by destroying the energy ring segments or the Star Castle itself. Exploding the Star Castle gives an extra ship as well as points. No points are given for the mines that attack the player.


The player's ship can be destroyed in 2 ways : By collision with the mines or by a hit from the Star Castle's torpedo. The mines are launched from the rings and attack the player for approximately ten seconds or until shot. The Star Castle's torpedoes are launched only when there is a clear shot at the player through all 3 rings. At this time the player also has his shot at the Star Castle. Both the Star Castle and the mines get smarter and faster as the game progresses.


The game of STAR CASTLE is not based on time units. The battle rages on until all the players' ships are destroyed. The length of the game depends solely on the skill of the player. It's the age-old challenge of man versus machine.

Star Castle machines came in a white upright cabinet with a black front section. The side-art covered the top half of the machine, and showed a scene of two blue spaceships on a red background, along with the title. The marquee was black and included the scoring information, while the control panel and monitor bezel were decorated with geometric shapes that were supposed to represent the interior (or possible exterior), of a spacecraft. The control panel has no joystick. Play is instead controlled with four buttons, fire, thrust, rotate left, and rotate right (just like "Asteroids"). Although some bootleg units may have joysticks. This game uses a black and white vector open frame monitor, but it has several color overlays installed to make the rings different colors.

- TRIVIA -


Released in September 1980.


This was one of the first games to use an experimental artificial intelligence to harras the game player's ship. The star constellation in the background was actually the outline of a centerfold from a 1980 issue of OUI magazine. When management found out after shipping about 5,000 units, they flipped out and almost stopped production. They eventually came to their senses and nothing was changed.


About 14,000 units were produced.


The original inspiration for the game reportedly came from an early version of Larry Rosenthal's never-released "Oops!" in which the player controlled a sperm trying to fertilize an egg in the center of the screen. Later, Dan Sunday changed the game so that the player rotated in the middle of the screen, protected by rotating blocks, and shot snowflake-shaped objects that were flying towards him. Eventually, the player would be overwhelmed by the objects and the game would be over. Tim Skelly later changed the game around to its final form by anchoring the enemy in the middle of the screen, and having the player fly around and destroy the shield to get to the enemy.


Licensed to Mottoeis for Spanish manufacture and distribution.


A bootleg of this game is known as "Stellar Castle".


A Star Castle unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1982 movie 'Rocky III', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1986 movie 'Maximum Overdrive' and in the 1996 movie 'High School High'.


A Star Castle cabinet can be seen in the background of the 1984 movie Ghostbusters (in the scene when they're eating and suddenly they get a call to their first case at the Sedgewick Hotel).


A Star Castle unit appears (multiple times) in a 'Columbo' tv movie episode : (Murder, Smoke and Shadows) directed by James Frawley (in the same episode you can see beside this cabinet a "Joust" unit).


The Atari 2600 game "Yar's Revenge" originated from a rough version of Star Castle for that system which never made it to production.


- SCORING -


Outer Ring : 10 points

Middle Ring : 20 points

Inner Ring : 30 points


There are a total of 720 points possible for each set of three rings.


When you destroy the laser cannon, you get the points for rings remaining plus points for destroying the cannon plus an extra man as a bonus for destroying the cannon.


Sparks are worth no points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


A) Get used to using the edges of the screen. it will come in handy once you start using the patterns set forth below, and it's always a good habit in ASTEROIDS-type games.


B) After a certain point in the game, you must learn never to stay in one place for more than a second.


C) It's a shame that the game speeds up with time instead of with each cannon destroyed otherwise, you could play indefinitely simply by destroying the first castle's outer ring over and over. As it is, though, you must take as little time as possible to destroy each castle, ensuring a steady supply of bonus ships.


D) Except for shifting the slow ring to the middle later in the game (see Strategy I)) try not to let a castle grow new rings, it wastes time.


E) Similarly, shoot an approaching bomb only if it is alone and you do not wont to move. Otherwise, you are wasting your time, gaining no points, and taking the risk of missing.


F) When you have only the inner ring between you and the cannon and you are close enough, a triple burst will destroy it before it has a chance to retaliate.


G) When the game begins to speed up, try this simple pattern : go to the center of the left or right edge and face the edge of the screen. Your shots will cross behind and hit the other side of the castle.


As soon as the bombs get too close for comfort, simply thrust about an inch forward and you will be on the other side of the screen, still firing at the castle. As the bombs cross the screen towards you, turn around and repeat the procedure.


H) Once the game is at maximum speed, you will need a more sophisticated technique. Here it is : Spend all your time in 2 opposite corners. You should dart back and forth behind the screen developing a turn-thrust-shoot rhythm and synchronizing it with the outer ring so that you are always shooting at the same spot. Once you perfect this method, the cannon and bombs will never be fast enough to do more than almost destroy you.


I) For best effect, the corner pattern should be followed with the slow ring in the middle. You can shift it to this position by quickly destroying the outer wall twice before beginning your attack in earnest.

Star Fire [Upright model] (c) 1978 Exidy.


Exidy STARFIRE is a single player game which simulates combat between space-going fighters. The player can control the speed and direction of his fighter and attack enemy fighters with his lasers; the enemy fighters shoot fireballs at the player. The object of play is to accumulate points by destroying enemy fighters. A player can buy extra playtime during play and continue the game he is playing, as long as he has any time left; he earns bonus playtime each time he exceeds a bonus score. The game keeps track of 20 high scores - one score for each number of coins accumulated. The initials of high scoring players are displayed during the game's attract mode.


Play Mode - The screen shows a crosshair gun sight at the center of a background of stars; enemy ships move across this background. The background moves as the player works the controls, but the crosshairs always stay at the center of the screen.


The bottom of the screen has several indicators and a message panel.  A thrust indicator shows the player's speed and forward-reverse direction, and a long range scan indicator shows the presence and direction of any enemy ships off the main screen. Other indicators show the player's current score and fuel level. The message panel tells whether the player has hit an enemy ship or been hit himself, whether his laser is ready to fire, etc.


Enemy fighters move in all directions on the screen, getting larger or smaller as they move toward or away from the player. Bonus Exidy pirate ships move from left to right across the screen, and always stay the same size. The fighters and pirate ships come in three colors: blue, green, and gold (actually orange). Blue fighters are worth 10 points, green fighters 20 points, and gold fighters 40 points; all bonus Exidy pirate ships are worth 50 points.


When a target (an enemy fighter or bonus Exidy pirate ship) comes near the crosshairs, two gauge scales appear - one from the right side and one from the bottom of the screen.  At the same time, a warning beep sounds. If the player maneuvers the target into the crosshairs, it is locked-on - the enemy is frozen in the crosshairs for several seconds, and the player can easily destroy it with his laser. When the player locks onto the enemy, a second warning beep sounds, a 'LOCKED!' message appears on the message panel, and the target flashes in the crosshairs.


Press the laser fire button, and four simulated laser beams converge on the center crosshairs from the corners of the screen. If the lasers hit a target, it explodes. Enemy fighters can shoot fireballs at the player; if a fireball hits, the screen flashes and the player is penalized by being reset to blue targets.


STARFIRE produces a wide variety of sound effects. An ENGINE RUMBLE sounds throughout the play, and an EXPLOSION sounds whenever an enemy explodes or the player is hit by enemy fire. There is a LASER sound whenever the player pushes the laser fire button, and a HISS whenever an enemy fighter fires at the player.


There are four different kinds of WARNING BEEP. These warn the player when he is almost locked onto a target, when he is actually locked on, when a target is just off the edge of the screen, and when the laser overheats.


These sounds are heard only during the play mode. There is only one operator adjustment for the sound effects - the volume control.


STARFIRE has 3 player controls: a steering yoke, a thrust control, and a laser fire button. To steer right or left across the screen, turn the steering yoke like an automobile steering wheel; to move down or up, move the yoke in or out. Slide the thrust control T-handle up or down to move forward or back. The laser fire button is on the left handgrip of the steering yoke.


Awards and Bonuses - The operator can set the bonus score to 300, 500, or 700 points, or can turn off the bonus feature.  If the bonus has been set, a player has one chance of a bonus for each 300 fuel units he buys. If he tops the bonus score during any 300 unit period, the game awards him a bonus of 150 fuel units. This bonus fuel is added after the fuel indicator reaches zero. The player can only get one bonus for each 300 fuel units he buys.


The coin accumulator keeps track of the coins a player has spent. STARFIRE maintains twenty high scores : one for players who have only inserted one coin, a second for two-coin players, and so on. Players who spend more than twenty coins are lumped together in the twenty-coin score.


When a player finishes playing, STARFIRE counts the coins he has spent and compares his point score to the appropriate high score. If he has topped that score, the game asks him for his initials (one, two, or three letters); as long as his high score stands, his initials will be on the attract mode score table. If switch 7 of the DIP switch is ON, the score table will stay on screen as long as the laser fire button is pressed.


Every third coin a player spends buys double playtime. That is, STARFIRE awards four coins worth of playtime for each three coins spent.

Released in December 1978, this is the first arcade coin-operated video game to maintain a high score table by accepting and displaying the names of winning players.


Also released as "Star Fire [Cockpit model]" (was the first environmental game, featuring a viewer window).


A 'Star Fire II' update was intended to go into the last run of Star Fire units, it features a more refined high score display and easier high score input.


Star Fire [Upright model] appears in the 1980 movie 'Midnight Madness'.

Star Force (c) 1984 Tehkan.


A single player, vertically scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player pilots a spaceship over series series of islands - drifting in outer-space space - shooting enemy spacecraft and ground-based targets. Special symbols appear at regular intervals and can be shot or collected for bonuses and power-ups. Each level has an end-of-level boss that must be defeated before the player can progress to the next level, while the levels themselves are designated by letters of the Greek alphabet.

This game is known in US as "Megaforce".


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* A Trick : You can determine which direction the end of level boss will move before it even appears by looking at your score. If the hundreds digit is odd, the boss will move to the left. If it is even, it'll move right (the tens and units digits are always zero).


* One Million Points Bonus : On the violet continent, if you see a coelacanth fossil on the left side, go to the -right- side and shoot. Cleopatra appears - shoot her and you'll get a million-point bonus. The coelacanth may only appear on the third violet continent.


* 80,000 Points Bonus : At some points in the game you will see two columns of green arrows down the center of the screen. Concentrate on either the left or right column of these arrows, and try to shoot 16 in a row. You will be awarded an 80,000 bonus for doing this. The first time these appear, it is possible to get two such bonuses in a row (if there are not many enemies around!), and sometimes more if the level ends before the column has finished appearing. Later on there is a short column of only 16, so only one bonus is possible here.


* 50,000 Point Bonus : You've seen a big enemy that combines into parts. When you hear the tune it is about to appear, STOP SHOOTING (You don't actually have to stop shooting altogether, but if you hit part of the enemy before the center part flashes white the bonus will not work). Position your ship so that you are just underneath the center part of the enemy and wait for it to flash white. Once this has happened, shoot the center part several times : the enemy will be destroyed and you will be awarded the 50,000 point special bonus.

Star Hawk (c) 1979 Cinematronics.


Star Hawk is a 3-D wireframe shoot-em-up which places a strong emphasis on player timing. Players move a cross hair around the screen and must blast the approaching enemy spaceships.


The skill level settings affect how quickly the cross hairs move in response to the joystick input. As the game progresses, the speed of the enemy craft increases. If one particular enemy ship is not destroyed quickly enough, it will zap 800 points off the player's score, with the enemy itself also worth 800 points.


Star Hawk can effectively be played indefinitely, providing the player keeps shooting enough enemy ships.

Released in March 1979.


Licensed to Sega for Japan market.


Star Hawk was the first arcade game ever released to be based on the film 'Star Wars'. This game literally came out right after the movie. This was an unlicensed translation, but the Tie Fighters and the Death Star inspired background are obvious. This was only the second or third game in history to use an X-Y monitor.


Larry Rosenthal left Cinematronics to form his own company (Vectorbeam). When he left the company, he took all of the development tools that were used for Space Wars with him. Tim Skelly was hired in this time, and was left with nothing to write his games on except for the main board! Luckily, Larry had ran into a time crunch and had to hire a technician to help him out. Tim found the tech, who had the opcodes for the board, and Dennis Halverson was hired to write the macro assembler for the DEC computers used at the company. Cinematronics needed a game, and fast. So rather than wait for the tools to be developed, Skelly wrote Star Hawk on paper using opcodes. The Star Hawk code was the first machine language code that Skelly wrote that actually worked.

Skelly says, "Obviously, things eventually worked out. I managed to crank out Starhawk in time for a winter game show in London. But what still angers me to this day besides being put on the spot like that, is the fact that more than a hundred employees were depending on a new game to maintain their livelihood, and I was clearly chosen as the guy who couldn't come up with one. I think you can see that, under the circumstances, there was no love lost between the Cinematronics and Vectorbeam camps".


Star Hawk came in a large cabinet that had a front that was completely vertical, while the back section sloped away slightly from the marquee. This title actually had two marquees, one with the game logo, and a second one right below it that had some game instructions. The monitor bezel was just tinted plastic with more game instructions below it. The control panel had a pair of odd 8-Way fire button joysticks that looked a bit like handgrips on a childrens bicycle. These were positioned to be used with the right hand, eventually the industry would decide that joysticks go in the left hand, but this one was the other way around. The cabinet features painted sideart of a barely disguised X-Wing swooping down on a barely disguised Death Star, with a few unrelated red and orange bubbles above them.

Star Trek - Strategic Operations Simulator (c) 1982 Sega.


STAR TREK is a 1- or 2-player SEGA Color X-Y video game with computerized speech synthesis. The player finds himself the Captain of the Starship Enterprise, his mission being to rid the universe of a number of threats to the United Federation of Planets.


STAR TREK has a unique method of displaying the information vital to the game play. This method involves the separation of the CRT into three completely separate screens.


The Scanner is where the player sees a top down or plan view of local space, with the Enterprise always in the center of this screen. The Viewer is where the player sees actual apparent 3-D images, as if he were looking out the ships front window. The Status screen displays player score in addition to Shield strength, number of Photon Torpedoes, and amount of Warp energy remaining.


The game begins by introducing Klingons, Starbases and the Enterprise into the Scanner with an exciting shrink down animation sequence. The Enterprise starts with 1 to 4 Shields and Photon Torpedoes (switch selectable). By actuating the rotary knob and depressing the Thrust button the player may maneuver about the Scanner screen.


In order to destroy enemies the player may use either of two weapons : Phasers (the Fire button) or Photon Torpedoes. Each has unique properties.

* Phasers are instantaneous, can destroy only one enemy at a time, and are in unlimited energy supply.

* Photon Torpedoes require time to travel, can destroy many enemies, and are in LIMITED supply. Displayed in the Status screen, Photon Torpedo supply appears as a red bar (squares).


For high speed, the player may depress the WARP button. While this button is held down the Enterprise moves very quickly and cannot be damaged in any way by anything. A blue bar in the Status screen displays the amount of Warp energy available, and shrinks as the Warp button is held down.


The Enterprise is shrouded by an automatic Shield, which protects the Enterprise from enemy fire and collisions. The Shields are displayed in the Status screen as green line segments (a bar). Once the strength of the Shields is depleted, the ship can sustain damage. When damaged, the Enterprise looses ship functions in the following order : Shields, Photon Torpedoes, Warp Drive. If all of these are damaged, the next hit will destroy the Enterprise and end the game.


In order to repair this damage the player may choose to dock with a Starbase. Docking is accomplished by merely flying into a Starbase. The DOCKED message appears, all damage is repaired, and a Shield unit, Photon Torpedo, and some Warp time are added to the ship-s supplies. Although only four of each supply unit is displayed at any one time, 255 can be collected.


The primary enemy is the Klingon Battle Cruiser, which comes in three colors :

* Red Klingon - ignores the Enterprise and sets out to destroy a Starbase, after which the Klingon turns purple.

* Purple Klingon - ignores Starbases and attempts to destroy the Enterprise by firing plasma energy balls. Purple Klingons will stop a certain distance away while attacking so as not to risk collision. After a certain period of time (depending on round), purple Klingons turn white.

* White Klingons - sometimes known as Maniac Klingons, these Klingons will move VERY QUICKLY and attempt to ram the Enterprise.


Anti-Matter Saucers appear randomly and move about the screen in a confusing fashion. These saucers can be destroyed only with Phasers. If the saucer collides with the Enterprise, it will attach itself, drain your ships Warp energy, then leave quickly.


After a number of rounds, the player advances to the Nomad round. In this sequence Nomad zips about the screen depositing dangerous mines. The mines cause chain reactions which should be avoided. Nomad can only be destroyed with Phasers. Once Nomad has delivered its total load of 30 mines, it waits for the last mine to detonate, leaves the screen, and ends the round.


Every 10,000 to 40,000 points (operator selectable) the player is awarded a bonus Shield unit, Photon Torpedo and Warp time unit. The two player game is played with players alternating with each complete round. Whenever a player is eliminated, the other player continues and finishes the game.

Star Trek is Sega's vector color game that came upon the scene in 1982. It featured a screen that was broken down into three parts. It also featured pseudo-three-dimensional graphics. The game is fast paced and in addition to keeping track of all that's going on, you must also be pretty good with the controls. This is another 'sleeper' game that didn't gain a real big following.


- SCORING -


Destroying Enemies :

Klingons : 25 + (round number X 25) Points

Anti-Matter Saucer : 5,000 Points

Nomad : 30,000 Points


Starbase Bonus at the end of a round :

Used Starbase : round number X 250 Points

Un-used Starbase : round number X 1,000 Points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, the Enterprise will be placed into the sector. You will have a 1-2 second delay so take a good look at where everything is at on your radar screen. Your first priority should always be to defend your starbase.


* Try to use your warp as little as possible. On the early waves, you can make it to your starbase and defend it without having to warp to it. On the later waves, however, you will be needing that warp to get to your starbase quickly. Also, you will also be using your warp to get away from the Klingons, especially when they go into suicide mode (turn white).


* As the game progresses, the Klingons get quicker and they maneuver faster to keep out of phaser range.  When you do have a target within your phaser sight, a spinning yellow ring will outline the target.  In addition to faster movement, the Klingons also fire faster so you can lose a ship very quickly in the later sectors.


* It takes 5 shots to destroy a starbase. After the Klingon bomber has achieved that objective, it will change from red to purple and become a normal Klingon fighter that will attack you. Also, you can collide with the Klingon bomber causing the loss of 1 unit of shield energy.


* After sector 20, there are random numbers of Klingon fighters in the sector. If the number is below 4, they may instantly turn white and attempt to ram your ship instead of firing on it.  Before sector 20, if you take too long destroying the Klingons, they will also turn white.


* You want to, as much as possible, avoid resupplying at the starbase. If you don't resupply, you will get a much larger score then if you do resupply. Plus, if you get enough points, you will get additional things anyway. So, bottom line, use the starbase only in the most dire of circumstances.


* You will notice a blue, oval shaped ship on your radar. That is an antimatter UFO and the only thing you can destroy it with are phasers. If you  notice, when you attempt to close in on it, the UFO moves away.  The best way, if you can safely do it, is to move diagonally until the UFO is within your phaser range. Sometimes you get a lucky break and the sector starts with the UFO already in phaser range.


* The NOMAD sectors are probably the most difficult sectors to deal with. NOMAD rapidly moves around the sector laying mines. These mines either detonate after a certain time period or when you hit them with phaser or photon torpedo fire. Keep in mind, if there are a lot of mines packed together, they will all detonate and your ship may be in the middle of it all. The best strategy is to hopefully put up a phaser barrage at the beginning of the sector and take NOMAD out quickly. If this fails, don't move around unless your ship is in danger. NOMAD will eventually return within range. In the later sectors, NOMAD moves very quickly so you have to be very quick on the controls.


* Use your photon torpedoes sparingly since you have a limited number. If you  see an enemy grouping of three or more, shoot a torpedo into the middle. Since photon torpedoes have a blast radius, you can probably take out those three ships with one shot. Again, use only on tight groupings of enemies or when desperate measures require desperate actions.


* Become very familiar with the controls since a moments hesitation could end the Enterprise's 5 year mission prematurely.

Star Wars [Upright model] (c) 1983 Atari.


STAR WARS is a 1-player game with a color X-Y video display. You command LUKE SKYWALKER's RED 5 X-WING spacecraft with Atari's new flight control. Your main goal is to blow up the DEATH STAR. To do this, you must reach the thermal exhaust port at the end of the DEATH STAR trench, and fire a proton torpedo into it.


You must survive 3 phases of play to reach the exhaust port. The first phase of play will engage you in a spectacular battle in space - a war in the stars! TWIN-ION ENGINE (T.I.E.) FIGHTERS from the DEATH STAR attack you. DARTH VADER's ship appears in this phase - menacing and powerful! Your goal in this phase is to shoot the T.I.E. FIGHTERS and their shots.


The 2nd phase of play takes the X-WING down to the surface of the DEATH STAR which is covered with laser bunkers and laser towers. You must avoid collision with these objects and their shots to keep the number of Deflector Shields above zero. Extra bonus points are earned for exploding all laser tower tops.


The 3rd phase of play takes RED 5 down into the DEATH STAR trench. The walls are lined with red laser-gun turrets that fire at you as you approach. You must counter these shots by avoiding them or by shooting them. Trench catwalks also appear, in varied shapes and altitudes. You must avoid hitting the catwalks, or else your number of deflector shields will decrease.


If you survive the flight down the trench, a message and voice will alert you that the exhaust port is straight ahead. You must shoot the exhaust port to explode the DEATH STAR. If you miss the exhaust port, you will plough through the wall at the end of the trench and lose one deflector shield.


If you succeed in blowing up the DEATH STAR, RED 5 soars away from the DEATH STAR and then turns to view the tremendous explosion. Select-a-Death Star bonus and Remaining Shield Energy bonus are now scored. Depending on the settings of the option switches, additional deflector shields will be awarded.


A new DEATH STAR then comes into view. The EMPIRE is really mad now, and the powers in the EMPIRE want to launch LUKE and the RED 5 into eternity!


PLAY MODE


The Play Mode begins in outer space with the DEATH STAR off in the distance. The RED 5 X-WING aiming device (cursor) appears as a crosshair on the screen. As the flight control is moved in any direction, the four laser guns move accordingly. Firing the laser guns will cause alternating laser beams to fire from the guns toward the cursor. In this mode, R2-D2 is controlling the flight pattern of the X-WING based on the flight of attacking T.I.E. FIGHTERS.


Your goal is to blast any and all T.I.E. FIGHTERS and their oncoming shots. If you are hit, your deflector shield will automatically turn on and dissipate the energy from the shot, causing a very bright light to flash on the screen. You will experience a roll in space due to the impact. In a while, the T.I.E. FIGHTERS will turn away from you and fly back to the DEATH STAR.


In the next phase of the Play Mode, the X-WING flies directly toward the DEATH STAR, engines roaring, to a surface covered with hostile laser bunkers and laser towers. Now you, not R2-D2, control the X-WING. Your goal in this phase is to reach the trench. To do this you must avoid or eliminate (by shooting) the structures and the shots fired by them.


The laser tower tops have a progressive scoring incentive that is displayed in a message in the top center of the screen, along with the number of remaining laser tower tops to be destroyed before the X-WING dips into the trench. Eliminating all laser tower tops awards you an added bonus.


Getting hit by a shot or smashing into a laser tower top or laser bunker will roll the X-WING to the right or left as the deflector shield automatically turns on and absorbs impact, displaying a very bright screen. Each collision costs you one deflector shield.

Once you have traveled the required distance over the DEATH STAR surface, the X-WING dips down into the long, deadly trench. In this phase, you can fly right, left, up, or down; but you remain within the trench.


Your main goal while in the trench is to destroy the DEATH STAR by shooting the exhaust port at the end of the trench. You can survive the trench by flying around catwalks, which stretch across the trench at various altitudes, and by avoiding or shooting shots fired from the red laser-gun turrets on the walls. Deflector shield energy is lost if a shot hits you or if you smash into a catwalk. If you successfully reach and shoot the exhaust port, the RED 5 X-WING will soar away from the DEATH STAR and then turn toward it to watch it blow up.


If you miss the exhaust port, you will crash through the back wall and R2-D2 will show his displeasure with you. The X-WING will remain in the trench until the DEATH STAR is destroyed or you run out of deflector shields.


Upon destroying the DEATH STAR, the X-WING returns to another war in the stars with smarter T.I.E. FIGHTERS from a more advanced DEATH STAR. Your ability as a JEDI WARRIOR will be challenged even more with the destruction of each successive DEATH STAR.

Released in May 1983. 10,245 Upright units were sold ate the price of $2,295.


Also released as "Star Wars [Cockpit model]".


The basic game engine for Star Wars was converted from a 2-year old space game project called 'Warp-Speed', which was designed to develop 3-D image capabilities. The controls were adapted from the controls used for Army "Battle Zone".


Star Wars was the first Atari game to have speech. The game featured several digitized samples of voices from the movie. The most memorable was the voice of Obi-Wan Kenobi, after losing the game, stating 'The force will be with you--always'.


Hidden In-game Message : On odd-numbered levels, when approaching the Death Star and right after hitting the exhaust port, the message 'MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU' is visible on the surface of the Death Star. On even-numbered levels, the programmer's names appear on the Death Star :

'HALLY'

'RIVERA'

'MARGOLIN'

'AVELLAR'

'VICKERS'

'DURFEY'


Attract mode has the following screens :


FLIGHT INSTRUCTIONS TO RED FIVE


1. YOUR X-WING IS EQUIPPED WITH AN INVISIBLE DEFLECTOR SHIELD THAT WILL PROTECT YOU FOR 6 COLLISIONS.

2. DEFLECTOR STRENGTH IS LOST WHEN A FIREBALL IMPACTS YOUR SHIELD OR WHEN YOU STRIKE A LASER TOWER OR TRENCH CATWALK.

3. AIM YOUR LASERS WITH CURSOR TO EXPLODE EMPIRE TIE FIGHTERS, LASER TOWER TOPS AND TRENCH TURRETS.

4. SHOOT FIREBALLS BEFORE THEY IMPACT YOUR SHIELD.

5. THE REBEL FORCE IS DEPENDING ON YOU TO STOP THE EMPIRE BY BLOWING UP THE DEATH STAR.


OBI-WAN KENOBI IS GONE BUT HIS PRESENCE IS FELT WITHIN THE FORCE. THE EMPIRE-S DEATH STAR, UNDER THE COMMAND OF DARTH VADER, NEARS THE REBEL PLANET. YOU MUST JOIN THE REBELLION TO STOP THE EMPIRE. THE FORCE WILL BE WITH YOU. ALWAYS


Default high score table (Princess Leia's Rebel Force):

1. OBI 1,285,353

2. WAN 1,110,986

A sequel was planned as 'Star Wars II' the same year (idea form only) with a serial communication concept (link between 2 or more cabinets) - this idea never was born.


The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including STARWARS.


A Star Wars [Upright model] appears in the 1984 movie 'Gremlins'.

Wave 2 : 10,000 points

Wave 3 : 25,000 points

Wave 4 : 50,000 points

Wave 5 and above : 100,000 points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* In the tower scene, you can shoot fireballs that are hidden behind the towers. In the trench scene, you can shoot fireballs through the catwalks.


* Moving the flight yoke far left and far right during the attract mode will switch between the instructions and the high score list.


* In the trench you can 'use the force' and get bonus points by not shooting ANYTHING until you reach the exhaust port. The text 'USE THE FORCE' is shown at the top of the screen until you shoot. The bonus is actually awarded just before you have to shoot the exhaust port, so it's possible to take out some of the gun turrets at the end, too.


* It's rumoured that if you shoot Darth Vader more than 30 times, you get 27 shields. It is said you can also get 255 shields, but this is rare.

Stargate (c) 1981 Williams.


Stargate will transport you to a whole new dimension in video games!  Not only will the skills you learned with Defender be challenged and refined, but new strategies must come into play if you are to be victorious in rescuing the humanoids from the clutches of the aliens and in entering the Stargate!  Your ability to react quickly and with on-target precision will be tested against the evil Yllabian Space Guppies, Dynamos, Space Hums, Firebombers and their Fireballs, Phreds, Big Reds and Munchies! If you succeed in maneuvering your ship into the Stargate, you'll be instantly translocated to that part of the planet where the humanoids are being abducted!  To open up spectacular scoring possibilities, rescue 4 humanoids, re-enter Stargate and you'll Warp 3 Waves ahead in space and time, setting off dazzling special effects and racking up high points!


If you must destroy everything in your path or risk self-destruction, activate the Inviso anti-matter cloaking device and become invisible and invulnerable!  Inviso time plus a new ship and a Smart Bomb are earned with every 10,000 points you score!


If all 10 humanoids in a Wave are abducted, the universe will explode into smithereens, leaving deadly mutants on the attack!  Survive till Wave 5 and the universe will be restored, the humanoids safe ... but you'll be the target of an Yllabian Dog Fight!  There'll be no landers to abduct the humanoids, but all the other aliens will have stronger and larger forces concentrated against you!  It will be an out space battle reaching the outer limits of aggression and will call up your last ounce of determination and courage!

- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1981.


Stargate was the first game designed by Vid Kidz, the design firm founded by Jarvis and DeMar when they decided to go independent. Williams became desperate for a game after the designers left, so they took Vid Kidz under contract. Stargate took four months to complete. All Vid Kidz games were designed on a dual 8" floppy, 1 MHz 6809 Motorola Exorcisor system that cost $30,000 in those days. The name was changed to 'Defender II' right after the game had stopped being manufactured, because Williams wanted to make sure they could own the trademark on the title.


The name of the enemy Yllabian is created by reversing the spelling of Bally, one of Williams' competitors. Bally reversed becomes Yllab.


Shooting a Pod will release between 4 and 7 Swarmers.


Approximately 26,000 uprights and about 1,000 cocktail tables were made.


Stargate plays very similarly to "Defender", although several enhancements have been made to the already superb and demanding game play. Changes from "Defender" :

* The addition of 8 more enemies.

* The addition of the Stargate. Going through the Stargate allows the player to either : 

1) Go to the opposite side of the planet if no Humanoids are being threatened.

2) Arrive at the exact spot where a Lander is abducting a Humanoid.

3) In addition, before Wave 10, if you fly forwards (not backwards) through the Stargate while carrying four or more Humanoids, you will warp forward three waves. You will get a bonus of Humanoids left X 2,000 points for this achievement (Up to 20,000 points).

* The Inviso button allows you to cloak your ship in an anti-matter field.  While cloaked, your ship is indestructible and you can destroy enemies by flying through them. You can still pick up falling Humanoids while cloaked.

* There are now bonus waves in the game. After completing these bonus waves, you start again with ten Humanoids on the planet's surface. The bonus waves are:

1) On Wave 5 and every 10th wave thereafter : The Yllabian Dogfight.

2) On Wave 10 and every 10th wave thereafter : The Firebomber Showdown.

* When the last Humanoid left on the planet's surface is abducted, the planet surface starts flashing, and the message under the scanner reads : 'PLANET SURFACE UNSTABLE!'. This is the warning that planetary explosion will occur soon unless at least one Humanoid is saved.

* There is now a 'Pod Intersection' timer which appears in the scanner at the beginning of any wave which has at least 3 Pods. It counts down to the moment when all the Pods come together.


- SCORING -


Lander : 150 points

Mutant : 150 points

Bomber : 250 points

Pod : 1000 points

Baiter : 200 points

Swarmer : 150 points

Firebomber : 250 points

Fireball : 100 points

Dynamo : 200 points

Space Hum : 100 points

Yllabian Space Guppy : 200 points

Phred : 200 points

Big Red : 200 points

Munchies : 50 points

Getting hit by an enemy bullet : 25 points


Destroying a Pod with a Smart Bomb will award either 1,450 or 1,600 points.


Rescuing abducted Humanoids gives increasing bonuses if they are rescued consecutively without being immediately returned to the ground.

500 points for saving the 1st Humanoid from a Lander, 1,000 points for saving the 2nd, 1,500 points for the 3rd, and 2,000 points for the 4th and higher.

500 points for each Humanoid put back into the planet's surface.

250 points for a Humanoid landing into the ground safely on his own.


A special undocumented bonus can be gained by dropping off a humanoid as the last event in a wave. There are 2 ways to do this. One way requires you to have killed everything off in the wave except for one lander. Wait for the lander to pick up a humanoid. Shoot the lander and catch the humanoid JUST before it hits the ground. The other way is to deposit a humanoid that your ship is carrying at the exact moment when you kill the last enemy of the wave. Either way, when this is done properly the screen will flash several times and you will be awarded 2,000 points.


Bonus at the end of each wave : 

Wave 1 : Humanoids Left X 100.

Wave 2 : Humanoids Left X 200.

Wave 3 : Humanoids Left X 300.

Wave 4 : Humanoids Left X 400.

Wave 5 and all Yllabian Dogfight waves : 2,500 points.

Wave 6 and above : Humaniods Left X 500.

Warp : Humanoids Left X 2,000.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


The enemies that initially appear in each wave are :

Wave 1 : 11 Landers, 2 Dynamos, 3 Firebombers

Wave 2 : 10 Landers, 2 Dynamos, 3 Firebombers, 7 Yllabian Space Guppies

Wave 3 : 10 Landers, 2 Dynamos, 6 Firebombers, 4 Yllabian Space Guppies, 3 Pods

Wave 4 :  17 Landers, 3 Dynamos, 3 Firebombers, 5 Yllabian Space Guppies, 4 Pods

Wave 5 and every Yllabian Dogfight : 6 Dynamos, 22 Yllabian Space Guppies, 8 Swarmers

Wave 6 : 17 Landers, 3 Dynamos, 3 Firebombers, 5 Yllabian Space Guppies, 4 Pods, 2 Bombers

Waves 7, 8, and 9 : 17 Landers, 3 Dynamos, 3 Firebombers, 5 Yllabian Space Guppies, 4 Pods, 3 Bombers

Wave 10 and every Firebomber Showdown : 13 Firebombers, 6 Pods

Wave 11 and every regular wave higher : 18 Landers, 4 Dynamos, 4 Firebombers, 3 Yllabian Space Guppies, 4 Pods, 2 Bombers


If the planet is destroyed, all Landers are replaced with Mutants.


* You start the game in the middle of the screen. You can look at your radar to see where the various enemies are. Get to learn the sounds of the game because they are an important clue as to what is going on out of your viewing range. First of all, learn how to use the buttons with proficiency. You don't want to be hunting around for the smart bomb or thrust button when you are in the middle of a firefight. Practice will make you proficient.


* The player's ship can shoot a maximum of 4 lasers on the screen at any one time.


* Learn to use your radar screen and after a while you will only look at the viewable area briefly to take care of business. Each enemy has a unique color on the radar so you should be able to easily identify what they are. In addition, you will also learn how each enemy moves around. This will definitely become a great benefit in the later waves.


* Listen to the sounds of the game. When you hear a high-pitched chatter, that means a Lander has picked up a Humanoid in order to create a Mutant. Use your radar and look for the green shape going straight up; that's the Lander. Try to get over there as quickly as possible. Just shoot the Lander, not the Humanoid it has taken. When you hear what sound like something being put together, that means a Lander has become a Mutant.


* Once you shoot the Lander, your job isn't over yet. If the height is too great, the Humanoid will fall and die on impact. You have to fly over the Humanoid and your fighter will pick it up. Anytime you scrape against the ground, you will set the Humanoid down. Some players continuously ride around with a Humanoid to prevent the planet from exploding.


* The planet will only explode when all ten Humanoids are dead. Then you will have to go through waves of nothing but Mutants and the other regular enemies until you make it to a bonus wave. After that, you will have 10 humans and a new planet again. Mutants are very dangerous to deal with because they tend to swarm and fire a lot of shots toward your ship. Of course, expert players just shoot all the Humanoids so they can have the challenge of going through these Mutant waves.


* Try to clear waves as quickly as possible. If you take too long on a wave, a Baiter, Phred, or a Big Red will appear. These enemies are much faster than your fighter and can outrun it. The Baiter also has the tendency to fire pretty accurate shots. One of the tactics to throw them off is to reverse quickly a couple of times. This disorients them briefly and may give you a chance to shoot them. These enemies make their appearance to ensure you finish waves quickly.


* Use your Smart Bombs only when the screen is crowded with enemies. A lot of players like to get all the Pods together and then touch off a Smart Bomb. Another way is to break open the Pods so that Swarmers are all over then hit the Smart Bomb.


* Use your Invisio sparingly. A good tactic is to find a lot of enemy units bunched up. Fly fast toward them and at the last second activate your Invisio until you are clear (should amount to less then a second of time). You can destroy quite a few enemies this way and you conserve your Invisio energy.


* Use Hyperspace only when you are in a totally desperate situation (like getting swarmed by Mutants or Swarmers). Sometimes  Hyperspace will destroy your ship on re-entry.


* Watch out for the Bombers. Although they travel slowly, they leave strings of bombs. If you are not paying attention, you may crash if you attempt to fly through them.


* The Firebombers have a tendency to shoot a lot of fireballs at your fighter. Fortunately, you can destroy these fireballs. This can become complicated if there are four or five firebombers firing at the same time. The Fireballs don't track your ship. The Firebombers don't start shooting Fireballs until Wave 2.


* You can fly through and under the terrain (but you cannot exit the screen at the top and come up through the bottom or vice-versa). Use this to your advantage when maneuvering around.


* Since you 'wrap-around' the screen, this gives you a little more maneuvering room. However, keep looking at your radar because the enemy that disappears off the left side will show up on the right side. Also, shots do not wrap around the edge.


* In addition to using the 'wrap-around', keep in mind that you can also use the Stargate to your advantage. Some players hang around the Stargate until a Humanoid is abducted. They go through the Stargate, save the Humanoid, and go back to the Stargate again to await the next rescue. Also, the Stargate is useful if you are being pursued by a lot of enemies since it transports you to the opposite side of the planet.


* Since you get an extra ship, Smart Bomb, and Inviso time every 10,000 points, that should be your constant goal. However, as the waves get higher things move a lot faster, making even getting 10,000 points a challenge.


* The most extra ships or Smart Bombs that can be obtained is 255. If the player has 255 extra ships or Smart Bombs and then wins an extra one, the counter rolls back to zero.


* Secret Message : The formula consists of three sequences of buttons, that all must be completed within a quarter of a second of each other, without the player dying onscreen. The moves are as follows...

1) Joystick Down, Reverse, 1P Start and Thrust.

2) Reverse, 2P Start and Fire.

3) Joystick Down, 1P Start, Thrust and Fire.


*  Stargate attack waves 'roll over' at wave 100, which is displayed, when started and after being completed, as Wave 0. The game keeps track of the actual number of waves, even though they are not shown properly. For example, the next wave will be counted as Wave 101, even though it shows being completed as Wave 1. The game will 'roll over' again at Wave 200, which is displayed, when started and after being completed, as Wave 0 as well. The next 'roll over' occurs at Wave 256. Upon completion of Wave 255, the next wave is a wave very similar to the very first wave, except that the Firebombers shoot. This level is counted and displayed as Wave 0, and the player is awarded a bonus of Humanoids left X 0 points (the bonus for this wave is always 0 points). The next is Wave 1, and the game now plays just as if the player had started a new game (warps are now again possible up to wave 10), except the player gets to keep his score and all of his bonus ships and Smart Bombs.

Strategy X (c) 10/1981 Konami.


Even Patton would spend all his quarters attempting to advance through the four attack levels of Strategy X, Konami's latest tank attack video game.


1st Level : Defend against rotating cannons.

2nd Level : Watch out for attacking Jeeps

3rd Level : Careful! Here come attacking and shooting tanks

4th Level : Rotating cannons again, but this time against a moving background.


An audible signal warns that it's refueling time. Enter a fuel dock and receive 100-300 points. The Tank commander's life isn't an easy one.


Aside from an on-going battle, he has to watch out for obstacles and rough terrain. Brick walls destroy tanks, although they can be shot away. TNT, rather nasty stuff...explodes when shot, but destroys all objects in the area. Stay off pink backgrounds. That's where the land mines are buried. They explode only on contact. Don't worry about a blue background, though. It's a slip zone like an oil slick and can be driven across. If an alien base is found and destroyed, advance to the next level of difficulty. You bet there's a 'buy-in' feature on this one.


Strategy X. There's never been a war game like it. It blows minds, and quarters.

Released in December 2003.


The game was released in arcade form only in Japan and Asia. Versions for North America and Europe were released exclusively for home consoles (see Ports below). The core of the game is based on "Super Street Fighter II Turbo", but now players have up to 5 different versions of each character to choose from.


The arcade intro has reverted back to the one found in "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" with the new addition being the title screens from the previous Street Fighter II games alternating between lightning flashes.


The title screens for the CPS1 games "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition", and "Street Fighter II' - Hyper Fighting" are presented for the first time on the CPS2 hardware via this game's intro.


Though the character select screen layout is the same as the one found in "Super Street Fighter II Turbo", its music has changed back to the character select music found in "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers," which itself is a remixed version of the character select music from the CPS1 Street Fighter II games.


The version of the character corresponds to the Street Fighter II game that they were playable in :

'NORMAL' - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"

'CHAMP' - "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition",

'TURBO' - "Street Fighter II' - Hyper Fighting",

'SUPER' - "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers"

'SUPER T' - "Super Street Fighter II Turbo".


Note : In 1-player mode and attract mode, the CPU only uses the 'SUPER T' version of each character.


The background music playback format has changed since it was introduced in "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers". Previously, the background music will change to the 'KO version' of the music on the second round onward when one of the character loses enough health to cause the KO sign to flash. In this game, the 'KO version' of the music will play on the second round onward only when the character who loses enough health to cause the KO sign to flash is in danger of losing not only the round, but the match as well.


Color schemes for the stage backgrounds are still the same as for "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" and "Super Street Fighter II Turbo". However, a few background elements originally seen exclusively in "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" have returned :

1) The dual barrels and stack of boxes in Ken's stage (from "Champion Edition" to "Super Turbo" there was just a single barrel).

2) The breakable 'Fuurinkazan' signs in Ryu's stage.

3) The lantern on the left side of E. Honda's stage (appeared exclusively on the Nintendo Super Famicom port of "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior").


Conversely, background elements that were present since Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers are now missing :

1) The toucan that flies away at round's end in Dee Jay's stage.


- UPDATES -


In the Japanese version, because of the different titles for some of the SF games in Japan, the names for the character versions are also different:


'DASH' for "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition"

'SUPER X' for "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" (known as "Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge" in Japan)


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Holding Start while selecting 'SUPER' for the version of your character will select the secret 'Super' version of the character as found in "Super Street Fighter II Turbo".

Pressing the Start button to select your character when using the 'NORMAL', SUPER, or old Super version of the character will select them in an alternate classic outfit, used originally when two players simultaneously used the old version of the same character in "Super Street Fighter II Turbo".


* Holding Start while selecting 'Super T' for the version of your character will allow certain characters to 'store' their super combos.

September was the first revision of the game, but most arcades didn't get the game until October 1993.


Here is a list of changes from previous SFII games :

* New title screen with new music.

* Completely new portraits for all characters. M. Bison now has a winged-skull on his hat instead of a star.

* New endings for the bosses. The last part of Chun Li's ending is also modified, letting the player choose whether she should now live a normal girl's life or continue being a detective.

* Vega no longer climbs the fence on his stage prior to doing his 'Flying Barcelona Attack' or 'Izuna Drop' moves. He now just jumps to the edge of the screen and jumps off, as he does in the other stages.

* Voice samples for all characters and announcer re-recorded with different actors. Each character now have their own unique voice so there is no more shared voice samples (e.g. the male 'KO' scream).

* Background music playback is handled differently. The background music will play from Round 1 to Round 2 continuously, until a character causes the KO sign to flash on Round 2, which will trigger the 'KO' version of the music. From Round 3 onward, the music is played in the same format as in previous SFII games.

* Four completely new stage backgrounds with new background music to accompany the New Challengers.

* Color schemes for the 12 original stage backgrounds have changed once again :

1) Ryu stage : The sky is now near evening, and the moon is now white with a touch of light blue.

2) E. Honda stage : The walls are now light blue, and the big picture (excluding the sun) is now red-orange.

3) Blanka stage : The vine where the snake is coiled is now light green, and people to the right have changed a bit. The river behind the village is now a clear blue.

4) Guile stage : The sky is back to daytime, and the Guile's comrades are now dressed in blue. The symbol on the ground is back to blue, but the missile linings are still red.

5) Ken stage : The tugboat has been replaced with a yacht, and a few of the people to the right have changed a bit.

6) Chun Li stage : The sky is now sunset, the 2 customers now wear orange, and the 2nd sign is back to red. 

7) Zangief stage : The stage floor is now green, and the area to the left is now red. In addition, the fence on the left foreground is now lowered a bit.

8) Dhalsim stage : The curtains and stone floor are now green, and the carpet is back to red.

9) Balrog stage : While the stage floor is still purple, the 'Las Vegas' on the floor is now yellow. The car to the left is now blue, and the car to the right is now green. The guy throwing confetti at win/lose, the guy next to the car to the left and the guy next to the car on the right have changed.

10) Vega stage : The stage floor now shows off a green hue, and the fence now comes crashing down at the start of the fight.

11) Sagat stage : Buddhist statue is still gold, and now it's sunset. In addition, a big city is now visible in the distance.

12) M. Bison stage : The sky is now back to daytime, and the guy sitting Indian style praying (and stands up angrily after breaking a big statue) is now dark-skinned. The roof of the palace is now red with green trim, and the linings on the giant bell that were previously red are now black.


A special version of this game is known as "Super Street Fighter II - The Tournament Battle".


While New Challengers Cammy, Fei Long and T. Hawk were created by Japanese employees at Capcom, the Jamaican kickboxer Dee Jay is the first and only Street Fighter to have been created by an American Capcom employee (James Goddard). Dee Jay's pant leg was originally going to have 'MANTIS' written on it instead of 'MAXIMUM'. It was changed so that when the sprite was flipped over (when Dee Jay faces the opposite direction), the letters would not appear to be backwards. That is, all of the letters in 'MAXIMUM' look the same when flipped over, but the 'N' and 'S' in 'MANTIS' will be backwards when flipped.


Fei Long is Capcom's homage to Bruce Lee.


Sony Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Super Street Fighter II Arcade Game Track - SRCL-2822) on 21/01/1994.


- UPDATES -


In M. Bison's ending in the international  versions, Bison says 'Not even the 'Ancient One' dared to challenge me!'.

In the Japanese version, where he's known as 'Vega', he doesn't say anything like this.


Localizations liberties were taken with Cammy's and Fei-Long's endings in the international versions of Super Street Fighter II, changing their whole context. The following are unofficial translations of Fei-Long and Cammy's endings from the Japanese version of the game. Note that Vega (Dictator), Bison (Boxer), and Balrog (Claw) are referred by their original Japanese names.


Fei-Long's ending

After defeating Vega, a film director who witnessed Fei-Long's fight approaches him.

Director : 'That was simply splendid! Your techniques are the real deal! Surely, you must star in my next film!'

Fei-Long : '...Sorry, but now I understand. My true passion is not acting, but real fighting'.

Director : 'Surely you don't mean that. Whatever your price, I'll pay...'

Fei-Long ignores him and walks off.

Director: 'H-hey! Where do you think you're going!'


Screen turns blank

Narrator : '20 years has passed since Hong Kong's action star vanished from the screen...'


We are then shown a crowd of students gathering in a plaza in front of a statue of Fei-Long.

Narrator : 'The Soaring Sky style of Kung Fu currently has over 3 million pupils around the world, and today the plaza has been crowded since the morning with recent converts gathering before the memorial statue of its founder. 'To be strict with oneself' Respected by all of his students, the name of this master was...'


Cammy's ending

After defeating Vega, Cammy walks up to Vega to ask him about her past.

Cammy : 'Vega, tell me the truth! What do you know...about my past?'

Vega : 'Very well. Three years ago, you were a spy sent out on a mission by my organization'.

Cammy : '...!'

Vega : 'It can't be. You really did lose your memories'.

Cammy : 'You're lying!'

Vega : 'I have no intention trying to convince you at this point. Now leave...'


Cammy is now by herself, with a sad look on her face.

Cammy : 'What will I do now?'

The other members of Delta Red (the special forces unit Cammy works) appears to cheer her up.

Cammy : 'Its you!'

Delta Red member : 'Our mission is done. Let's go home'.

Cammy : 'But, I...'

Delta Red member : 'Your past is unimportant. What really matters is your future. We're your friends, aren't we?'

Cammy : 'Thanks... all of you!'

Shot of a helicopter flying off into the sunset.

Narrator : 'The soldiers went back home, looking forward to see their loved ones...'


Some of the voice samples of Cammy and Dee Jay were changed from the Japanese version.

Japanese version quote - International version quote.

* Cammy : 'Spiral Arrow', 'Cannon Drill'

* Cammy : 'Cannon Spike', 'Thrust Kick'

* Dee Jay : 'Slash', 'Max Out'


The US version has the 'Winners Don't Use Drugs' screen.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Each character has 8 outfit colors. Press LP to choose the original Street Fighter II color, MP for the Champion Edition color, HP for the Turbo color, any Kick button or the Start button for one of 4 new colors, or hold any button for 3 seconds for the secret color.

- TRIVIA -


Released in March 1992.


In Japan, the apostrophe-like character on the game's official logo is actually a prime symbol and thus the official title is pronounced "Street Fighter II Dash - Champion Edition". Likewise "Street Fighter II' - Hyper Fighting" is known as "Street Fighter II Dash Turbo - Hyper Fighting" in Japan.


This game is an enhanced version of "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" :

* Added an alternate color scheme for each character and the ability to select boss characters (Balrog, Vega, Sagat, M. Bison).

* Each stage had different background colors from the original (mainly time of day changes), here are the background changes :

1) Ryu stage : now has midnight blue sky instead of red-orange, and has yellow moon.

2) E. Honda stage : the walls are now yellow, the big picture (excluding the sun) is now blue-purple. The 'Victory' sign is now red-orange. The Hiragana Yu on the left is now red.

3) Blanka stage : the snake is now red, and the houses are now wood color.

4) Guile stage : The sky is now sunset. The tinted canopy on the jet is now purple. The symbol on the ground is now red, and the missile linings are now red.

5) Ken stage : The boat is now blue. The 2 guys on top are now wearing brown clothes and teal clothes. The guy in the trenchcoat and hat is now yellow.

6) Chun Li stage : the 2 customers now wear pink, the second sign is now green, the meats on the ceiling are now brown, and the ground is now a darker color.

7) Zangief stage : The floor is now gold and to the left is now copper. The "Attention" flyers are now red with yellow letters.

8) Dhalsim stage : The stage now has blue curtains, silver stone floor, and blue carpet.

9) Balrog stage : The floor is now purple.

10) Vega stage : The stage now sports a dark blue hue, and the Flamenco dancers are now dressed in pink.

11) Sagat stage : Buddhist statue is gold, and the grass is now a darker green. 

12) M. Bison stage : The sky is evening this time. 


* New moves were added for some characters.


* The portraits of Chun Li and M. Bison have been recolored.


* Overall hit damage was reduced (favoring combos attacks instead of special moves).


* Special moves were tweaked a bit (i.e. : the fighting styles of Ryu and Ken were distinguishable from one another)


* The main title screen was changed from black to blue.


* Various cosmetic enhancements were made to each character's physical appearance.


* In "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", Ryu's stage featured breakable 'Fuurinkazan' signs. These signs have been removed in this game and are not seen again until "Hyper Street Fighter II - The Anniversary Edition".


* In Ken's original SFII stage, there were 2 barrels and a stack of boxes which were a single breakable item. From "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition" to "Super Street Fighter II Turbo", there is just a single barrel in Ken's stage. The two barrels and stack of boxes from the original SFII would later return in "Hyper Street Fighter II - The Anniversary Edition".


* Sagat's stage in the original SFII stage had a palm tree in the foreground. The palm tree is gone in this game and does not return.


Various unofficial hacks of this game are known as "V004", "Accelerator Pt+.II", "Rainbow", "YYC", "Kouryu" and "Red Wave".


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Street Fighter II : G.S.M. Capcom 4 - PCCB-00056) 21/03/1991.

US versions are slightly different, they have the 'Winners Don't Use Drugs' screen.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Characters stats : If you enter the classic Konami code Up(x2), Down(x2), Left, Right, Left, Right, MP, LP on the 2nd player side during the demo fight in attract mode, it makes a bunch of zeros appear.

Second line contains 0005 0006 0007 0008 0009 0010 0011 0012 0013 0014 0015 0016


0001 = No idea, probably some sort of 'experience points' for 1P side.

0002 = The no. of coins put in in the left-hand slot.

0003 = Same as 0001, but for 2nd player.

0004 = Same as 0002, but for right-hand slot.

0005 = No. of times Ryu has been used.

0006 = No. of times Honda has been used.

0007 = No. of times Blanka has been used.

0008 = No. of times Guile has been used.

0009 = No. of times Ken has been used.

0010 = No. of times Chun Li has been used.

0011 = No. of times Zangief has been used.

- TRIVIA -


Street Fighter II Rainbow is a special hacked version of "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition". There are some special features in this program. First, the game has increased speed. Midair moves are also possible, just execute your favorite attack in the air. All fireballs (except Yoga Flame) are homing, meaning that they move toward the opponent, even when they jump. All jab fireballs are extrememly slow. Strong fireballs are medium speed. Fierce fireballs are lightning fast, hitting instantaneously. You also have the ability to do multiple fireballs. In other words, you can throw a new fireball before the old one hits. You can climb the screen indefinitely, (jump, do a special move, jump, do a special move, etc.). Also, throws have seemingly unlimited vertical range.


The best part of this game is the ability to switch characters in the middle of a round. This is done by pressing START on the player controller that you are.  Starting with Ryu, the cycle is as follows : Ryu -> E. Honda -> Blanka -> Guile -> Ken -> Chun Li -> Zangief -> Dhalsim -> M. Bison -> Sagat -> Balrog -> Vega


Ryu :

Fierce dragon punch goes across the screen (arcing dragon punch).

Roundhouse hurricane kick goes across the screen.


E. Honda :

Hundred hand slap often fires a Ken/Ryu fireball.


Blanka :

Electricity often fires a Ken / Ryu fireball.

All Rolls arc up. You can do continuous rolls easily by charging for the next roll while rolling and executing it while in the air, at the end of the original roll.


Guile :

Sonic booms are no charge.

Hit your opponent with slow and fast sonic booms at the same time.


Ken :

Roundhouse hurricane kick is fast and travels across the screen. It almost always will dizzy.


Chun-Li :

Lightning Kick sometimes releases a Ken/Ryu fireball.


Zangief :

Hand Spin sometimes throws a fireball.

Try doing the handspin in the air and jumping afterwards.


Dhalsim :

Slide Roundhouse reaches across screen. He wals very fast.


M. Bison :

Psycho crusher is much faster.


Sagat :

Kick button based Tigers take the same effect as punch based fireballs.


Balrog :

Sliding Punches (with the punch buttons) make Ken/Ryu fireballs. Use jab for the best effect.


Vega :

Rolls throw Ken/Ryu fireball.

Released in December 1992.


This game is known in Japan as "Street Fighter II' Turbo - Hyper Fighting".


This ROM upgrade to "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition" was created by Capcom USA employee James Goddard in response to the rampant unauthorized hacks that arcade operators were installing in their SFII' - CE machine to make the game play faster, have mid-air special moves, change characters on-the-fly, and all sorts of other strange things. The hacks made the game interesting again to those who wanted something new in the game, but destroyed the balance of the game.


The Hyper Fighting upgrade was an attempt to incorporate many of the ideas present in the hacks while maintaining game balance. The way those ideas were implemented were taken from "Super Street Fighter II", which was still being developed at the time and was planned to be the direct successor to SFII' - CE before all the unauthorized hacks forced this upgrade to be made. Ironically, this unforseen upgrade is considered the best and most balanced game in the SFII series.


What's new :

* Gameplay was SIGNIFICANTLY sped up to intensify the pace of the game.

* More special moves (ie : Chun Li's fireball, Dhalsim's Yoga Teleport) were added for each character except for M. Bison.

* New color schemes were added for each character (but the color schemes for the stage backgrounds are still the same as they were for Champion Edition).

* The addition of mid-air special moves for Chun Li, Ryu and Ken were introduced.

* Platform graphics (resembling the medal ceremonies in the Olympics) were added to each character's ending, featuring the character you completed the game with at the first-place platform, M. Bison at the second-place platform, and Sagat at the third-place platform. The musical setting for this display was the music from the home stage of the character standing on the first-place platform. (If you completed the game with Sagat or M. Bison, the one you used stood on the first-place platform, the other one on the second-place platform, and Vega occupied the third-place platform.)


- UPDATES -


The US version is slightly different, it has the 'Winners Don't Use Drugs' screen.

Street Smart (c) 1989 SNK.


You begin by choosing one of 2 fighters (either a blond guy, or a dark haired guy in karate gear). Then you are whisked away to one of many cities on the map to have a battle. The opponents are tough, but simple. This game has no special moves (and has only punch, kick, and jump buttons), and all characters have insanely high energy. So you pretty much just wail away at each other with punches and kicks until someone falls down. An ambulance will show up to haul away your defeated opponent, and a girl in the audience will come out to congratulate you.

- TRIVIA -


Released in August 1989.


Street Smart was SNK's answer to the original "Street Fighter" game made by Capcom.


This game could have been a hit (there were almost no fighting games on the market at the time), but they made one fatal mistake. That mistake was making the game co-operative in 2-Player mode. Instead of battling each other, a second enemy would spawn, and the players would work together against both of them. That completely took all the fun and excitement out of playing this game in 2-Player mode. "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" was released about a year later, and most Street Smart games were quickly converted into them.


Some gamers think that the Player 1 character looks like a young Takuma Sakazaki, who'd later be seen in the "Art of Fighting" and "King of Fighters" series. So far, SNK has never officially confirmed if this is so.


The music of the first stage of Street Smart was recycled later in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" in a 2-Player battle.

Strider (c) 1989 Capcom.


A superb, side-scrolling platform/beat-em-up in which the player takes control of 'Strider Hiryu', a ninja-style warrior who must defeat a legendary being known as Grandmaster Meio. Set in 2048, Meio has observed Earth from his dwelling in a far off galaxy, and has created a space station (known as 'The Third Moon') between Earth and its original moon, in order to rule Earth and continue his observation. Armed with a curved sword known as a 'Falchion', Strider must travel the globe (to locations such as the Soviet Union and the Amazonian Rain forest) to find and destroy Meio.


As well as his sword, Strider will encounter many power-ups, including robotic animals called 'Options' (a hawk and a leopard) which help him defeat enemies. He also has the ability to latch onto walls and ceilings using a metallic hook; a concept which really set the game apart from other platformers and allowed for some hugely inventive level design.

Released in March 1989.


This game is known in Japan as "Strider Hiryu".


Strider became one of Capcom's biggest hits in the days before the legendary "Street Fighter II" would turn the company into one of the most important game producers of all time. This was due to the superb graphics and inventive gameplay Strider offered.


Hiryuu did not have his beginnings at the Arcades, but rather at the black and white pages of a manga anthology. The original Strider Hiryuu manga was serialized between May and October 1988 issues of the Monthly Comp Comics and was illustrated by Tatsumi Wada (an alias of Strider's creator, Moto Kikaku or perhaps the other way around). Capcom was heavily involved in the production of the manga, which led to the creation to the later CPS game. The manga told the story of former Strider, Hiryuu, who retired after killing his older sister, Mariya, who went insane for some mysterious reasons. A few years since the incident, Hiryuu is forced out of retirement by Strider director Matic when he tells the news of Kain's capture by enemy forces. The Strider Hiryuu arcade game was released shortly after the manga finished it's run, although the game barely has anything to do with the plot of the manga.


As Strider was made before the fall of Communism, one could take this as a 'cold war'-era game. The main plot of the story revolves around the fact that nuclear war had broken out and a Russian secret weapon went on a rampage, the only people being able to stop it are 'Earth's Final Guardians', the Striders. Hiryu is the youngest of the Striders. Kafazu (the setting of Strider) is yet another obfuscated name (think Gotham City and New York, for you Batman fans). It's actually Kazhakstan. If you don't know what that is, it's a country in central Asia. The number of mosques in Kafazu also reflects the fact that Kazhakstan is a mainly muslim population.


Strider Hiryu was resurrected in 1998 as a character in "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes".

One of the three girls at the end of level 2 appears as a striker character (Ton-Pooh) in "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes".


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Strider Hiryu : G.S.M. Capcom 2 - D25B1001) on 21/05/1989.


- UPDATES -


On the title screen of the English language versions, Strider is written in English on top of the 'Hiryuu' Kanji. The 'Hiryuu' kanji are colored with a purple gradient.


In the Japanese version's title screen, Strider is written in katakana to the left of the 'Hiryuu' kanji. The 'Hiryuu' kanji starts out red, then catches on fire.


In the US version of Strider, Strider Hiryu is missing his yell when swinging his sword.


- SCORING -


When you complete a level, you get the following bonus points...

1 : 5000 points

2 : 8000 points

3 : 10000 points

4 : 10000 points

5 : 30000 points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


1 - During the game you can have the maximum of 2 'helpers'. Every time you get a helper, it will use the 'last' slot available of your life metter, or be, if you receive a damage, you will lose this life-slot and will lose your helper.

2 - Try to 'link' your helper(s) in the 'left-side' slots, because you will lose the helpers only if you get a lot of damage. On the 1st stage, be with only 2 life-slots when catching the helpers, it will maintain they more safe.

3 - If you have only 2 life-slots, and both 2 helpers, try to find the 'tiger' icon, but don't catch it. Get damage until you have only 1 life-slot. Now catch the tiger icon. The tiger will help you a few secondes, and it is over you will own the 2 helpers, but it will use only one slot, the left-slot. You will lose it only if you die (time-over not included).

4 - If you lose a life by 'time-over', your stock of 'helpers' will maintain, and it will keep on the same "slot" of the helpers.

Released in March 1989.


The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Flying Dragon Strider'.


This game is known outside Japan as "Strider".


Strider became one of Capcom's early hits before "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", revered for its innovative gameplay, multilingual voice clips during cutscenes.

If you don't know what that is, it's a country in central Asia. The number of mosques in Kafazu also reflects the fact that Kazhakstan is a mainly muslim population.


Strider Hiryu was resurrected in 1998 as a character in "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes".

One of the three girls at the end of level 2 appears as a striker character (Ton-Pooh) in "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes".


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Strider Hiryu : G.S.M. Capcom 2 - D25B1001) on 21/05/1989.


- UPDATES -


On the title screen of the English language versions, Strider is written in English on top of the 'Hiryuu' Kanji. The 'Hiryuu' kanji are colored with a purple gradient.


In the Japanese version's title screen, Strider is written in katakana to the left of the 'Hiryuu' kanji. The 'Hiryuu' kanji starts out red, then catches on fire.


In the US version of Strider, Strider Hiryu is missing his yell when swinging his sword.


- SCORING -


When you complete a level, you get the following bonus points...

1 : 5000 points

2 : 8000 points

3 : 10000 points

4 : 10000 points

5 : 30000 points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


1 - During the game you can have the maximum of 2 'helpers'. Every time you get a helper, it will use the 'last' slot available of your life meter, or be, if you receive a damage, you will lose this life-slot and will lose your helper.

2 - Try to 'link' your helper(s) in the 'left-side' slots, because you will lose the helpers only if you get a lot of damage. On the 1st stage, be with only 2 life-slots when catching the helpers, it will maintain they more safe.

3 - If you have only 2 life-slots, and both 2 helpers, try to find the 'tiger' icon, but don't catch it. Get damage until you have only 1 life-slot. Now catch the tiger icon. The tiger will help you a few seconds, and it is over you will own the 2 helpers, but it will use only one slot, the left-slot. You will lose it only if you die (time-over not included).

4 - If you lose a life by 'time-over', your stock of 'helpers' will maintain, and it will keep on the same "slot" of the helpers.

Strikeforce (c) 1991 Midway.


Saurian lizard men have overrun all twenty-two planets that form the New Earth Solar System colonies, capturing and mutating the resident human colonies into reptiles to use as slave labour at their stronghold base, the Saurian Mega-Star Apocalypse


In the 3rd game in Midway's seminal "Defender" series, Strikeforce again has the player flying a spaceship over the surface of a series of two-way, horizontally scrolling planets, destroying enemy waves and rescuing humans from the alien invaders; with rescued humans hanging from the underside of the player's ship. Once these tasks have been completed, the mothership arrives to pick up the player's ship, together with any humans they have rescued. Players can decide which planets to attack, when to purchase additional firepower and when to attack the Apocalypse.


Strikeforce's graphics differ from the minimalist, stylish appearance of the first two games in the series; with full colour sprites, multi-layer scrolling and colourful, visceral explosions giving the game its own distinctive look and feel.

Released in February 1991.


If you look at the Today's Victors part of the high score screen, you should see the initials DEF for rank 5, END in rank 6, and ER in rank 7; they spell out the word, 'DEFENDER' (as in the game, "Defender").


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* To reach the ultimate bad guy without having to go through the entire enemy starship, you just play the LEFT player, and get yourself killed at the far LEFT end of the starship (the very beginning). When you reincarnate, you'll be at the far RIGHT end of the board, past the wall (or IN the wall if you weren't far enough left). The boss will not appear until you move to the left past where he should be (though things will start firing at you immediately). Kill the boss, get your free credit, start again. ;)


* Strategy Tip : kill dreadnaughts with one timewarp and one cluster bomb. You always get the time warp back, plus other goodies.


* Score Hogging Tip : clear out all the planets but one, and then fly around from starbase to starbase waiting for dreadnaughts to appear. Pick 'em off using the above method. This gets boring after a while, of course...

- TRIVIA -


Released during October 1979.


Licensed to Sega for Japan market.


The vector game PCB that Sundance ran on was the original Rosenthal design that "Space Wars" used, except there was a lot of cut-and-jumpering done to allow for the varying degrees of intensity that the vectors could show. Hence, the game was quite fragile and none of the machines lasted very long. Sundance had grids in space years before "Tempest". Skelly felt the game lacked the anxiety element needed in a good game and begged Cinematronics not to release it.


Cinematronics tried to make about 1000 of them, but the production fallout rate was around 50%. The problem was the 23'' CRT which was manufactured by an outside vendor. The carbon coating sprayed onto the inside of the tube was defective, and would shake loose and settle around the neck if the game was left in certain positions. When the game was powered up after shipping to the operators, the CRT would instantly burn up from arcing inside the tube. As a result, most Sundance machines suffered a quick death, and were likely destroyed or sent out to pasture in an operators back room.


Sundance came in the same basic cabinet as the more common "Rip Off" and "Tailgunner". It featured flame themed sideart, and also had flames on the monitor bezel and around the coin door. The monitor bezel was orange, in order to give the game a bit of color. Most of these cabinets were instantly scrapped, as game conversions weren't really big in 1979, and a cabinet with a bad monitor isn't very good for a conversion anyhow.

Sunset Riders (c) 1991 Konami.


A superb sideways scrolling shoot-em-up for 1 to 4 players set in America's Wild West. 4 sharpshooter bounty hunters (Steve, Billy, Bob and Cormano) set out to claim the bounties given for killing the most wanted outlaws in the West. The ultimate aim is to survive long enough to reach the final showdown against Sir Richard de la Rose.


Sunset Riders is an incredibly playable game featuring colourful and well-drawn graphics, with a number of humorous visual jokes keeping players entertained. The side-scrolling action takes place both on foot and on horseback, with the action sometimes broken up with a wild west pursuit; such as having to run along the backs of a herd of fleeing Buffalo.


Each level ends with players entering a one-on-one battle against one of the wanted men they have been pursuing. Weapon power-ups can be found and collected to help players in their quest.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


When you're facing off against the first boss, Simon Greedwell, there's a way to fire at him without being hit by his own gunfire. First, all enemies popping out of the house windows need to be cleared away, and the barrel on the left side needs to knocked down, exposing one side of the boss (but make sure you aren't hit and killed by the falling barrel). Then, position your player underneath that side so that he's firing upwards with the left hand at the left side of the boss (this is easier to do if you're holding two guns). If you do this correctly, you'll be able to gun down the boss while his own ammo passes by you harmlessly without touching you.


On the 2nd stage, as you're heading towards the train station where the second boss is waiting, there's an enemy-manned wagon that appears where the occupants throw out at least two logs that you need to jump over, lest you be killed by them. If you can anticipate the appearance of this wagon, you can shoot at the wheel almost instantly upon its arrival to destroy the wagon before they even throw out a single log at you.


On the 4th stage where you face off against the Smith Brothers in the saloon, they throw heavy explosives in your direction, so you need to keep jumping on and off the chandelier and in other directions to avoid their weapons. (Freeing the bar girls will render you intangible for a few seconds.) Don't try to jump onto the platforms where the Smith Brothers are standing while they're still alive, as you can be killed instantly when touching them.


On the 5th stage, the boss, El Greco, carries a whip causing instant death, and a shield. To succeed in hitting him, you need to try and jump around to shoot him from behind, as well as shooting him whenever he jumps, and to do your best to avoid being hit by the whip.


On the final stage, when penetrating Richard Rose's fortress, you need to use the gatling guns provided to blast your way through two large wooden gates. Just jump onto the stands where your player will automatically grab the gun, point the joystick in the right direction and fire. But be careful, as the gatling gun's ammo can kill other players as well as the enemy themselves!

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Angle And Timing Rules...

Free Throws : 41-44 and 46-49% = 1 pt and 3 seconds, 45% = 2 pts and 5 seconds.

Jump Shots : Varies by location, 45% sinks from anywhere ('nice shot'), 5 seconds.

Dunk Shots : Same as above, grants one extra second.

Lose 5 seconds for each turnover, unless game clock is already at :09 or below.


* Speed and time are essential. The big points are scored on the after-game bonuses, and you need to score tons of points to beat the World Champs. Here's how :

1) The primary sweet spot on the floor is the baseline (right edge) on the right (bottom) side of the basket, anywhere inside 3 point range. You can win most games shooting only from here. Dribble there every chance you get and shoot while running out of bounds -- the computer can't block the shot and any reasonably angled shot will go in.

2) The secondary sweet spot is the bottom left corner of the free throw line. Periodically one of your players will post up in this spot -- a quick pass to him results in an easy shot if it's taken immediately. The computer can sometimes stop the play, but it's such a fast striking shot that it can pay off big when time is running low.

3) Basic strategy is score fast, score often, you need the time. Pass north-south, not east-west and you can get around the defenders to the baseline. Take most of your shots from there as outlined above, and you should score fast enough to beat most teams.


* Hint 1 : On bonus shot screens, just shoot like crazy. You can have multiple balls on+screen at once, so don't bother aiming.


* Hint 2 : After about the 4th team, you're better off just avoiding passing altogether as they pick off the balls too often.


* Hint 3 : Move diagonally as much as possible rather than straight forward, and when under the hoop, you don't need to make a full jump to get it in easy - that just makes it easier to be blocked.


* Hint 4 : If you're moving without the ball (say after a shot, to go rebound) it seems that you can run faster if you 'dribble' even though you don't have a ball to do that with.


* 5,000 Point Bonus : When you're shooting free throws, hold down the shoot button until the angle indicator is between 85 and 90 degrees. The ball will go straight up, bounce off the shooter's head, and bounce off the screen, awarding you a 5,000 point bonus.

Super Breakout (c) 09/1978 Atari.


Super Breakout allows the player(s) to select any one of three different action-packed Super Breakout games by turning the game select knob on the control panel to the desired game. The three available Super Breakout modes are the following :


* Double Breakout : before serving the ball, the Double Breakout playfield contains 52 orange bricks (4x13) at the top of the screen and 52 green bricks (4x13) immediately below the orange brick wall.

Two paddles are displayed at the bottom end of the screen. When the serve pushbutton is pressed two balls are served. If the first ball served is missed, it counts as a missed serve and goes against the players allotted serves per game; otherwise the second ball is served. If the second ball served is missed after striking the first served ball, the player may continue with the first ball.


* Cavity Breakout : before serving the ball, the Cavity Breakout playfield contains 44 orange bricks and 52 (4x13) green bricks located immediately below the orange brick wall. At approximately 3 columns in and 2 rows down into the orange brick wall, from both the left and the right side of the wall, two cavities appear. These two cavities occupy the space of 4 bricks (a 2x2 brick area).

One paddle is provided in this game, and only one ball is served, unlike Double Breakout. When enough bricks are removed to release a captive ball from its cavity, the score doubles for each brick removed by any of the two balls in the playfield (as long as the served and freed ball remain active in the playfield). If the third ball is freed and all three balls are played in the playfield, the score triples. If any one of the balls is missed and lost, the score returns to double points. If the second ball is missed and only one ball remains in the playfield, points are then scored as normal.


* Progressive Breakout : before serving the ball, the Progressive Breakout playfield contains 4x13 brick walls (one blue and the other green). The blue brick wall, which consists of 52 bricks, is at the top. Then occurs a space equivalent to this wall. In the middle of the screen is a green brick wall consisting of 52 bricks.

The brick walls move or 'scroll' toward the paddle at a rate determined by the number of hits on the ball. As the bricks are knocked out and the walls progressively creep up on the player's paddle, new bricks enter the playfield at a progressively faster rate; four rows of bricks are always separated by four rows of blanks.

As the brick walls scroll down, their colors change which indicates a new point score for that brick at that instant of time.


- TECHNICAL -


This title was most commonly available in an upright dedicated cabinet, although cocktail versions were also available. The machine featured a cartoon rendering of game-play on both the side-art and the marquee (done up mostly in yellow and brick red). The control panel was decorated with a few stripes and featured a single spinner control along with one button. The game was displayed on a black and white open frame monitor that had a color overlay installed to simulate color. This overlay made the different rows of bricks appear to be different colors.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Ball Speed : Besides the slowest ball speed, right after the serve, there are three possible speed-ups. The first speed-up after the serve occurs on the 4th hit, and a second faster speed-up occurs on the 8th hit. The third occurs after the 12th hit and the fourth occurs when a highpoint (either a 5- or 7-point) brick is hit, regardless of previous speed. Ball speed is restored to slowest value at the beginning of each serve.


* Ball Direction : When the ball intercepts the paddle it will rebound in any of four directions, depending on which portion of the paddle was hit (divide the paddle in four egal portions). This is still the case after the paddle has been reduced to half its normal size. Note that the ball is not allowed to move in a direction perpendicular to the front surface of the paddle or perpendicular to the edge of the paddle. These directions change with the number of hits of the balls. Just like the ball speed changes occur at the 4th, 8th and 12th ball hits.

Super Burger Time (c) 1990 Data East.


Peter Pepper returns almost 8 years after the original Burger Time - and this time, there are more evil things in his way, more tools to deal with them (the classic pepper, a skewer, a frying pan, even a water hose), and bigger burgers to assemble. You even have to fight bosses, by heaving hamburgers at them!

Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Edward Randy, Super Burger Time - PCCB-00061) on 21/04/1991.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Unlike in the original Burger Time, your weaponry is time-limited instead of limited in number of uses. Also unlike the original, hitting an enemy enough times with your weapon will knock them off the screen. If your weapon runs out of time, you'll be left unarmed until you can get another from the windows on either side of the screen. Don't be afraid of hammering your fire button - but also remember, you get extra points if you trap an enemy beneath a falling burger piece, so it may be in your best interests to merely stun them and then drop a topping on them, depending on the situation.

Super Cobra (c) 1981 Konami.


The object of the game is to invade 10 SUPER COBRA defense systems of increasing difficulty and safely pick up the BOOTY.


Use the joystick to move up, down, accelerate and decelerate. Use the Laser and Bombs to destroy defenders. Hitting tanks scores Mystery Value worth 100, 200, or 300 points. Rockets, Tanks, Missiles, and UFO's may all fire at invader. Hit fuel tanks for extra fuel for CHOPPER. The Chopper uses up fuel as it flies, except in between defense levels.


At 10,000 points, the player is awarded a BONUS CHOPPER.


At the end of the game, the player can continue at the defense level he left off on by depositing extra coins and pressing the discharge button on the left-hand side of the panel.


If the Booty is destroyed on the BASE level, the player may try again. When the Booty is safely recovered, a Bonus Chopper is awarded and play resumes at defense level Number 1 where the fuel is used up faster and the defenders fire more often.


SUPER COBRA Defense Level Descriptions :

*  Fuel Tanks appear on every defense level.

*  Tanks appear and fire on all levels except level 8 where they do not fire.

Level 1 - Player must maneuver the chopper over mountainous terrain against fast and slow firing rockets.

Level 2 - Chopper faces Arcing missiles over a mountain terrain.

Level 3 - Smart Bombs flying in groups of 4 over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.

Level 4 - Single Smart Bombs over mountainous terrain. Again, Rockets appear but do not fire.

Level 5 - Chopper flies through a cavern-like terrain against Falling Mines.

Level 6 - Rapidly firing, Roving Tanks over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.

Level 7 - Maneuver through a field of meteors which explode when hit with bombs or 3 times with Laser, plus a single, green, shadow meteor directly in front of Chopper which explodes when hit 5 times with Laser. Rockets appear but do not fire.

Level 8 - Chopper flies over mountainous terrain against rapidly firing UFO's. Tanks and Rockets appear, but do not fire.

Level 9 - Chopper faces arcing missiles over tall buildings. Level 10-Firing rockets in a Building Maze.

Base - Player must maneuver the Chopper over tall buildings against arcing missiles and rapidly firing tanks to reach the Booty and safely carry it away.


- TECHNICAL -


Super Cobra came in the standard 'Stern Cabinet' which was the same one used for "Scramble", "The End", "Berzerk", and many others. This title features painted 'Stern' sideart and uses a vertical monitor. The marquee is reddish and shows a helicopter, a few missiles and a very 70s looking 'Super Cobra' logo. The control panel uses a single 8-Way leaf switch joystick which is mounted centrally, FIRE and BOMB buttons are on either side (meaning you can play this title with either hand).

- TRIVIA -


Super Cobra came out at the same time as "Scramble". While Scramble only went through five areas to the base, Super Cobra went through ten areas. Super Cobra also had more enemies to deal with besides the missiles such as gun batteries and sidewinder missiles. The premise, though, is the same. Penetrate the enemy defenses to make it to the base to pick up the booty. What do you have against all this defense, you have your Super Cobra of course. It will, though, require all of your skills as a pilot to be able to go the distance to get the booty. This game never gained the popularity of Scramble but it still remains a cult classic and actually seems to have had better staying power then Scramble. Perhaps the reason was because it was more of a challenge, who knows.


A Super Cobra unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your helicopter will be at the left side of the screen. Keep in mind, this is a scrolling game. This means you can go no faster then the right side and no slower then the left side. You can, however, vary your speed in-between by pushing the joystick back and forth. The biggest key in getting through this game is learning how to use the joystick to speed up and slow down because you will sometimes be put into some very tight areas that will require precision joystick control. You will hit a clear area and a message will come up such as '1000 miles cleared', '2000 miles cleared', etc... until your reach the base.


1ST AREA :  This is a basic introductory area. It will allow you to get used to the controls while the threat level remains relatively low. The area is a mix of both mountainous and city.

a) Learn how to vary your speed and you can drop bombs with pinpoint precision. You can only have two bombs on the screen at any one time. You will have to go close to the surface to really make a difference. The biggest threat is the missiles that rise up to meet you.

b) Fuel is a very precious commodity in this game. Don't take a chance trying to bomb a fuel tank. It's better, if you have a flat section, to take out what's under your rocket, and strafe the rest of the way. This way, you ensure you can hit the fuel tank or tanks.

c) Watch the terrain. Sometimes you may be cruising when a mountain will appear suddenly requiring quick reflexes and space you may not have.

d) You also need to watch out for ground fire from the gun batteries. They tend to fire random shots and if you aren't careful, they will hit your helicopter.


2ND AREA : This area introduces you to the sidewinder missile. These missiles are unusual in the fact that they fire at an arc and come back down again. This means your helicopter can get hit two ways. Of course, if it misses your helicopter, it tends to sometimes be helpful by taking out other ground targets such as missiles and gun batteries. The terrain is mountainous.

a) Follow the same pattern as you did in the 1st Area. This time, you need to be wary of the sidewinder missiles.

b) As always, make sure you keep a high fuel level and watch out for those gun batteries.


3RD AREA : You get to deal with the red UFO's in this area. Also, the mountains will get steeper and create ''choke points'' at the top of the screen. Of course, you will have to contend with the UFO's coming through the other side. The terrain is mountainous.

a) The red UFO's aren't too difficult to deal with. They have a tendency to stop in pairs, then come at your helicopter. Again, it's easy to shoot them down.

b) The biggest threats are the 'choke points'. You usually will arrive at the same time as a UFO to see who's first over the mountain. This will require quick reflexes.

c) Even though no missiles come up at you, the gun batteries will still harass you.


4TH AREA : This is a continuation of the 3rd Area. Except this time the area you are flying in is significantly narrowed to a point where it seems like you are going through natural caverns. Use the same methods as the 3rd Area.


5TH AREA : You will have to deal with threats both from above and below in this area. There are missiles in the ceiling of the caverns that will drop down. Although missiles aren't firing from the ground, you still have to deal with gun batteries. The terrain is mountainous and caves.

a) You will have to be real careful in this area, the missiles in the ceiling are pretty concentrated. You will have to be able to speed up and slow down on a dime to avoid them or to shoot them.

b) Don't get too close to the ground since the terrain goes from mountains to canyons very quickly.

c) As already mentioned, get fuel and avoid ground fire.


6TH AREA : The main threat in this area is the fact the gun batteries now move. That's right, they track right along with your helicopter until they hit an obstacle. They travel equally well in the canyons as well as the mountains. This makes them especially dangerous since they are firing at the same time.

a) You will have to accelerate and decelerate frequently to 'fool' the moving gun batteries.

b) When you destroy ground targets, be selective in which ones you hit because if you hit targets in the path of the moving gun batteries, you just allow them to travel farther.


7TH AREA : This area is a little trickier since you now have fireballs coming at your helicopter. In addition, there is a green fireball that likes to track your helicopter and prevent your shots from gaining any distance. It takes seven shots to take out this fireball.  The terrain is mountainous.

a) You will be staying in the valleys most of the time in this area. This is a good time to shoot things up on the ground since again, the missiles won't fly up at your helicopter. Gun batteries, though, will continue to harass you.

b) Timing again is important in this area since there are hills in the valley you must cross over. Of course, the tops of these hills are exposed to the fireballs. Time it so that right after a fireball passes over a hill, accelerate and drop into the next valley. Then decelerate in preparation for the next hill.


8TH AREA : This is repeat of the 3rd area except this time you will be dealing with 'chains' of white UFO's.  Use the same tactics as the 3rd Area.


9TH AREA : This is a very short city area. Just watch out for sidewinder missiles.


10TH AREA : This is the area that will get most players. The movements have to be precise in the caves or you will end up part of the wall.

a) Learn quickly when to accelerate and decelerate within the caves. Right when you come to a ledge, push the joystick all the way back and start lining up for the next cave. Accelerate quickly through it, decelerate and repeat this pattern.

b) Don't worry about running out of fuel in the caves, there are plenty of fuel tanks to top your helicopter off. Plus, you will need all that fuel for not only navigating through the caves, but also the base since it doesn't have any fuel tanks.


BASE : This is the second hardest area that gets a lot of players. You have to be very precise in your movement. You will have to deal with gun batteries firing at you while you are trying to pick up the booty.

a) You will see the KONAMI sign atop one of the buildings. Once you see this, you need to decelerate rapidly and drop down quickly to the shorter building next to the base. Once you almost clear that building, you will have to rapidly decelerate, drop down, grab the booty, and rise quickly to avoid the building on the right.

b) If you fail to grab the booty on a pass, the screen will repeat itself until you either destroy the base or run out of rockets to use on it.


Once you have completed the Base, the action goes back to the 1st Area again. Things, however, will speed up. Fuel consumption is quicker and the enemies also are faster.

Super Contra - Alien no Gyakushuu (c) 1988 Konami.


This sequel to the 1987 original is set during the month of December in the year 2634. A disturbing distress signal from General Hal - who was on his way to South America in preparation for the GX Army's 7th military maneuvers- is received, reporting that the GX Army has suddenly revolted. The top branch of the federation forces calls in Bill and Lance to investigate the situation.


They arrive at the base ruins, only to find out that the GX Army's troops were being possessed by the same kind of mutated creatures they fought at Galuga in the original "Contra". The situation is worsened by the fact that Bill and Lance will be killing their former comrades-in-arms.


Super Contra plays identically to its predecessor, with the usual mix of run-and-gun gameplay. The main difference was that the into-the-screen stages of the original Contra were replaced by overhead stages. In addition, weapons were now upgradable and represented by the actual guns themselves as opposed to the letter icons of the first game. Players have also gained the ability to duck underwater to avoid being shot. There are a total of five levels, many of which have sub-bosses.


Super Contra's weapon Power-ups are as follows : 

* Machine gun.

* Grenade launcher.

* Spread gun.

* Laser.

Super Contra (c) 1988 Konami.


The sequel to "Contra", released a full year after the original On December 2634, a disturbing distress signal from General Hal - who was on his way to South America in preparation for the GX Army's 7th military maneuvers- is received, reporting that the GX Army has suddenly revolted. The top branch of the federation forces calls in Bill and Lance to investigate the situation.


They arrive at the base ruins, only to find out to be attacked by the members of the GX Army. Bill notices the pale blue skin and the lifeless eyes in their former allies and begins shooting at them. As it turns out, the GX Army is being possessed by a mutated form of the alien creatures they fought at Galuga. And so the battle between the Contras and the aliens has begun again.


Super Contra plays identically to its predecessor, with the usual mix of run-and-gun gameplay. The main difference was that the into-the-screen stages of the original Contra were replaced by overhead stages. In addition, weapons were now upgradeable and represented by the actual guns themselves as opposed to the letter icons of the first game. Players have also gained the ability to duck underwater to avoid being shot. There are a total of five levels, many of which have sub-bosses.


The available weapons in the game are as followed :

* Machine Gun - Fires bullets at auto-fire. The upgraded version increases the firing rate to a near-ridiculous speed.

* Bomb Launcher - Fires bombs that spreads fire when it hits its target. The upgraded version causes bigger explosions.

* Laser Rifle - Fires a powerful laser beam once per shot. The upgraded version fires a larger beam.

* Spread Shot - Fires a three-way shot. Increases to a five-way spread after the upgrade.

* Mega Shell - Available only in the top-view stages. After picking it up, the player can launch it by pressing the jump button and kill all on-screen enemies.


The stages are as follow :

* Area 1 - Outer Base (side-view) - Takes place in a military base overrun by possessed soldiers. Bosses includes a manned tank and a possessed helicopter. At the end of the level, the player must destroy a core protected by a pair of snipers and a grenade thrower to gain entrance to the next area.

* Area 2 - Inner Base (top-view) - Inside a tank hanger filled with manned tanks and cannons in addition to enemy soldiers. The boss at the end is the Hyper Electric Magnetic Tank Magnus, which is operated by three gunners.

* Area 3 - Jungle (side-view) - Enemies come from trees as the player progress through the level. The player will sometime have to cross a lake, which they can hide underneath to avoid fire. As the player reaches the end of the level, they begin fighting against alien eggs that produce facehugger-like creatures (the same ones featured in the original game). The boss at the end is an alien shrine with a skull.

* Area 4 - 1st Alien Lair (side-view) - Takes place inside an alien nest. The enemies are now xenomorph-like creatures and mouths that shoot alien spawns. The sub-boss is an alien hovercraft composed of skulls, while the actual boss is a flying alien.

* Area 5 - 2nd Alien Lair (top-view) - The final stage, filled with mouths emerging from the ground, flying heads and spider-like creatures. The final boss is Gaver, a giant alien head with snake-like arms. After destroying the final boss, you can see a small alien spawn which flies off-screen if you pay close attention.

Super Dodge Ball (c) 1996 Technos.


The popular game of Dodge Ball is a rather unique sport in which teams of three players try to knock each other out with the help of special moves and team attacks. In this game you take control of a team and must beat all other teams (you can even recruit the other team's leader after beating them!) in order to face the  current Dodge Ball champion and take the title. Features cool anime style graphics, catchy music & great sound effects, plenty of moves at your disposal and a solid challenge level. Dodge Ball anyone? :)

- TRIVIA -


This game is known as "Kunio no Nekketsu Toukyuu Densetsu" (literaly 'Kunio's Hotblooded Dodgeball Legend').


This game runs on the Neo-Geo MVS but was not released on the Neo-Geo AES home console.


This is yet another game by Technos that features characters inspired by the River City Ransom manga. In the overhead map at the beginning of each match, all characters are drawn in a comical small body style, apparently as an homage of the famous NES games that featured the River City Ransom characters.


Kunio appears in "Renegade" as main characters.


- UPDATES -


The International versions of this game are almost identical to the Japanese version (no voice cuts as in the Magical Drop games), only the title screen is completely different & the fact that Shinji's taunt is censored outside Japan (Instead of merely shaking his fist angrily at his opponents, Shinji gives them the middle finger!).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Characters turn VERY slowly in this game, this means that you can score free hits if you either run past them and smack them with the ball, or pass the ball to a teammate that has already been defeated!


* Beat the game without continuing to see a special screen after the credits with all the characters grouped together.

Super Hang-On [Sit-Down model] (c) 1987 Sega Enterprises, Ltd.


For this sequel to the superb 1985 original, Sega introduced the hilly, undulating roads that had been executed so superbly in 1986's "Out Run". The already fantastic game-play was further enhanced with the introduction of the 'turbo' : upon reaching the bike's maximum speed, players could press and hold the turbo button and push the bike to a breathtaking speed - something that was necessary to beat the game's extremely tight time limits. This had to be used judiciously, however, as the increase in speed made the bike harder to control and accelerating at the wrong time would invariably see a head-on collision with the many road-side objects that litter the stages.


Players could chose to race on any one of Super Hang-on's four courses : Africa, Asia, America and Europe. Africa is the easiest and shortest of the 4, with each subsequent course becoming both more demanding - with tighter bends and more aggressive rival racers - and having a greater number of stages to have to beat. Africa, for instance, is made up of only 6 stages, while the hardest course, Europe, has 18 stages.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Easy defense : When on defense, pick the Suicide defense and take control of either one of the 2 nose guards. Hold down the Turbo button and direction yourself at the quarterback before the ball is even snapped. On virtually every single play, you'll blast through the line and nail the quarterback before he can even move regardless of whether or not the play is a run or pass, simply because the offensive line never bothers to block you when this trick is performed.


* Easily block kicks : When the computer is going for a field goal or extra point, take control of one of the defensive players all the way in the back of the field goal block formation. When the ball is snapped, run at the long snapper, then turbo at the kicker and jump. The glitch comes in the form of the long snapper never bothering to try blocking you, and you'll be able to block virtually any kick with ease.

Released in May 1981.


This game is an enhancement hack of "Missile Command".


GCC [General Computer Corp.] was founded in 1981 during the onset of the video game craze. C.E.O. Kevin Curran and MIT classmates Doug Macrae and John Tylko began by developing an enhancement for Atari's "Missile Command" and went on to create "Ms. Pac-Man", still one of the top-selling coin-operated video games in history. Between 1982 and 1984, GCC developed a total of 58 consumer electronics products that generated over $800 million in revenue for Atari and Bally Manufacturing.


- UPDATES -


Differences from "Missile Command" are :

* A new look to the game : different colors, different attract mode, etc.

* A new play to the game : more missiles, faster missiles and clouds that get smaller as the game goes on add challenge (and profit) to your Missile Command box. Plus a Totally New Attack Object, the 'UFO', which moves faster and more randomly than ordinary planes and satellites and fires a deadly new Laser weapon.

* A new sound to the game : each attack object now has its own brand-new sound that lets everyone know that this is no ordinary "Missile Command".

In this platform game, you are a mouse collecting a stash of food that happens to be scattered around the house. Opposing you are cats and cobras, which pop up out of nowhere. You're not exactly helpless, though. You have balloon bombs which you can lay and detonate, rocks on top of the house to drop, floors that move across when you step on them and pools of water under bridges which you open by walking over them.

Super Pac-Man (c) 1982 Namco.


SUPER PAC-MAN is a 1- or a 2-player game. When playing this game, you are in complete control of SUPER PAC-MAN. He will go wherever you tell him to. And he just loves to eat all the different maze objects (APPLES, BANANAS, DOUGHNUTS, HAMBURGERS, etc.). However, he doesn't like the four ghosts, BLINKY (red), PINKY (pink), INKY (turquoise), and CLYDE (amber) because they feel the same way about him as he does about the maze objects.


But SUPER PAC-MAN can turn the tables on these four ghosts for short periods of time during each maze. All he has to do is let them get fairly close in their pursuit of him and then eat one of the POWER DOTS that every maze has in it. When this happens, it causes the four ghosts to turn blue with fright no matter where they are in the maze. This is because they know that when he eats a POWER DOT it gives SUPER PAC-MAN the ability to eliminate them. However, he can ONLY eliminate them for as long as they are blue.


The ghosts will only stay blue for a few seconds after SUPER PAC-MAN eats a POWER DOT But they do give a warning BEFORE they turn back to their original colors - they start to flash.


As your skill level increases, the 4 ghosts speed up their pursuit of SUPER PAC-MAN and they stay blue for shorter and shorter periods of time after he eats a POWER DOT until, in the VERY high number mazes, they do not turn blue at all.


Bonus players can be awarded to you as you reach or pass certain preselected point values.


A major new feature of your SUPER PAC-MAN game is that there are two SUPER POWER DOTS in each maze that, when eaten, will cause your PAC-MAN to turn into a SUPER PAC-MAN. SUPER PAC-MAN can go anywhere within the maze and eat anything that can be eaten. Nothing can stop him.


The object of the game is to HAVE FUN and survive as long as possible while constantly improving your skills, eating as many maze objects as you can, and eliminating as many ghosts as possible. As you do this, each following maze will be harder and harder to complete.


PLAY MODE


The Play mode begins when the 1 PLAYER or the 2 PLAYER start button is pressed. STAGE 1 - 10 PTS is displayed and then PLAYER - READY! is displayed below the GHOST HOUSE on the screen.


The Play mode ends when your last SUPER PACMAN has been eliminated. When this happens, PLAYER - GAME OVER is written across the center of the monitor screen (below the GHOST HOUSE).


The game consists of a single maze with side exits. The items that your SUPER PAC-MAN wants to eat are located in maze corridors with locked doors at every possible entrance to them. You must direct your PAC-MAN to eat the KEYS positioned around the maze in order to gain access to these sealed corridors. The only other way he can get at the food he wants to eat is to eat the KEY that opens the door to one of the two SUPER POWER DOTS in each maze and then eat that SUPER POWER DOT.


When he does this, your PAC-MAN grows to SUPER size and can munch his way through all the locked doors in the maze. YOU can give YOUR Pac-Man SUPER SPEED while he is SUPER size by pressing the SUPER SPEED button on the control panel. He will now move through the maze at a much faster pace. However, you will find that he is harder to steer when he is traveling at this SUPER SPEED and you will also notice that he stays SUPER size for a much shorter period of time when traveling at SUPER SPEED.


At the beginning of each game, SUPER PAC-MAN appears right below the center of the GHOST HOUSE while the 4 ghosts appear at the GHOST HOUSE. BLINKY appears outside the doors and PINKY, INKY, and CLYDE appear inside the GHOST HOUSE.


When play begins, BLINKY (who'd love to eliminate him) immediately begins looking for SUPER PAC-MAN (who immediately begins eating KEYS just as fast as he can). As time passes, PINKY, INKY, and CLYDE (who'd also love to eliminate him) leave the GHOST HOUSE one at a time and begin looking for SUPER PAC-MAN - who is still busily eating KEYS and maze food just as fast as YOU can steer him to them.


But with all 4 ghosts chasing him, it is not as easy to eat the KEYS and maze food (without being eliminated by a ghost) as it was earlier in the game. And BLINKY, PINKY, INKY, and CLYDE are four VERY, SMART ghosts. For instance, they will divide up 2, 3, or 4 ways to try to trap SUPER PAC-MAN between them, in a corner, or even in one of the tunnels. You've really got to watch them! It seems like they always have some sneaky new trick up their sheets.


However, if they get too close, SUPER PAC-MAN can always eat one of the flashing POWER DOTS. When this happens, it causes all four ghosts to turn blue with fright no matter where they are in the maze. This is because they know that when he eats a POWER DOT it gives SUPER PAC-MAN the ability to eliminate them. But, he can ONLY eliminate them for as long as they are blue. And they will only stay blue for a short period of time. But the ghosts do give a warning BEFORE they turn back to their original colors - they start to flash.


When SUPER PAC-MAN eliminates a blue ghost, its point value appears on the monitor screen at the place where the ghost was eliminated while at the same time being added to your score, and the ghost disappears - all except for its eyes. The eyes go back to the GHOST HOUSE where they get another body of their original color. This done, they leave the GHOST HOUSE again and take up their pursuit of SUPER PAC-MAN once more.


When he eats the last item of any particular maze : all movement stops immediately, the maze flashes and disappears. Next, the game displays 'STAGE __  - __ PTS' and the next maze appears. All the players are in the new maze when it appears. The words PLAYER - READY! are also there - right below the "GHOST HOUSE". After a second or two passes, the words PLAYER __ READY! disappear and play begins.

You MUST eat all the food in any particular maze in order to advance to the next one.


The maze identifier symbols appear at the bottom edge of the monitor screen.


As your skill level increases, the four ghosts speed up their pursuit of your SUPER PAC-MAN and they stay blue for shorter and shorter-periods of time after he eats a POWER DOT until, in the high number mazes, they do not turn blue at all.


Bonus players can be awarded to you as you reach or pass certain preselected point values.


When one of the ghosts happens to eliminate one of your SUPER PAC-MEN, assuming you have at least one remaining in reserve, the maze disappears. Next, the game displays STAGE __ - __ PTS and the maze re-appears. All the players are in the new maze when it reappears. The words PLAYER - READY! are also there - right below the GHOST HOUSE. After a second or two passes, the words "PLAYER - READY!" disappear and play begins anew.


When one of the ghosts eliminates your LAST SUPER PAC-MAN, the words GAME OVER are displayed below the GHOST HOUSE, your score is displayed under 1 UP, and in addition, if your score was the highest on this game to date, it will also be displayed under HIGH SCORE at the top center of the monitor screen and go into the HIGH SCORE/INITIAL MODE. If your score was NOT the highest but was still one of the best five scores to date, the game will then also go into the HIGH SCORE/INITIAL MODE.

Released in October 1982.


Also licensed to Bally Midway for US manufacture and distribution (November 1982).


In this new Pac-Man game, the game-play mechanics have altered radically - instead of eating dots, the player is required to eat a key, which unlocks a section of the maze containing some kind of food. Once all the food is eaten, the player advances to the next level. The new game-play mechanics were considered by many to be confusing, and too much of a change from the original two games ("Pac-Man" and Ms. Pac-Man). Ultimately, Super Pac Man proved to be the least successful game in the original series, being outsold that year by "Pac-Man Plus", a slightly updated version of the original game. In spite of this, the game's A.I. was celebrated as being one of the best of that era, and in the eyes of many fans, was the best out of any Pac-Man game.


The alien spaceship "Galaxian" makes an appearance in this game as the food item of stage 15.


A Super Pac-Man unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Easter Egg :

1) Enter service mode.

2) Keep Button 1 pressed and enter the following sequence : Right, Down(x2), Left(x4), Up.

'(c) (p) 1982 NAMCO LTD.' will be added at the bottom of the screen.


* Try to group the ghosts together, and lure as many as possible at once behind you before collecting a powerpill (3,000 for all 4 monsters).


* Note that you can kill the ghosts in their home, so on the early stages you can kill all 4, then collect another powerpill and kill them in their base as soon as they regenerate. This gives you another few seconds breathing space as well.


* At the early parts of each level, concentrate on picking up as many keys as possible before collecting any treats. This way you open up a lot of the maze, saving grief later on.


* When you are fully powered up, collecting a normal powerpill extends your power-up time. The super power does last longer than a normal powerpill.


* When you are fully powered up, try and break through any remaining doors to save you from having to collect all the keys.


* Don't worry about the bonus star in the center - it's not worth wasting time waiting to try and match the items as you score far more points in general play on later levels.


* Although the maze layout is always the same, the keys on later levels open different doors, so you can't rely on the same patterns on each screen.

Super Pierrot (c) 1987 Universal.


Whoo hoo, this game is nothing but dot eating fun. You play the game one screen at a time, and each screen will be covered with dots, baddies, and will have a few logs thrown in to boot. What you are trying to do is either eat all the dots, or kill all the monsters. There are two basic kinds of enemies (plus a few more that will sometimes escort the bonus letters). The first kind is a sort of green clam, these are slow moving and pose little danger to your Mr. Do!. But the second kind is fairly dangerous, it is a purple cartoon snake, and it will make quick rolling attacks at your poor little Do!, you must dodge these, as your powerball is ineffective against a rolling snake. Both enemy types will sometimes transform into a purple sightless unicorn if they manage to remain alive long enough, shoot the unicorns as soon as they appear, because you cannot outrun them over long distances.


Mr. Do! has two things to defend himself with. The first is the superball, he starts out carry this, simply toss it at an enemy, and they will vanish (you can also bounce the superball off of walls for a higher score). Your superball regenerates as you eat dots and fruit, and it is often a good idea to use it as soon as it regenerates (to take out yet another baddie). Your other weapon is the logs that are scattered around the game board. Simply push them, and they will roll down the screen, taking out anything in their path (including Mr. Do! if you are dumb enough to get in their way).


You leave a line behind you as you walk, when you meet your own line (creating a box), any dots inside the box will be upgraded to cherries, while cherries upgrade to apples, which upgrade to lemons, which finally upgrade to pineapples. You don't have to do any of this fruit upgrade stuff at all, but is the best way to rack up a lot of points. You can collect letters to spell EXTRA to get a free man (just like all the other Mr. Do! games).

- TRIVIA -


This game is known outside Japan as "Do! Run Run".


Because of the video game crash of 1983, Universal decided to release their final Mr. Do! game as a conversion kit only, because the market for dedicated cabinets had all but dried up at this point (but it was a full kit that would fit any cabinet, not just a kit for other Mr. Do! games). This kit is fairly rare, and is almost impossible to find today. The kit contained a new PCB and new graphics for the machine, the graphics were purple themed, and the marquee had a 'DO! Run Run' logo superimposed over a purple geometric landscape with a blue line running randomly about it.


Bootleggers ported this title to the very similar "Mr. Do's Castle" hardware, although that version is fairly rare.


- UPDATES -


The maze graphics are slightly different than "Do! Run Run".


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hint : Try to make concentric circle patterns from the outermost edge in, 'eating' the outermost cherries, dots or whatever each time. This will allow you to get a ton of pineapples, which score the most, and will get you a good score in early stages before it gets difficult.

Super Punch-Out!! (c) 1984 Nintendo.


A slight update of the superb "Punch-Out!!" boxing game that features five brand new larger-than-life opponents. The player once again assumes the role of a green-haired boxer who must fight his way up through five larger-than-life boxers to earn the title of 'Champ'.


The player's in-fight boxer is again viewed from behind and rendered with wire-frame graphics (so the player's opponent can be seen). Punches, dodges and blocks must all be well-timed in order to defeat the opposing boxer. Thanks to the refined roster of new and hugely distinctive enemy fighters, "Super Punch-Out!!" is considered to be an improvement over the first game.

- TRIVIA -


Released in September 1984.


The image used for the background of "Punch-Out!!" (in which Mario, Luigi, DK and DK Jr. sit on both sides of the ring) was recycled for 'Super Punch-Out!!'. The only difference is that the background is in black and white.


Not to be confused with the 1994 Super Famicom game of the same name, 'Super Punch-Out!!', which is a remake of the arcade game (certainly for the ten years anniversary).


The game's title music, is actually the 'Gillette Look Sharp March'. This jingle, originally heard in Gillette radio and television commercials, was later used as the theme song to the Gillette Cavalcade of Sports, which aired boxing matches. The music can also be heard in the 1980 boxing related film 'Raging Bull' during the scene where Jake LaMotta (as played by Robert De Niro) unveils his new nightclub.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Power-up items :

1) Evol : evolution item. Power-up your ship.

2) BEvol : black evolution item, released by the big ships. Also powers-up your ship. It can be changed to an Evol item by shooting at it.

3) Ar : armour item. It is released by some enemies. Unlike the evolution items, it moves upwards.

4) Sp : speedup item. It is released by some enemies. Unlike the evolution items, it moves upwards.

5) DNA : it is released by the ground lizards.

6) Egg : available after destroying each stage boss. It adds a second ship that shoots sideways and can also be upgraded by collecting evolution items. Its evolution level is at most equal to the main ship level.


* General sequence : 

1) When you are not invincible -> (get hit by a bullet) -> PISTER 

2) All states -> (fixed time without collecting power-up) -> degenerate 

3) PISTER -> (get hit by a bullet) -> die 

4) All states -> (get hit by an enemy) -> die 


* Evolution sequence (when you collect an evolution item) : 

PISTER -> HODOYODO (your stating level) -> ZWIPIP -> DARIER -> SYULBA -> QUILL -> LBOCK -> SWEEP -> DLIME -> ARTDEAME -> SLUGBU -> GYASYALBA

(if you collect BEVol while you are DARIER, ZWIPIP or ARTDEAME then the evolution sequence is different, see below)


* Degeneration sequence (at fixed time without collecting an evolution item) : 

1) GYASYALBA -> SLUGBU -> ARTDEAME -> DLIME -> SWEEP -> LBOCK -> QUILL -> SYULBA -> DARIER -> ZWIPIP -> HODOYODO

2) FC FDIVI -> FOUR DIVI -> TC TDIVI -> TWO DIVI -> ARTDEAME -> DLIME -> SWEEP -> LBOCK -> QUILL -> SYULBA -> DARIER -> ZWIPIP -> HODOYODO

3) DARIER-4S -> DARIER-4 -> DARIER-3 -> DARIER-2 -> DARIER -> ZWIPIP -> HODOYODO

4) PISPIDER -> PISTER

5) GOAT DEAM -> PISTER

6) PISNAKE -> PISTER


* Mutation sequence : 

1) All levels -> (hit the orange explosions released by the ground bugs) -> PISPIDER (bullet invincible)

2) ARTDEAME -> (collect BEvol) -> TWO DIVI -> TC TDIVI -> FOUR DIVI -> FC FDIVI


* Opposite evolution : 

1) SLUGBU -> (degenerate) -> GYASYALBA (but shooting like ARTDEAME) -> (get hit by a bullet) -> GOAT DEAM (bullet invincible)

2) All levels, except PISTER and the invincible levels -> (destroy some water snakes) -> (get hit by a bullet) -> PISNAKE (bullet invincible)


* Bomb upgrade :

1) DARIER -> (collect BEvol) -> DARIER-2 -> DARIER-3 -> DARIER-4 -> DARIER-4S (bomb upgrade)

2) ZWIPIP -> (collect BEvol) -> ZWIPIP-2 -> DARIER-4 -> DARIER-4S (bomb upgrade)


* Bug? feature? : Under the attract mode the ship can me moved by the player as long that screen persists. It can fire both shots. Only in the Japanese version of the game.

Super Space Invaders '91 (c) 1990 Taito.


The third sequel to Taito's seminal "Space Invaders", Super Space Invaders '91 leaves the classic Invaders game-play intact, but adds a slew of new alien invaders and power-ups to the mix. This, together with the vastly improved graphics that introduce colorful new backdrops - some of which scroll vertically in a similar fashion to the star-field in Namco's "Galaxian" - ensure that SSI 91 is a worthy sequel to the legendary original.


The original game's flying saucer still makes an appearance, but instead of merely awarding bonus points when shot - as in the original game - it now drops a power-up pod for the player to retrieve. Power-ups include shield, faster shots, a laser (activated with the second button) and a giant butterfly, which freezes the invaders for a limited time.


One of the game's most memorable features was the 'Cattle Mutilation' bonus screen, in which the player must protect a heard of cattle from a number of fast-moving saucers, intent on stealing the animals. If a cow is snatched; the player must shoot the relevant saucer to free it; being careful not to actually shoot the cow itself. The '91 incarnation also introduced 'bosses' to the series for the first time; giant, screen-filling aliens that required several shots to kill.


Another major difference to the previous games in the series is that if an invader reaches the bottom of the screen, the player will simply lose a ship (in the original, the game would end once an alien had landed). Also, the player's ship now comes equipped with a shield that can withstand several hits. The shield's strength is depleted every time it takes a direct hit from one of the invaders, and too many hits will result in the shield disappearing altogether. A direct hit on an un-shielded ship will result in the loss of a player life.

Super Sprint (c) 1986 Atari Games.


Like "Championship Sprint", released the same year, Super Sprint is an updated version of the old Atari Sprint series; with added the ability to allow players to upgrade their vehicles as the game progresses. Upgrades are won by collecting wrenches that appear once per track. After a player has collected four wrenches, they will be presented with an upgrade screen; giving them the opportunity to choose better traction, increased top speed, faster acceleration, or a faster helicopter. The only discernable difference between this and "Championship Sprint" is the addition of brand new tracks.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Thunder Serve : Hold the Up/Left Diagonal before pressing the serve button, and before hitting the ball hold the Down/Left Diagonal when the ball becomes red and press the button. This serve does an ace anytime except in the last two games, but you can also do it. You must press the button a bit before the ball becomes red, and you'll make an ace on the last line on the ground. The ball looks like a missile shot from the air.


* Phantom Serve : Hold the Up/Right Diagonal before pressing the serve button, and before hitting the ball hold the Down/Right Diagonal and when the ball becomes red press the button. This serve does an ace always except with the last two games. The ball splits in three phantom balls.


* Towering Serve : Hold Up before serving and hit the ball a bit before the ball becomes red. The ball leaves the screen and you don't know where it falls down.

Super Xevious (c) 1984 Namco.


The player pilots a combat aircraft called a 'Solvalou' which is armed with a forward-firing gun for aerial targets, and bombs for destroying ground-based targets. A red targeting square is situated in front of the Solvalou, which allows the player to aim their bombs accurately. The enemy craft appears in a number of different guises; from the standard variety that arrive in large numbers but shoot slow-moving projectiles, to exploding black spheres that shoot projectiles at high speed. There are also rotating shields that cannot be destroyed and must be carefully avoided. Ground enemies are a combination of both stationary bases and moving vehicles, most of which fire slow-moving projectiles. A gigantic, floating fortress (called 'Andor Genesis') appears in certain areas; this is defeated by knocking out its core.


Super Xevious is actually divided into sixteen different areas, which are separated by an area of forest. If a player dies before less than 70% of an area has been completed, play restarts at the beginning of the same area; should a life be lost AFTER 70% of an area has been completed, however, play restarts at the beginning of the next area. After area sixteen has been completed, the game loops back to area seven.

- TRIVIA -


Super Xevious is not a sequel of "Xevious", this is an update! It uses the exact same graphics and background image as "Xevious".


Namco released a boardgame based on this game (same name) in 1985 (in Japan only) : Flying your ship about the levels (rolling the dice to move). Battle enemies on the ground by rolling dice, battle ones in the air via card combat. Build up your shields and power up your blaster as you progress through the levels. Each 'level' is a different board, and there's 7 levels (boards) in all. Cute little spaceships for your pieces.


- UPDATES -


The differences from "Xevious" are :

* Several new characters appear in the game including a silver-grey Galaxian flagships, a large jet, a small jet, a helicopter and a small tank. The Galaxians can be shot like any other enemy. The large jet which flies down cannot be shot or collide with the player ship and doesn't have any obvious purpose. The small jet, helicopter and tank (all of which are tan colored) can be picked up for bonus points but if shot will reset the score to zero !

* Gameplay is a bit more difficult.

* The hidden Sol Citadels are in different locations.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Secret message : the designer of "Xevious" has included a trick for generating his name right at the beginning of the game. As soon as Solvalou appears, move to the far right edge of the screen and begin bombing constantly. Continue bombing until the first set of attacking rings is very close to you and then shoot the rings. The message 'Special thanks for you by game designer Evezoo.' will appear on the screen.

Super Zaxxon (c) 1982 Sega.


SUPER ZAXXON is a 1- or 2-player video game that presents the player with tremendous challenge and excitement never before experienced. The 3-dimensional-like, isometric graphics are produced by projecting the picture at a slant on the screen, putting the player in remote controlled realism with his SUPER ZAXXON player ship.


The player ship climbs, dives and strafes to maneuver through the many obstacles it encounters in its flight. In unique game play action, the player ship appears larger or smaller depending on its altitude, casts trailing shadow that follows it just as a real shadow would. This shadow, an altimeter on the video screen, and the points of impact of the player's gunfire, help judge the altitude of the player's space craft, lending new skill and challenge to SUPER ZAXXON.


Flying at supersonic speeds, the player confronts an ominous floating munitions fortress.  Here the player ship must battle hidden ground-to-air missiles, rotating gun turrets, tracking parabolic antennas and electrifying maser barriers as he banks, climbs and dives to strafe enemy installations and fuel tanks, gaining valuable points towards ships and extra fuel.


Once through the fortress, SUPER ZAXXON lures the player ship into a foreboding tunnel where the player must use cautious skill and a responsive extra-heavy duty fighter pilot control stick to overcome the limited ceiling in the tunnel and dodge or destroy a terrific onslaught of flying minelayers, enemy ships and self-destructing robot spaceships, yet also avoid the indestructible mines that crowd the dim corridor.


Accompanied by the roar of space wind, the player soars out of the tunnel to face another battle within the enemy headquarters. This is a more heavily defended floating fortress of tighter passageways armed with maser barriers and increasingly heavier firepower from enemy defenses. Overcoming all this, the player is ready to face the ultimate challenge within the enemy headquarters-a bigger-than-life, fire breathing Dragon who can destroy the player ship with a single breath of fire. With an unnerving wail, the fierce Dragon flies forward and unleashes a breath of flame from its huge mouth. But by firing six direct hits on the Dragon's mouth, the player can defeat the Dragon. The game ends with the loss of the last player ship.

- TRIVIA -


After the release of "Zaxxon", Sega realized it had a hit on its hands. The unique nature of the game featuring its three-quarter perspective was one of the first (if not the first) games to add depth and some feeling of perspective to a space game. Sega was quick to follow up on this success with Super Zaxxon.


Released in November 1982.


Super Zaxxon built on the Zaxxon model by creating a more challenging game. Although Super Zaxxon didn't do as well as its predecessor, it still created a respectable niche as far as arcade games went.  Sega went on to produce other games such as "Star Trek", "Buck Rogers", "Pengo", and "Tac/Scan" to name a few.


Differences Between Super Zaxxon and "Zaxxon" : Although both games look the roughly the same in design, this is where the similarities end. Super Zaxxon was made to be a more challenging game. It achieves this by the following differences :

* Your fighter moves much faster. This makes going after ground targets a big challenge.

* The graphics are different. Although this is more of a viewing difference, it can still change ones perspective after they have gotten used to the Zaxxon graphics.

* There is no more outer space battle. Instead, you must go through a narrow tunnel to get to area 3.

* Instead of 20 fighters, you now have to tangle with 25 fighters in area 2.

* A new enemy, the Mine Layer, is introduced. As the name implies, this ship lays mines in your path.  You can destroy the mines but it takes a few hits.

* Instead of encountering one Zaxxon robot, you now have to deal with three Super Zaxxon, dragon looking robots.

* The placement of things (fuel tanks, gun implacements, etc.) in areas 1 and 3 is different then in Zaxxon.

* There are now indestructible, elevated guns in area 1. These guns sit on the right side and they are 2.5 units in altitude.


- SCORING -


Scoring is pretty straight forward in this game. Some variable scoring does exist for a couple of things.


Gun Implacements (Green and Gray) : 200 or 500 points (random)

Fuel Tank : 500 points

Radar Tower : 1000 points

Missile (Ground-to-Air) : 300 points

Missile (Air-to-Air) : 200 points

Fighters (on runway) : 100 points

Fighters (in air) : 200 points + (50 points/level after level 1)

Mine Layer : 200 points + (50 points/level after level 1)

Mines : 200 points + (50 points/level after level 1)


Super Zaxxon (destroyed (all colors)) : 2000 points

Super Zaxxon (not destroyed (all colors)) : 500 points

Destroying all planes in the tunnel : 2000 points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


When you start the game, your fighter will be in the middle at the bottom of the screen. You will see an asteroid with a wall rising from it. You will then see an opening in the wall. This is how you will enter areas 1 and 3.


AREA 1 : This area is basically ground targets. You may have to increase altitude to get over the short barriers but this is basically a ground attack area.

a) The action starts immediately as soon as you go through the opening in the wall. Drop your altitude immediately to not only to avoid the Air-to-Air missile, but to take out ground targets.

b) Fuel is a precious commodity. You must destroy the Fuel Tanks in order to increase the amount of fuel in your fighter. This won't be an easy matter, many of the Fuel Tanks are covered either by Gun Implacements, Ground-to-Air missiles, or both.

c) When you are flying along the ground to destroy targets, watch out for the Gun Implacements and missile silos. Both will fire upon your fighter at every opportunity. The missile silos will usually launch Ground-to-Air missiles as soon as your fighter is over them. Gun Implacements only fire when you are at ground level.

d) As soon as you 'hop' over the short barriers, get down to ground level again to do more destruction. Try to hit the Radar Towers since they yield the biggest points at this point.

e) When you get to the airfields, try to destroy as many fighters as you can (you can destroy a maximum of five). The more fighters on the ground you destroy equates to that many less you have to encounter in area 2. This also means you have a better chance at the 2,000 point bonus.

f) Speaking of the airfields, watch out since there are many hidden missile silos within them. Keep moving around or you may be surprised by a Ground-to-Air missile.

g) Do not fly at maximum altitude if you can help it. If you fly too long at maximum altitude, your fighter will be met head-on by an Air-to-Air missile which is very difficult to destroy (takes six shots).


AREA 2 : This is one of harder areas of the game. You will be entering a narrow tunnel where your maximum altitude is only one unit. In addition, there is very little maneuvering room.

a) You will be attacked by both enemy fighters and enemy mine layers.

b) Since there isn't much altitude within the tunnel itself, it should be easy to pick off enemy air units. The problem that arises, though, is the concentration of said air units.

c) Be very wary of the mine layers. They swing from side-to-side within the tunnel and have a bad habit of dropping a mine right in your flight path. Six shots destroy a mine but it is usually placed so quickly, you don't have a chance to shoot it.

d) Enemy air units only come at you from the front. They don't return from the back for more action.

e) The enemy fighters will usually make three to four passes at you before you are out of this area.


AREA 3 : This is the area that gives players the most trouble. Due to the small openings in the walls plus those openings being at different heights can really test a player's skill. In addition, you must still take out Fuel Tanks in order to keep flying.

a) In order to make sure that you will be able to pass through an opening, continue to fire your gun.  If your laser fire doesn't go through, that means you have to quickly adjust either your altitude or left/right orientation.

b) The barriers are relatively close together which means you have to get through one and quickly adjust to where the next one is. Over a period of time, you will memorize where the openings in the barriers are and make your trip that much easier.

c) Many of the targets such as Fuel Tanks and Radar Towers are just on the other side of the walls. This means you have to drop and go left or right very quickly to have a chance of hitting them.

d) An added bonus of firing through the barriers (especially the ones at ground level) is that you can knock off the targets on the other side of said barrier making your life that much easier.

e) After the last barrier, you get to tangle with the Super Zaxxon's. To them every time :

1) Set your altitude to one and one-half units.

2) Go to the middle side of the screen.

3) When he starts to enter, start firing. Adjust your fire so that you are hitting the area where the mouth of the Super Zaxxon is.

4) You need to get six shots into his mouth before he throws a fireball at your fighter.

5) Once you have either destroyed, or forced the blue Super Zaxxon to retreat, you have to deal with the green Super Zaxxon.

6) Once you have either destroyed, or forced the green Super Zaxxon to  retreat, you have to deal with the red Super Zaxxon.

7) After you have either destroyed, or forced the red Super Zaxxon to retreat, you go back to area 1 again.

8) As a reward for killing off the Super Zaxxons, you get 2000 points apiece for them.


Once you complete Area 3, the cycle begins anew.

Considered as a hack of "Galaxian", this game seems more like a hack of "Moon Alien Part 2" by Nichibutsu, but with the graphics changed to look more like "Galaxian". This explains why the shots move with the ship and why the fuel gauge is there. On Moon Alien the shots move left/right but there is no fuel gauge. Galaxian also didn't use a 'title screen' formed with graphics, it went straight through to 'We are the Galaxians'.

Tac/Scan (c) 1982 Sega.


TAC/SCAN is a 1 or 2-player alternate action game, displayed via SEGA's Color X-Y video system. Commanding unprecedented firepower, the player maneuvers seven fighter ships in a squadron formation. All seven ships fire at once when the FIRE button is pressed, producing a spectacular missile salvo.


The object of the game is to accumulate points by destroying incoming enemy ships while dodging fireballs launched by these enemies. TAC/SCAN presents the space battle from two entirely different perspective views in the course of the game, with visually exciting transition sequences interconnecting the two views.


The player begins the game with a seven ship formation, and a supply of reserve ships which are shown above the player score on the screen. The number of reserve ships at the beginning of the game is switch selectable. An ADD SHIP button placed next to the FIRE button transfers one of the reserve ships in the squadron formation. Where the reserve ships are placed is shown by a half-intensity fighter in the formation. This 'add ship' position continuously cycles between the empty squadron positions, and the advanced player will time the ADD SHIP function to place squadron fighters at preferred positions.


A player fighter is blown up by contact with either an enemy ship or an enemy fireball. Whenever all seven ship positions become empty the game is over, EVEN IF THERE ARE REMAINING RESERVE FIGHTERS shown above the player score. Thus the player must continuously judge when to add reserve fighters by using the ADD SHIP button. Add them too early, and they might be depleted too fast; use them too late and you risk ending the game with reserve fighters left over.


There is an additional way to add ships to the squadron. During the course of the action, player fighter ships enter the playfield and intermix with the enemy ships. The player can capture these fighters directly into the seven ship formation by steering them into empty fighter positions. The player's missile fire DOES NOT blow up friendly fighters--only enemy ships.


TAC/SCAN begins with a top view of the battle. For the first ten seconds the player shoots at enemy ships without having to worry about return fire. After this 'warm-up' period, game play escalates dramatically. During this first phase, a different type of enemy appears just after two of the player fighters fly onto the screen. This is the Stinger, which flits around the field and shoots a deadly laser. This ship is a high priority target, since if not dealt with, it will pick off all of the squadron ships and end the game.


When the player attempts to dock a friendly fighter into the squadron formation, he or she has the choice of any of the empty ship positions shown in the squadron. A special feature occurs when the player ship docks into the frontmost ship position (marked with a red 'cursor'). Thin causes the squadron formation to regroup into a different pattern. If the load position is occupied, a fighter is added to the reserve count above the player's score.


At the end of the first phase (the top view) the squadron ships regroup, and a dramatic transition sequence takes the player into phase two. This sequence consists of the fighters rising and enlarging in size, then turning INTO the screen, lighting afterburners, and proceeding to fly forward to continue the battle. The enemy ships now appear far off in the distance, and grow in size as they approach the player's squadron. The player is given chances to rendezvous with friendly fighters, as in phase one.


At the end of this second phase, a space tunnel appears on the screen, and the player uses the rotary control to steer the squadron formation through the tunnel. Any fighter which hits a side wall of the tunnel explodes on contact. A triangular guide is shown during this sequence to show the player where his triangular ship formation should be. If the player keeps the formation centered within the guide, no ships will be lost.


Once out of the space tunnel, the player resumes with the second round. This is a more difficult top view battle, as at the beginning of the game. TAC/SCAN proceeds with multiple two phase rounds (phase one is the top view, phase two is the rear view) until all squadron ships are lost.


A switch option allows bonus reserve chips to he added with certain score values. The factory set option is to add one reserve ship every 30,000 points.


Regardless of the number of squadron ships on the screen, there are always seven missiles at a time available to the player. If there are seven ships on the screen (a full squadron), pressing the FIRE button launches all seven at once. Another push of the FIRE button cancels the seven in flight and launches seven new ones. If the squadron is not full, the seven missiles can be independently targeted. For example, with a single ship, seven missiles can be fired in seven directions, and only when the eighth is shot is the first one terminated (if it is still on the screen).


The 2-player game is played with players alternating after successful negotiation of the space tunnel. Whenever a player is eliminated, the other player continues and finishes the game.

Released during November 1982.

- SCORING -


Rounds 1 through 7 :

Enemy ships : 100 points X round number.

Stingers : 1,000 points X round number.


Rounds 8 and above :

Enemy ships : 800 points.

Stingers : 8,000 points. 


Destroying 2 enemy ships with a single missile salvo doubles the point values.


Destroying 3 enemy ships with a single missile salvo triples the point values.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* The most effective strategy for extending your playing time in Tac/Scan is to add as many extra ships as possible to your reserve (listed in upper-left corner of screen). Ships must be caught by the leading ship position which is further signified by a red colored underline in order to be added to your reserve. To begin capturing ships you must have at least one open position in your fleet; otherwise the game will not award ships (kill off 2 of your ships on the edges of your fleet at the very beginning of the game to achieve the highest amount of reserve ships during the first wave).


* Wave one in Tac-Scan should always be played with a minimum of two ships in your fleet, with additional ships added as the levels get faster and harder. The second and third wave can almost always be effectively played with only two ships, and it is very important not to waste reserve ships in these two waves (saving those ships for the more dangerous first wave).


* Always keep changing directions on both wave 1 and 2. It is very effective to destroy ships while turning on wave 1, and on wave 2 ships will have a hard time hitting you if you don't stay in the same position for very long.


* The faster you fire, the shorter your shots will travel. Allowing a short pause between shots will allow them to travel the distance of the screen.

- TRIVIA -


Released in December 1983.


There were 2 other versions of Tapper: "Root Beer" (01/1984) and "Suntory" (Japan, Game ID : 834-5385 / 834-5387). The Suntory version was a Sega board, Suntory is a Japanese beer (see "Updates" section for more information).


The main character in the game (as well as the main character of two other Bally Midway games; "Domino Man", and "Timber") is based on a Marvin Glass employee called Mike Ferris, who had the same distinctive mustache and bald head and reputedly wore a red T-shirt all of the time.


The music for the third stage (the punk bar) was loosely inspired by new wave music group Devo's song 'Workin' in the Coal Mine'.


Tapper was play tested in a Chicago-area Rush Streetbar called 'The Snuggery' and received much positive feedback from the bar's patrons. Digitized belches were originally going to be used in the game, but, perhaps thankfully, they never made it into the final version.


The cabinet is designed to resemble a real bar - replete with a brass foot rail and two brass drink or ashtray holders (one on each side of the control panel). The cabinet and gameplay on the beer version features the Budweiser logo. The pour spouts have mock-up Budweiser handles that closely resemble the Budweiser taps that appear in real bars throughout the world.


Approximately 3300 Tapper uprights were made and around the first 100 or so were released with colour side art. About 300 cocktail machines were also made.


- UPDATES -


* Root Beer version is almost identical to the Budweiser version, except the player is a soda jerk serving non-alcoholic root beer.


* Suntory version has different graphics and most likely different music.


- SCORING -


Serving a cowboy/girl patron with beer : 50 points.

Serving a sports bar patron with beer : 75 points.

Serving a punk patron with beer : 100 points.

Serving an alien patron with beer : 150 points.

Collecting an empty beer glass : 100 points.

Collecting a tip left on the bar : 1,500 points.

Guessing the correct can on the bonus screen : 3,000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Easter Egg : In the attract mode, wait until the word Tapper is filling up with beer, and hold down the joystick, both taps, and the player 1 & 2 buttons. You will then see the names of the game designers.


* Take your time in the first few levels. You can make a high score by leaving one person and waiting for more people.


* The last guy in the row will almost always leave a tip.


* If a person leaves the bar in the first level you get 50 points but, if you let them get close to the end of the bar, they will drink the beer and stay. It's 100 for getting the empty mug.


* The longer you stay in the level, the faster the people and mugs move.

Targ (c) 1980 Exidy.


Targ is a 1 or 2-player shooter game released by Exidy in 1980. Your town is invaded by Targ riders, you must manouvre the heroic vehicle Whummel to destroy them. From time to time, a Spectar comes into screen, and can be destroyed for extra bonus.


Action takes place into a 9x9 grid, 'Crystal City', where the player's vehicle must avoid and chase down 10 enemy wedge-shaped vehicles. When all enemies are destroyed, you are awarded an extra bonus and can access the following level. 2 players can alternate in the game. You use a 4-way joystick to control the Whummel, and a pushbutton to fire at enemies. Progressing in the gameplay causes the Targs to become faster and smarter, for a fast and furious gameplay.

- TRIVIA -


Released in June 1980.


Targ was the first 'fantasy theme' game.


While in that period many western companies licensed games from Japanese developers (Exidy itself licensed Nintendo's "Sheriff" as "Bandido"), Targ is one of the few western games that made it in the opposite way, being licensed by Sega for Japanese distribution.


Targ stands for 'Target'. 'Spectar' stands for 'Special Target'.


- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is pretty easy although it is done a bit differently. You will be given the score value of a Targ Ramship at the beginning of each level. This is how you can figure out which level you are currently on.

Targ Ramship : 10 points x level

Spectar Smuggler : 100-900 points (by 100's)


You also get a bonus for completing a level. The bonus is 1000 points x level number.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


When you start the game, your Wummel will be in the bottom right corner of the screen. There will be 10 Targ Ramships at the top of the 10 vertical lanes.


* Learn how your Wummel operates. You can go pretty fast in one direction. To turn around, though, takes a little time since you have to slow down before you turn around. You can use this deceleration, though, to your advantage to trap enemy units and sometimes get multiple kills.


* You can only have one missile on the screen at any one time. Plan your shots accordingly. In addition, you can only fire forward.


* All enemies on the screen will avoid trying to be in front of your Wummel. That means you must quickly get in front or behind them so they don't veer off to avoid your fire. This means you may have to plan a few ambushes to take out the enemies.


* All the enemies (Targ Ramships and Spectral Smugglers) only move at full speed. This can work to your advantage since if they are coming at you, you can decelerate your Wummel and pick them off.


* If you must turn around quickly, the easiest (and best) way to achieve this is to go around the blocks.  Three right turns can turn you from the hunted into the hunter. In addition, this is great for setting up ambushes and taking out the enemy ships quickly.


* Try to isolate enemy ships. If you try to take on a ''pack'' of them, you will lose since there are so many different directions that the enemy ships can come from.


* During the first three levels, you have enough speed to avoid your attackers. This changes on level four and beyond as the enemy ships can easily outrun your Wummel. This means you will need to make very quick turns in order to get behind them.


* Also, if you take too long on a level, the enemy ships will speed up to make quick work of your Wummel.


* As you progress through the levels, the enemy ships will get ''smarter'' and attempt to corner your Wummel. Your safest action is to avoid being trapped while picking off individual enemy ships to even the odds.


* Nifty little trivia note : The game screen is an optical illusion. If you stare at the yellow boxes, you will see yellow circles form at the intersections. Nothing that affects game play but still interesting.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* On screens where the enemies move consistently pick them all off in batches when they appear. You will then have a few seconds of clear time in which to shoot more hoppers before more enemies re-appear.


* In the caterpillar room, stay away from the edge of the screen as the enemies only move there. Once one complete a full circuit of the room, it will mutate into a butterfly which quickly homes in on you. Try not to let them complete a circuit.


* If you are about to be crushed by the walls, use a smart bomb as they are easier to obtain than extra lives. It's worth the price to save a life.


* In the bonus room, run over the higher numbers first, especially those to the left and right edges as they are quickly swallowed up by the moving walls.


* It's better to shoot the last little hopper near the top or bottom of the screen, as you then have some extra time in which to pick off a few more enemies before the walls close.


* The enemies appear opposite to your position. For example if you are at the bottom of the screen, they will appear at the top and move towards you.


* Try only to use smart bombs when the maximum number of enemies are on screen to maximise their effect and your points for doing so.

Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles (c) 1989 Konami.


The British incarnation of "Teenage Mutant NINJA Turtles" (see TRIVIA for more info regarding the name change) in which between one and four players play as either Leonardo (blue, katana blades); Raphael (red, sais); Michaelangelo (orange, nunchakas); or Donatello (purple, bo staff) as the infamous turtles fight against the might of Shredder's army to rescue April O'Neil and Splinter; before a final confrontation with their arch-enemies Krang and The Shredder. Turtles was a superb use of its license and perfectly captured the spirit of both the comic-book and cartoon series upon which it was based. New players could join the game at any time.

- TRIVIA -


Released in October 1989.


The UK title for this game (as well as both the comics and cartoon series), "Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles", replaced the original 'ninja' of the title with the less threatening 'Hero'. This is because the Conservative British government of the time wouldn't allow ANY 'children's product' to include the word 'ninja' at any point during its content, arguing that to do so would encourage the children of this fine country to use violence against each other.


This game is known in Japan as "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Super Kame Ninja".


The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984 and published by Mirage Studios. The whole idea for the comic book (which was originally published in Black and White) came from the nickname 'Ninja Turtle' that one of the creators had when they were young.

In 1987, Playmates Toys bought the rights of the characters to produce a line of Action Figures. That same year Playmates made a TV adaptation of the story for a 5-episode mini series which became a huge success. Two years later, the series went on full production and was aired on CBS stations from 1989 to 1996 (with brief hiatus in 1993-1994).

The success of this 'Humanoid Action Animal' concept spawned (or shed some light on) many other comics, toys and TV shows such as Bucky O'Hare, Swat Kats, C.O.W. Boys of Moo Mesa, Street Sharks, Biker Mice from Mars among others; most of them became complete blunders.


The first names of turtles; Michaelangelo, Raphael, Leonardo, and Donatello, are the names of Italian Renaissance artists who lived between 1386 and 1564. Three of those artists had full names which were respectively Michaelangelo Buonariti, Raphael Sanzio and Leonardo Da Vinci; but as for Donatello, that was his only name.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Various Sewer Level Tricks :

1) When fighting in the sewer level, move your character as close as you can to the edge of the stone floor without falling to the water. If done correctly, no enemy in this level including the boss can touch you here as long as you remain on the floor's edge!

2) Stand just below the ledge in the middle of the screen. Then jump straight up. You will land just on the edge of the upper level. Nothing can hurt you for the rest of that level, but you can kill anything that comes close enough to you (You can't move up or down though, or you'll have to repeat this trick).

3) You can keep from getting hit by walking right along the edge of the brick floor. This prevents enemies from attacking you from multiple directions. You still need to nail enemies directly in front of you or behind you. This is easy with Donatello.


* You can theoretically get unlimited points. Use the yellow guy's boomerang. Lead one yellow guy in such a way that he gets stuck at an object (fire hydrant or barrel) between you and him, aligned horizontally. He will try to move toward you, but he won't be able to move since the object is near him. Get close enough to him so that he starts throwing boomerangs. You can kill each one for (wow!) 1 point.


* Killing most bosses consist of 3 strategies : They all consist of moving vertically towards the bosses.

1) Move vertically upwards, hit the boss, and move vertically downwards. Repeat until dead. Works well on Bebop.

2) Wait for the boss to move vertically down towards you, wait for him, hit him, and move vertically upwards. Repeat until he's dead. Works best on Rocksteady. Best results occur when you hit and run at the same time.

3) Wait for the boss to move vertically towards you. Jump over him, move through him and attack as you do this, keep moving. Repeat. Works well on the big robots.

After the first series was cancelled other shows based on these characters appeared, such as, Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation (Saban Productions, Live Action), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and TMNT Fast-Forward. However, the 1980's craze never took off again.


Konami hit the jackpot with this game. It was so successful that Konami went on a license-acquiring craze. They got the rights to many American (and some European) TV shows and Comic Books for home and arcade videogames with a quality so good that sometimes shadowed the original work.


This game is mainly based in the first 5 episode mini-series. However, it contains some references to the original comic book. The opening scene is a mix between a scene in the TV show in which a building is raided by the TMNT to find for the first time the Technodrome and a scene of the comic book in which Shredder sets fire to April's building when he finds she's harboring the turtles (that scene was also taken for the movie). At the Parking Lot scene, there is a van that has the logo of TCRI. TCRI (or TGRI in the movie) was the company responsible for the mutagen; in the TV show, it was Shredder's invention.


The first names of turtles; Michaelangelo, Raphael, Leonardo, and Donatello, are the names of Italian Renaissance artists who lived between 1386 and 1564. Three of those artists had full names which were respectively Michaelangelo Buonariti, Raphael Sanzio and Leonardo Da Vinci; but as for Donatello, that was his only name.


There were several distinct versions of this game available in the arcade, but the 4-player dedicated cabinet was the most common by far. There were also 2-player versions, but they are much harder to come by. The TMNT dedicated cabinet was fairly large and had an over-sized control panel (to accommodate four players). The sides were decorated with full side-art showing April O'Neal and several of the turtles in a city scene. The marquee shows a city scene with all the turtles and a live action version of April O'Neal. Frankly they just should have drawn her instead of using a photograph, her hair is just awful. The control panel has a city scene similar to the one on the marquee and has four joysticks (one for each player), each of which is a different color. These machines all came equipped with 25'' open frame monitors, although you will sometimes run into one with a different size screen, these are almost always conversions of other titles. Moving on to the interior of the machine, the game itself runs on a JAMMA compatible circuit board. The board itself will plug into a JAMMA wiring harness, but it has a second harness to accommodate the controls for players three and four. The games "The Simpsons", "Sunset Riders", and "Bucky O'Hare" are fully compatible with this extended harness, and will plug directly into a TMNT cabinet without modification. One thing that you may notice is that the jump and attack buttons seem backwards of what they would logically be, but you get used to it quickly.


In the ending epilogue, Konami spell Dimension X : 'Dimention X'.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Turtles in Time (c) 1991 Konami.


The sequel to 1989's hugely successful original, 'Turtles in Time' once more sees the four heroes taking on Shredder and his army. Game-play remains similar to the original game, but the experience is enhanced further with the obligatory improved graphics and sound effects. 'Turtles in Time' also features a larger variety of levels, as now the battle between good and evil rages across time as the Turtles travel to prehistoric, pirate and Wild West times in their pursuit of the elusive Splinter.


Yet again, Konami's mastery of the genre was in evidence as the manic energy and humour of the cartoon and comic-book series upon which the game is based was captured perfectly.

- TRIVIA -


This is the only franchise of the so-called 'Ameri-comi Connection' series that had an arcade sequel.


Just like the previous game, it has references which don't come from the TV show in which is mainly based upon. The enemies at 'Skull & Crossbones', Rhazar and Tokka, are the two mutants that Shredder creates to destroy the TMNT in the second movie and the Super Shredder form at 'Technodrome: The Final Shell Shock' also comes from the movie when he tries the mutagen on himself.


This game is not based on the 3rd TMNT movie. In that movie the turtles travel in time only to the 1700's Japan. In this game, they don't even go to Japan.


Soundtrack Releases :

Konami All-Stars 1993 ~ Music Station of Dreams (KICA-9016~8) (12/24/1992)


The song that plays in the attract mode is known as 'Pizza Power' which is from the 'The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles : Coming Out of Our Shells Tour'. Here are the lyrics to Pizza Power :


Growing up in a glass bowl,

with chameleons, lizards, and tadpoles.

It hardly enters your mind, 

that there's something better than this.

A lettuce leaf or a carrot,

maybe a seed from a parrot.

Believe me when it gets you,

the word gourmet just don't exist.


(chorus)

For pizza power,

a flying saucer food delight.

Pizza power,

that power makes us feel all right.

* Secret music : After finishing a game, and provided you reach the top scores, you are given the chance to enter your name. Instead of writing your name, try one of the following :

1) Type the planner name : 'TOMI' (in this case 'TOM' will be displayed and the last letter 'I' acts like the END button) and you will be able to listen to the ending theme which only comes up after winning the final. This means, that if you win the final, you can listen to the winning theme TWICE! :)

2) Type the programmer name : 'MICH' (here 'MIC' will be displayed and the last letter 'H' acts like the END button) you will be able to listen to some other music which does not exist anywhere else in the game!

Tempest (c) 1981 Atari.


Tempest introduces additional new features :

* Skill-Step with 99 skill levels of play

* Operator-information display

* Demonstration mode with freeze


Skill-Step allows a player to start a game at the same level as was previously achieved (he must start the next game within 30 seconds), without having to start over at the beginning levels. Therefore, skillful players continue to be challenged while less experienced players try to master higher levels. The 99 skill levels of play include 16 different playfields and 6 different targets.


In the play mode, a player-controlled, yellow claw-like shooter moves around on a 3-D tubelike playfield. The shooter rotates on the end of the tube that is nearest to the player. Enemies land on the end of the tube that is farthest away from the player to climb toward and attack the shooter. The shooter fires down the tube at the approaching enemies. When a player kills all the enemies on a tube, he blasts through the tube, flies through space, lands on a new tubelike playfield, and fights the enemies on that playfield. A player scores points by shooting enemies and by blasting through the tube to a new level. The player loses a life when killed by the enemy. The game is over when all the player's lives are gone.


All action occurs on one of sixteen suspended tubelike playfields. The 3-D tube surfaces are viewed from the top, so the view of the first playfield (a circle) is like looking into a well. Each playfield is made of 16 rails which connect the nearest to the farthest rim. The playfield color changes every 16 levels : level 1 is blue, level 17-red, level 33-yellow, level 49-cyan, 65-invisible and 81-green.


In addition, other events cause playfield color variation. The shooter causes the 2 rails on which it sits to change color. Superzap causes the playfield to flash as enemies are zapped. Playfield rails flash rainbow colors when a player earns a bonus life. Pulsar enemies cause sections of the nearest rim to disappear, and during the pulse phase, adjacent rails to flash.


The player's shooter is controlled by rotating the control-panel knob. The shooter moves around on the nearest rim of the tubelike playfield. The ends of the shooter always touch two adjacent rails. The rails on which the shooter sit change color (yellow in levels 1-16) which gives a flashlight effect and helps the player see the enemies in his lane.


A player shoots by pressing the fire button : tap it for 1 or 2 shots or press it for all 8 shots. A shot is extinguished when it hits an enemy, after it passes the far rim or after it plows a certain distance into an enemy spike. A shot is renewed after it is extinguished so there may be a maximum of eight shots on the screen at one time.


A player may use two superzaps per level. A first superzap kills all enemies on the playfield at the time of firing. A second superzap randomly kills one enemy on the playfield. The superzap does not affect enemy shots, spikes or enemies not yet landed on the playfield. Superzap is recharged when the player blasts to a new level.

Tempest was an awesome arcade game that transported the player into abstract realms of space. Soaring into its second decade of life, Tempest is still the favorite of devotees who seek to become one with this adventure through hyperspace.


Tempest was the first game to use 'Color-Quadrascan' and 'Skill-Step', both features unique to Atari vector games. Tempest was originally a 3-D "Space Invaders" clone called 'Vortex', but was changed when the other engineers didn't come back to play the game. This was kind of a test for an Atari game; if the engineers kept coming back to play a new game, it was considered a hit.


The first prototype of the game had the shape wireframe spinning and the gunner remaining stationary, but that caused motion sickness after a period of time so it was changed around.


* The Creation of Tempest : Dave Theurer, who designed the game and wrote the software, said his original intention was to make a first-person perspective of the "Space Invaders" game, but he ended up doing something completely new and different.  Rich Adam : "Dave implemented a first-person "Space Invaders". Everybody played it but they didn't keep coming back. You could tell when you had something cool, the engineers kept coming back. This was good and bad because there were times when you wanted to work on your game and everybody would want to be playing it. But when he was doing the first-person "Space Invaders", Dave didn't run into this problem of everyone wanting to play the game... and he said to himself : 'Well, maybe this isn't working. What can I do?' Then I came in one day and all of a sudden he had this round tube with these things coming up it. I said, 'What the heck is that Dave?' He said, 'I don't know. Aliens from the center of the Earth? I don't know.' I think he said something about having had a dream about it. I said, 'How does it work?' He said, 'I don't know. They're coming up around the edge of this thing and you're trying to blow them away.' He just sort of started out with this concept and took it from there. I can see why he would say that Tempest was certainly his proudest achievement. He worked extremely hard on that. It's pure creation from his own brain.".


* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters : Although known for his hard work and for his ability to focus on and conquer exceedingly tough software problems, Dave Theurer looks back upon his days at Atari as having been fun and rewarding. Dave Theurer : "It was just so exciting working on these new games. All my life I loved explosions. When I went to college I was a chemistry major because I wanted to do something where I could make explosions. When I was a kid I had a chemistry set and I'd blow stuff up all the time. Eventually, you learn that you can't really do that in real life, so the next best thing is to do it on the screen, so here I was blowing stuff up on the screen. Simulating real life is fun too. It's almost like you can create your own universe. Well, you are creating your own universe. That's rewarding, to see something come alive.".

Playing games, both video and pinball, was a constant part of life for the engineers at Atari. Dan Pliskin : "In the morning, I used to go in and I'd make up a pot of Italian roast or French roast coffee and pour myself a big mug. Then I'd go and sit it on a pinball machine and drink coffee and play pinball until scores got up to, like, a couple hundred thousand. That would be my indication that I was sharp enough to go and design something.".


* Popular from the Start : Tempest was a game that immediately captivated people from the very start. Lyle Rains : "Like a number of these games that were very addictive, the Tempest controls were good enough to where once you learned how to manipulate them you could almost become one with the machine. That is, a good Tempest player gets to spin that knob and do the firing in the right time and get into sync with the machine or get into a rhythm. I don't know exactly what to call it, but you were so close to the action that part of you entered the experience. You forgot about what was going on around you and you were just there. And you could get very good at it. I think what people like is the ability to accomplish amazing things".


* The Great 25-Cent Escape : Not only did players often find a sense of welcome escape in the video games they played, but this was very much the intention of some of the great game designers. Dave Theurer : "I want to design it for a guy who's totally frazzled by his job and needs a way to temporarily escape. There's a certain class of games... where you just get into a trance when you're playing them. As long as you're in this trance you'll do fine.".


Tempest was available in 3 different dedicated cabinets. An upright, a cabaret, and a cocktail. The upright machine came in a nice arrow shaped cabinet that featured one long straight angled line from the top of the cabinet to the bottom of the control panel. This design makes it very easy to spot converted Tempest cabinets. The Tempest marquee had a whole bunch of glowing purple lines along with an evil looking crawly thing that looked like it was coming right at you. The sideart had kind of a spacey look to it, with a bunch of red lines radiating out from a central point that had monsters crawling out of it! The control panel had more spacey lines and holes graphics, along with an optical spinner and a pair of fire buttons. The cocktail version was a black square table with a woodgrain top. It had red lines and instructions underneath the glass, with player control panels on either side. For some reason the monitors on these were installed butted up against one side, instead of centered. Both the cocktail and the upright used a color X-Y monitor.


The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including TEMPEST.


A Tempest unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'Twilight Zone - The Movie', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Night of the Comet', in the 1986 movie 'Running Scared', in the 1986 movie 'Maximum Overdrive' (A cocktail cabinet) and in the 1987 movie 'Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown'.


A Tempest unit appears in the music video 'Subdivisions' by RUSH.


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".

Level 9 : 54000 points

Level 11 : 74000 points

Level 13 : 94000 points

Level 15 : 114000 points

Level 17 : 134000 points

Level 20 : 152000 points

Level 22 : 170000 points

Level 24 : 188000 points

Level 26 : 208000 points

Level 28 : 226000 points

Level 31 : 248000 points

Level 33 : 266000 points

Level 36 : 300000 points

Level 40 : 340000 points

Level 44 : 382000 points

Level 47 : 415000 points

Level 65 : 656000 points

Level 73 : 766000 points

Level 81 : 898000 points


At the beginning of the game, you can always start on levels 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. Whenever you complete a game, you have either ten seconds or until you press a key to continue a game. You can start a game at any bonus level below where you finished your last game.  Therefore you must end your previous game on level 12 or higher to start your next game on level 11.


If you fail to clear the starting level you have chosen, that level is not available for you in the next game, however all starting levels below it are available.  For instance, if you start a game on level 17 but do not finish, then your next game can start as high as level 15.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Hints : 

- Players should work their way up through the levels to become familiar with game play. Drop down a level if play is too difficult.

- Experienced players should start at highest level possible for maximum points.

- On a new playfield shoot at enemy dots at far rim.

- Shoot the flipper as soon as it starts to flip.

- Use long spikes to reclaim shots and kill enemies approaching you from adjacent lanes.

- Avoid shooting fuseball-tankers near the top since emerging fuseballs usually zip up to the top and kill you.

- Use Superzap right before last enemy reaches the top for a few extra points.


* 898,000 points bonus :

1) You must have the Revision 1 ROMs in your machine.

2) You must have your machine set to coins and not on free-play.

3) Start a game and play until you successfully clear the red V stage. Die.

4) Start a new game on the red V level and complete the stage to get a bonus taking your score to more than 160,000.

5) As soon as you get the bonus from clearing the red V level get the last two digits of your score to 46 (by shooting spikes). Die.

6) Wait! Wait for one cycle of the machine's attract mode - high score initials, TEMPEST attract, game demonstration, high score table.

7) Start a new game, spin the spinner to the right all the way up to level 1 of the green stages.

8) Complete the stage for a bonus of 898,000.


* These are cheats (They weren't cheats at all. They were intentionally programmed in as a security measure). They were removed in ROM 217 and 222 software revision 2. First, you must complete level 8 and get a score with the format XXYYZZ : XX must be greater than 16, YY between 29 and 60, ZZ is a code listed below...

00 - freeze screen

01 - access bookkeeping totals

05 - allows playing during attract mode

06 - 40 free credits

11 - 40 free credits

12 - 40 free credits

14 - credit sound without actual credit

15 - credit sound without actual credit

16 - 40 free credits

17 - 40 free credits

18 - 40 free credits

41 - switch last 2 digits of score

42 - increase score quickly

46 - demonstration mode - start at any level, up to level 81

50 - player moves by itself

51 - player moves by itself

60 - objects drift down

66 - objects drift right

67 - objects jump

68 - objects drift up

70 - objects drift up


After code '05' (play during attract mode) is activated, the following cheats become available...

Set the last two digits to 46 : Random-colored level with wrong enemies.

Set the last two digits to 48 : 255 extra lives.


* Here are some quick tips for anyone new to Tempest (note : Level colors mentioned below refer to the level's tunnel color) : 

1) Flippers first appear in Level 1 (blue circle), but don't start flipping until Level 2 (blue square). Flippers flip at a constant rate, so play the angles. You can kill flippers on the outer edge by shooting when they are in the spaces next to you (as they flip). The wider the angle, the more time you have to shoot. You can also move under them as they flip. Good practice is to play level 1 as long as possible without firing. On the open shapes, you will want to hang out on one end of the other (to avoid attacks from both directions). On closed shapes, pick a spot with good angles and good visibility. Often flipping back and forth between two spaces (playing the angles depending on which direction the flippers are attacking from) is all you have to do. 


2) Tankers first appear in Level 3 (blue plus). Regular tankers contain two flippers. Feel free to shoot them and their cargo with impunity. Fuseball tankers are VERY dangerous. Shoot them and get out of the way. Pulsar tankers are also very dangerous. Shoot them and stay where you are (the pulsars will appear to either side). You can differentiate between the types of tankers by looking closely at their centers. Fuseball and pulsar tankers have tiny pictures of their cargos in their centers. The ability to instantly differentiate between tanker types is probably the most important ability separating good Tempest players from great Tempest players. 


3) Spikers first appear in Level 4 (blue bowtie). Spikers are generally harmless (although they do shoot at you), and the spikes they lay down are very handy some times. You can hold the fire button down for continuous fire, but you only get a maximum of eight shots at a time. This is enough to fill half the tube, but not enough for a true continuous stream of shots. If you have lots of flippers coming after you, find a long spike to sit on top of. You can then hold down the fire button for a machine gun effect. As the spike gets eaten away, look for another one to switch to. Be careful of pulsars and fuseballs when you do this however. When you get to level 65 (black/invisible circle) try riding a full spike all the way down at the end of the round. Your descent rate and rate of fire are perfectly matched so that you can actually blast it away without being impaled all the way to the bottom. 


4) Fuseballs first appear in Level 11 (blue flat/bowling alley). Fuseballs ride the lines. The safest place to be is in the space NEXT to one. It looks like it will kill you, but the hit logic only tests the center of the fuseball. Fuseballs will only cross one space at a time before dropping back down (until the end of the round when they start chasing you). If you get stuck with one coming after you at the end of a round (usually on one of the open shapes), try the 'Hail Mary' move of spinning very quickly. You can actually jump over one or more spaces (and a fuseball!) if you spin fast enough. Watch out for fuseball tankers at higher levels that split into two fuseballs that will immediately try and jump on you. 


5) Pulsars first appear in Level 17 (red circle). Pulsars are only dangerous when they are pulsing. Listen to the low, periodic buzz sound. As you get used to it, you will find yourself adapting to this built-in rhythm. You can shoot them when they aren't pulsing or spin out of the way. Watch out for pulsar tankers at higher levels that split into 2 pulsars on either side of the tanker lane.


6) Dip Switch #2 (2nd from the back of the game) on the upper bank (at N13) controls demo mode. Demo mode lets you start (and practice) anywhere you like. It does not record scores, however. In normal play, the game will let you start close to where you left off. If you want to 'cheat', put the game into demo mode, spin up to where you want to start, start the game and hit the player one start button causing you to zoom down the tube and gain the bonus. Then die and flip the dip switch back to normal mode. Now you can start a real game at the same level and record your score at the end. If you do this often, wiring a front-mounted bypass to that dip switch will come in very handy. There is also a freeze game dip switch that is also handy in case the phone rings while you are playing.


7) Level 81 (green circle) is the highest starting level. Most expert Tempest players agree that green is actually easier than the black/invisible levels that precede it. It is a bit faster, but it restores one of the most valuable visual clues in the game - the tell tale break in the outer edge caused by a pulsar (which is missing in the black/invisible levels). After level 96 (green figure eight/infinity), you are back to the green circle (97) and green square (98). Level 99 is the highest recorded by the game and consists of a never ending supply of random green shapes. Every time you finish the round or loose a life, you will end up with a different shape. To achieve a world record score, you will spend MOST of your time playing level 99 over and over again. If you can keep your rate of loss to roughly one life per two rounds (at 20K bonus), you can theoretically play forever. Tempest isn't a very good marathon game, however, as it only lets you build up 5 lives max at any one time. A 30-second bladder break while playing level 99 will pretty much wipe you out.


8) The highest score recordable by the game is 999,999 (a horrible error on the part of the designers). Starting at 81, you get there pretty fast (mid way through the greens). With a bit of practice, you can end the game at exactly 999,999. Do that 3 times and no one will ever be able to beat your score on a single machine (w/o clearing the high score table).

Terra Cresta (c) 1985 Nichibutsu.


Terra Cresta is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set over a constantly scrolling landscape of islands and enemy installations. The player is under constant attack from enemy spaceship waves, ground-based guns and turrets, dinosaurs and three different mothercraft ships. 


The levels are littered with ground-based silos bearing numbers between 2 and 5. These can be shot to release a player ship component, which then attaches to the player's current ship, increasing both its size and firepower. Power-ups available are 2-Wide shot, 3-Rear Shot, 4-Front cannon and 5-Rear shield. 


Using the "Phoenix" button splits the ship parts into a formation for limited time, giving increased fire power. The number of parts acquired determines the formation. For example, if the player has picked up two ship parts then a triangle is formed, with the player's main ship at the rear of the formation, with additional two ship components positioned at the front edge of the triangle. 


When all four numbered parts have been collected, the player's ship transforms into a flaming Phoenix, and is indestructable for a limited time.

- TRIVIA -


Tetris is a CLASSIC; ranking with the likes of "Pac-Man", "Donkey Kong" and "Tempest"; and is still one of the most popular games today.


Inspired by a pentominoes game he had bought earlier, Alexey Pajitnov creates Tetris on an Electronica 60 in June 1985 at the Moscow Academy of Science's Computer Center. It is ported to the IBM PC by Vadim Gerasimov and starts spreading around Moscow. Pajitnov gets a small degree of fame for his program. Due to Soviet political structure at the time, the inventor, Alexey Pajitnov was not able to patent his game. This gave rise to many sundry Tetris clones for all manner of machines.


Here is the name of all tetrominos in Tetris (A tetromino is a geometric shape composed of four squares, connected orthogonally) :

* The 'I' (Also called 'Stick' or 'Straight') - Four blocks in a straight line.

* The 'Square' (Also called 'O', 'Package' or 'Block') - Four blocks in a 2x2 square.

* The 'T' - A row of three blocks with one added below the center.

* The 'L' - A row of three blocks with one added below the left side.

* The 'J' (Also called 'Inverted L' or 'Gamma') - A row of three blocks with one added below the right side (This piece is a reflection of 'L' but cannot be rotated into 'L').

* The 'S' - Bent trimino with block placed on outside of clockwise side.

* The 'Z' (Also called 'Inverted S') - Bent trimino with block added on outside of anticlockwise side (This piece is a reflection of 'S' but cannot be rotated into 'S').


Apart from being a fine game, Tetris is also a perfect mirror of the human condition. For a while the game is entertaining, and we seem to have mastered it and are having fun. Then, something goes wrong. A rash mistake, or an unfulfilled wish, and we're fighting to repair the damage, but we've been thrown off-balance, and the cancer is spreading. Blocks that were once orderly and harmonious are jumbled and filled with holes, and our cup is on the verge of running over. There's always a point at which we stop planning for the future, and realize that we don't have one - all we can do is cling to the present and concentrate, focus our minds on what it's like to be alive, to play the game, before it's all over. You were waiting for a four-by-one block that never came. Eventually we stare death in the face, and death will not spare us because we would warn the others to stay away and not play the game. Sometimes we resist to the bitter end, moving blocks left and right without thought or care, just to hang on, and sometimes we accept the inevitable and pull the blocks down to us, smiling inwardly at the great joke. The rest is silence. We admire the fox as it escapes from the hounds, but when the hunt is over we turn away, and go off and drink and be merry, and somewhere else someone or something is watching us as we watch the fox. But the fox knows it is being chased.


Tetris falls in the same class of tantalizing problems as the famous Traveling Salesman Problem or the Halting Problem. It's the intellectual challenge of coming up with heuristics to crack the game that make it so addictive.


A bootleg version was released by 'Video Games' in 1989 (See 'Updates' for more information).


- UPDATES -


The bootleg version (made by 'Video Games') shares a different 'Staff screen' (See Staff section for the original), here is the bootleg one :

Project leader : James Bond

Technician : Log Dreaming

Audio : Bill Cody


- SCORING -


Placing a piece : 0 to 500 points


Filling lines across :

Single : 50 points

Double : 150 points

Triple : 400 points

Quadruple 'tetris' : 900 points


Starting on round 4 : 20,000 points

Starting on round 7 : 40,000 points


The end of round bonus depends on how many incomplete lines the player has at the bottom of the well when the round ends :

0 lines : 2,100 points

2 lines : 1,710 points

3 lines : 1,530 points

4 lines : 1,360 points

5 lines : 1,200 points

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Autoshot : repeatedly press the FIRING button for a couple of seconds, then, hold the button.


* If you defeat the giant tank boss with only the default single shot weapon, you will get the lazer powerup. Lose your existing weapons by, carefully, allowing them to be hit by enemies; you must do this before the tank boss enters the screen. Note : Bomb strikes must not be used to defeat the tank boss, or the lazer powerup will not appear.


* By using your Bomb attack when the score reads 777,000-odd, a 7UP powerup will appear, giving you seven extra lives.

- UPDATES -

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* 10,000 Points Bonus : At the start of the game, count your shots until arriving at the first railroad. If you've counted every 16 shots (16, 32, 48, 64 ...), a little car should enter the screen on the right side. Destroy it with next shot to get a 10,000 points bonus. There are similar cars throughout the game, but making them appear is a mystery.


* A Second 10,000 Points Bonus : Near the beginning there is a 'school house' with a red drum on the top. If you hit the red drum enough times, you'll get a 10,000 points bonus.


* Second Chance : If you get shot soon after starting a new game, the game will often let you off and just fire a super bomb instead.


* Warp : Lose your first player without scoring any points (make sure the second chance super bomb doesn't hit anything). The game puts you forward to a railway where a car will appear that can be shot for 10,000 points.


* Hint : Blast everything. Civilian cars and houses, etc, all give 50 points each.

The main character in the game (as well as the bartender in "Tapper" and the main character in "Domino Man") is based on a Marvin Glass employee named Mike Ferris, who had a similar mustache and bald head, and apparently wore a red T-shirt for much of the time.


The original idea was to do a two-player, simultaneous, competitive game, but this was shelved. A beaver was originally programmed into the game to add some extra competition in cutting down trees but was also removed.

Time Pilot '84 - Further Into Unknown World (c) 1984 Konami.


- TECHNICAL -


This title was usually sold as a conversion kit. There were only a few hundred dedicated cabinets made. It used the Konami Standard harness, and required a vertical monitor. The marquee showed a yellow Time Pilot '84 logo on a red space background. The side-art consisted of a huge sticker that showed a complicated space scene. Side-art like that rarely holds up very well, so most machines will probably be missing it altogether. The control panel featured a single joystick with 2 fire buttons off to the right (along with START buttons and game instructions).

A Time Pilot '84 unit appears in the 1986 movie 'Maximum Overdrive'.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* On the first level, head directly to the right. After a couple of screens, you'll see an unusual 'V' formation of silver ships that resemble craft in "Time Pilot", heading up or down. This easy-to-kill formation gives you 8,000 points, a good start to the game.


* The biplane from the original "Time Pilot" also makes a cameo appearance in TP84. To find it, fly right to the water and harbor area. Then turn vertically up the screen. When the biplane appears (over water), hit it with a missile, and you are rewarded with a free player!

Time Pilot (c) 1982 Konami.


The player controls his plane with the 8 way joystick and shoots at the enemies using the Fire button. TIME PILOT consists of 5 different stages of play which are as follows (all these stages are also played in the attract mode unless otherwise noted) :


STAGE 1 : A.D. 1910 - The age of Biplane

This stage features an ordinary blue sky with clouds. The attackers are biplanes coming from random directions. Enemy planes shoots at your plane and throw hand grenades when close to you. After 56 biplanes are destroyed, the Mother Ship appears : a giant orange blimp shooting at you! Only 7 hits will destroy the Mother Ship. During the same stage, one to five parachutes will appear. Dock with them for bonus points.

This round never appears in the attract mode in any version.


STAGE 2 : A.D. 1940 - The age of Monoplane

Sky is : grey-blue with the same clouds

Enemies are : monoplane fighters, middle size bombers and large bomber (Mother Ship). Middle size bombers are aiming constantly at your plane! They can be destroyed by 4 hits and award 1,500 points.


STAGE 3 : A.D. 1970 - The age of Helicopter

Sky is once again grey-blue, only this time a different shade. The same clouds from the first two stages are also present here.

Enemies now are helicopters and large one (Mother Ship). As a new level of difficulty, the helicopters are using homing missiles.


STAGE 4 : A.D. 1982 (A.D. 1983 in Atari and Centuri versions) - The age of Jetplane

The sky is purple with the same clouds as the previous three stages.

The enemies are modern jet fighters shooting and launching homing missiles. A modern large jet bomber is the Mother Ship. This is one of the most difficult stages of the game due to increased speed of jet fighters and random direction attacks.


STAGE 5 : A.D. 2001 - The age of U.F.O.

The sky is pitch black with asteroids instead of clouds.

Hard to be reached and very hard to be passed. Great number of U.F.O.'s are attacking from any direction changing their angles of attack and throwing at your plane two types of Alien Weapons. The stage is fast paced and the Mother Ship, a superfortress U.F.O., can not be so easily destroyed. In addition, there are no enemy formations or parachutes in this stage, and there can be no more than 3 U.F.O's on the screen at a time.

This stage appears in the attract mode in the Atari and Centuri versions only.


The next, Stage 6, is identical with Stage 1, but the number of planes attacking you, the speed and number of shots and grenades are gradually increased.


TIME PILOT continues with Stage 7, 8... making your mission harder and harder. The game is all over when all your planes are destroyed.

Released in November 1982.


Licensed to Centuri for US manufacture and distribution (12/1982). Also licensed to Atari.


Yoshiki was told to design a driving game. When he learned of the game's concept, he balked at making it and started on Time Pilot. As development continued, Okamoto showed his boss design docs for the driving game, all the while working on Time Pilot. Although his boss told him to do the driving game instead, he tried to take the credit for Time Pilot. Okamoto decided not to disgrace his boss and let the episode go!!


The background moves in the opposite direction to the player's plane, rather than the other way around; the player's plane always remains in the center.


A bootleg of this game is known as "Space Pilot".


- UPDATES -


Centuri and Atari versions :

* The purple stage with the jetplanes is set in 1983 rather than 1982.

* The stage with the U.F.O.'s (A.D. 2001) is played in the attract mode.


The U.F.O. stage does not appear in the attract mode in the Konami version or bootleg "Space Pilot".


- SCORING -


Biplane/Fighter/Helicopter/Jet/UFO : 100 points.

Bomb/Missile : 100 points.

Mother Ship : 3000 points.

Bomber (Stage 2 only) : 1500 points.

Formation Bonus : 2000 points.

Parachute : 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* GAME INSTRUCTIONS :

l. Control your plane with joystick. Avoid being hit by bullets, bombs and missiles. Do not crash into enemy planes.

2. Advance to next stage by destroying 56 enemies and 7 hits on Mother Ship.

3. Dock with parachutes for bonus points.

4. Bonus plane after 10,000 points, 60,000-points and each additional 50,000 points.

5. Game over when all of your planes are destroyed.


* The enemy planes/ships find it hardest to shoot you when you are moving in a diagonal direction, so move this way the majority of the time. Just remember to watch your back!


* Since your ship is very maneuverable you can turn through 180 degrees very quickly to pick off an enemy directly behind you. Simply move the joystick or use the keys to face in the opposite direction and you will flip round.


* Homing missiles - keep firing to destroy them. Alternatively, move your fighter so that the missiles move off screen, and they do not return.


* The Mother Ships always move horizontally across the screen. Wait until they pass you, and then move directly behind them. You can then shoot them at will to destroy them. Again, it takes 7 hits to destroy a Mother Ship.


* Concentrate on collecting the parachutists where possible, as these represent your biggest potential points haul. On Stage 2 (A.D. 1940), you can leave a few planes remaining and collect parachutists for as long as possible, as this stage has no homing missiles and also more parachutists than Stage 1.


* If you are killed by colliding with an enemy ship you are registered with the points as if you had shot it. This means extra lives are still awarded and also if you collide with the Mother Ship, you will advance to the next stage, providing you have at least one life remaining.


* A Way To Get A Great Score : Finish Stage 1 (A.D. 1910) as soon as possible. On Stage 2 (A.D. 1940), don't shoot anything!! Eventually, parachutes will start to appear. Collect the parachutes while avoiding the planes. Each parachute (after #4) will give you 5,000 points. It's possible to roll the machine over (999,999+ points) while remaining on Stage 2 using this strategy. By the way, while using this cheat you can also shoot the 1,500 point bombers without causing the time bar to be shortened.

- UPDATES -


In "Battle Field", the highscore table contains different name entries than Time Soldiers.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


To accomplish the missions here requires going through time warp machines that appear on all stages. But when you're on a stage where one of your fellow time soldiers who need to be rescued is located, you should avoid entering the time warp machines, otherwise, it'll take longer to complete the missions, as you'll need to access more time machines on other stages until you get back to the specific stage where you need to find the captive. For example, if one of the captive soldiers is located on the Age of Rome stage, remain on that stage until you've reached and defeated the main boss enemy. The captive soldier will then materialize and the game will tell you that 'you destroyed the boss monster and rescued one warrior'. Then, you'll proceed to the next mission to rescue another captive soldier.

Tip Top (c) 1983 Sega.


The game begins with an animation where Bongo the gorilla approaches the sleeping hunter and gives him a 'hotfoot'. You play the hunter who has vowed revenge on Bongo for this cruel prank.

* The 1st level is Primate Peak. Climb to the top to reach Bongo the gorilla, avoiding the rolling coconuts he throws at you. Don't let the monkeys jump on your back, because if three of them get on you, they will toss you over the cliff. Press the jump button repeatedly to dislodge them. When you reach Bongo, he will retreat and you will follow him to the next level.

* The 2nd level is Snake Lake. Avoid the scorpions that crawl on the beginning side of the lake and jump onto the maze-like paths while jumping over or avoiding snakes. Jump onto the back of the submerging hippo without getting your feet wet to reach Bongo.

* The 3rd level is Rhino Ridge. Avoid the deadly puddles and dodge the charging rhinos by jumping over them or hiding down in the mole holes. Do not wait too long in any of the holes because a man in a headress randomly appears in the various pits and fills them in. When you have made it safely past the entire rhino herd, climb the rock where Bongo stands to proceed to the fourth and final level.

* Level 4 is Lazy Lagoon. Cross the water by leaping onto floating lily pads and standing rocks, and riding on the backs of submerging hippos and swimming giant fish. When you reach dry land, a couple of rhinos will be charging back and forth and after you get past them, you will find Bongo sleeping on his chair next to a fire. The hunter will finally have his revenge and give Bongo the hotfoot, after which, the game begins again, but with increased difficulty.

* Formations :

1) Line : safety mode. This mode allows both aerial and ground attacks, but you only get a narrow shot area. The multiple biplanes are susceptible to getting hit too, so watch your flying.

2) Delt a: aerial attack mode. The firepower can only hit flying planes, no ground shoots.

3) Crux : ground attack mode. Only ground objects can be hit. This is also the only mode that can destroy the boss ship.


* If you press A+B the multiple biplanes will be released. This can be used as a sort of shield.

Toobin' (c) 1988 Atari Games.


Toobin' is a unique fantasy-adventure game. 1 or 2 players can race Bif and Jet, the Toobin' dudes, in their inner tubes, down 45 different rivers. The players try to keep Jet and Bif afloat, avoiding sharp objects, gaining points, and throwing cans at obstacles. Toobin' appeals to both males and females of all ages who both find it just 'fun to play'.


Toobin' has a continuous buy-in feature so players can join in at any time. Toobin' has a color-coded control panel and players can identify Jet in the yellow inner tube and Bif in the black inner tube and red shorts.


Each player has a set of four buttons to steer Bif or Jet forwards, backwards, and sideways. Pressing the two Paddle Forward buttons moves the inner tube forward. Pressing the two Back Paddle buttons moves the inner tube backwards. Pressing only one Paddle button makes the inner tube turn. The player uses the Throw Can button to destroy obstacles in the river and stun riverside pests.


Toobin' players can enjoy amusing game play and an incredible variety of rivers and environments for their long-term enjoyment.


The player races Bif or Jet against other players, or against the game, down Toobin's 45 different rivers, paddling through six classes of play, and cruising the 15 unique river environments. The player can choose almost 200 courses through the rivers, finding his own way through rapids, obstacles, riverside pests and waterfalls.


The player has to guide Bif or Jet around obstacles, go through gates and pick up treasure to accumulate points to get more inner tube patches, collect cans to throw at obstacles and to stun riverside pests, and paddle fast enough to avoid the big 'gator lurking in all the rivers.


At the finish line, players are treated to a party. Each party grows in size until the player reaches the final super party at the end of the game.


Inner-Tube Patches : At the beginning of each game, the player has a certain number of inner-tube patches, which represent game lives. A player receives extra patches by scoring the number of points required for another patch. The number of points required changes from level to level, and is displayed in the lower left and right corners of the playfield. A player can also receive more patches by picking up patches floating in the rivers.


Cans : The player must accumulate cans to throw at obstacles and pests. All cans are the same value. The player can pick up individual cans floating in all the rivers or six-packs hidden under obstacles or in back waters (Six packs give unlimited cans). The player throws the cans by pointing Bif or Jet at the obstacle and pressing the Throw Can button.


Most of the obstacles in the river can be eliminated by hitting them with a can.


Dangers : The player must avoid or eliminate dangers in the river and stun pests on the river banks. The dangers in the river include falling rocks, floating logs, deadly falling coconuts, icebergs, mines, stampeding cattle, snakes, crocodiles, barbed wire, and thorny bushes.


Dangerous riverside pests throw and shoot objects at Bif and Jet. The player can stun most of these objectionable characters with a can thrown in their direction. These pests include Casting fishermen, Hillbillies, Terrorists, Devils, Martians, Street punks, Pistolaros, Natives, Penguins, Bears, Dinosaurs, and Cavemen.


Big 'Gator : If a player is slow, the big 'gator comes up from behind to discourage slow play and hurry the player through the gates. A loud thumping sound warns the player of its presence. One escape from the big 'gator is to quickly paddle downstream or pass through a gate. If the gator catches Bif or Jet, one inner-tube patch is lost.

Released in June 1988.


Toobin' featured a unique cabinet (as did many Atari games of the time) that featured a large marquee behind which were two rotating drums, designed to give the impression of a flowing waterfall.


Toobin' was a classic example of Atari's genius approach to abstract game design, that would typify their heyday of the mid-to-late 80s.


The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including TOOBIN.


Special Contest Feature : Every Toobin' game in the U.S. has a special contest. A player can win a free Toobin' t-shirt just for playing the game and finding and picking up all seven characters to spell the word Toobin' (including the apostrophe). These characters are hidden in the river below obstacles and hazards. The letters collected by the player are shown at the beach party at the end of the run. For more contest details, see the game (The offer expired December 1, 1988).

- SCORING -


The player can score points by :

*  Time of Travel : The player receives points simply for traveling down the river.

*  Passing through Gates. The player receives points for passing through the gates in the river. Different colored gates are worth different amounts of points. The green gates give the lowest points, then the red, gold, and finally crystal gates give the highest points.

If a players swishes a gate, that is, paddles through it without hitting the poles, he adds to his Score Multiplier (This is described in Score Multiplier below). For maximum points, the player should be the first through the gate and swish the gate. Each time the gate poles are hit, the point value of the gate falls.

*  Score Multiplier. If a player swishes the gate, the score is multiplied. Each gate that is swished adds to the multiplier. For example, if the player has a 2X multiplier, each point scored is multiplied by 2.

Every point the player scores is multiplied by the score multiplier. The score multiplier is shown in the upper left and right of the playfield, underneath the game scores. The minimum multiplier is 1 and the maximum is 5. The player must pass through every gate (whether he swishes it or not) to maintain the score multiplier. If the player misses a gate, the score multiplier is reduced by one. As long as the player passes through the gate, even if he bumps it, the score multiplier is maintained. However, if a player's tube is punctured, his score multiplier falls to one.

*  Treasures. The player can pick up treasures floating on the river or hidden under obstacles to gain extra points. The lowest-value treasure is green, next is red, and gold is the highest.

*  Warp. The warp feature moves the player to the intermediate or advanced play classes. When the player warps, he is rewarded with warp bonus points. Warping is a good way to quickly score points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you pick up a six-pack of cans, it's possible to park yourself close to a non-player character and rack up points by hitting them with the cans. The faster you are the better, so the beachball speed-up can be a big help here. 


* When the alligator comes to eat you (because you're taking too long to progress down the river) just hit him with one of the cans. This also works for certain other obstacles such as the floating mines (seeking or non-seeking). If you are quick enough, you can re-destroy the same mine several times and release multiple bonuses such as letters, treasures, sixpacks, etc. You can only throw one can at a time so any can already thrown will disappear once you press throw again.


* Collect as many points as possible and try to push your opponent into obstacles. Swish up to five gates in a row and you will correspondingly advance your score multiplier (very important). Basic gates start at 2000, 1000, 500, 250. Once passed through the gates will decrease in points until they reach 100. Swishing a gate and then bumping it numerous times before your opponent can pass is an effective move. Pick-up cans (you can carry up to 9 at a time) or a sixpack (which gives you unlimited cans). The cans are used as "ammo" to hinder your opponent, stun other game characters, or to destroy certain obstacles (some obstacles are only temporarily destroyed). When you have a blowout you lose your sixpack and your score multiplier resets to 1. Your multiplier will go down each time you miss a gate.


* Obstacles in the water (icebergs, bushes, mines, etc.) can reveal hidden points, sixpacks, patches (extra life), beachballs (speedup), including the fabled colorful letters. These letters are worth 10,000 points a piece. Try to have your score multiplier as high as possible to maximize the letter bonus at the end of each class. Be on the lookout for the 25,000 point gate since swishing it can give you up to 125,000 points if your score multiplier is 5! Unlike the other gates however, you only get one chance at the 25,000. Also be on the lookout for falling rocks, jumping penguins, submarines with nasty torpedoes, etc. On the first and second start gate you can utilize the warp whirlpool that will send you to a higher class. Many non-player characters chase you along the way. Watch out for the alligator, he likes to come out when you stall and he always comes from the top of the screen. You must go through a gate to repel that alligator before he appears or before he gets you.


* A simple way to get a very high score : In only a minute or so, there's a way you can rack up over a million points. On Class 1, after going towards the first gate, direct your innertube to the right-hand side of the screen. You should see a sign that says 'This Way to Class 2' and a whirlpool should appear next to it. Shoot the twigs in front of the entrance and paddle back up. You will now be at the start of Class 2. Immediately move to the right of the screen, the same sign will appear, only this one warps you to Class 3. Shoot the iceberg in front, paddle back up and end up on class 3. The best part about the warps is that after each one, you get 600,000 points each. That's 1,200,000+ for doing very little work. An added bonus is that you will have four patches left in reserve thanks to the excess points you will have accumulated.

Top Gunner (c) 1986 Konami.


Top Gunner is a pseudo-3-D shooter. The game starts by dropping a jeep, by parachute, onto a beach. Then two men parachute in and get into the jeep. Now it's up to you to do two things. First, liberate the POW's and second, wreak mayhem and chaos as you blaze a path of glory toward main headquarters. Of course, the road to victory won't be easy. In your path stands an enemy ready to repulse your attack with a whole arsenal of weapons at their disposal. You do have, though, a jeep capable of turning that arsenal of weapons into a mass of scrap metal.

- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is pretty complicated due to the fact that there are a lot of things you can get points for.

BOMBER : 2000 Points

ENEMY SOLDIER : 100 Points

FLAMETHROWER SOLDIER : 200 Points

GRENADE THROWING JEEP : 300 Points

GUN (SMALL, FIRE WHITE SHOTS) : 200 Points

GUN (LARGE, FIRE RED SHOTS) : 400 Points

HELICOPTER : 2000 Points

MISSILE : 400 Points

MISSILE LAUNCHER : 1300 Points

GUN BOATS : 800 Points

SUBMARINE WITH LASER : 1000 Points

TANK (SMALL, FIRE WHITE SHOTS) : 400 Points

TANK (MEDIUM, FIRE RED SHOTS) : 800 Points

TANK (LARGE, FIRE BLACK SHOTS) : 1000 Points

TROOP TRANSPORT : 100 Points


You also get points for saving POW's and dropping them off at the airfields. The scoring goes like this for POW's; for POW's you liberate from the huts :

First : 100 points

Second : 200 points

Third : 400 points

Fourth : 1000 points

Fifth : 2000 points

Sixth : 3000 points

Seventh : 5000 points

Eighth : 10000 points


You get 10,000 points for every POW rescued after the eighth one. If your jeep gets destroyed, the progression starts over again.


For POW's you drop off at the airstrip, the progression works the same as for liberated POW's. The difference is that if you move away from the airstrip, the progression starts over at 100 points again. If you manage to offload all 8 POW's without breaking away from the airstrip or getting destroyed, each POW

liberated after that is worth 10,000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


The name of the game is POWERUPS. Your success in this game will depend solely on your ability to obtain and KEEP powerups. Your jeep is equipped with two weapons : a machine gun (always shoots up in TG) and a rocket type weapon that shoots the direction you are facing and can be 'boosted' in various ways and usually in steps or levels of powerup. The default level is short range rocket, which Will stop and destroy many buildings and all vehicles.


Here are the levels of powerup you can obtain for your rocket weapon :

1) Short Range Rocket (default) - shoots a short range rocket.

2) Long Range Rocket - shoots a long range rocket (almost the entire length of the screen).

3) Horizontal Exploding Rocket - same as above but the rocket explodes in two directions horizontally, taking out anything the schrapnel hits.

4) Diagonal Exploding Rocket - same as above but the rocket explodes in 4 directions diagonally, taking out anything the schrapnel hits.


There are a couple of ways of boosting your rocket weapon. The assumed way is to blow up the special bunkers that have a single gun turret and a single POW - picking up the POW will give you a nice points bonus as well as a POWERUP to the next level of rocket weapon. These bunkers are available every so often - but you will need a little something extra to get further in the game. You need to get full powerup quickly - and this is how you do it. A diversion in the game (not required to actually finish it) is to shoot open bunkers and pick up POWs - this is above and beyond the single POW bunkers you can snag guys from. Your jeep can handle a total of 8 POWs. First trick - NEVER fill your jeep to capacity - always leave a single slot open. If you fill your jeep up and run across a single 'power up' bunker, you won't be able to pick the POW up and get your powerup. Now, just before you get to the helicopter pad (to release the POWs), you will almost ALWAYS find a bunker with a single powerup POW. Blow it up, get the POW ,the powerup, and that will fill your jeep to capacity. YOU WANT YOUR JEEP FULL BEFORE STOPPING AT THE CHOPPER PAD. Clear the area of enemies around the pad (you don't want any suprise enemies popping up and making you move) then park and start releasing the POWs. DO NOT MOVE UNTIL THE LAST MAN IS AWAY. Once all eight are out of the jeep, you can get the heck out of there (chances are, you will being stalked or about to be killed) You will receive a great bonus of points and FULL POWERUP on your rocket weapon! Talk about tilting the odds in your favor! You can do this EACH and EVERY time you are at a helicopter pad! This will earn you HUGE scores and keep your weapon up to snuff.


Remember, every time you die, you lose ONE level of powerup - so aside from the understood incentive for staying alive, you want to also maintain your weapon. Best of all - YOU GET A HUGE BONUS for picking up the powerup POWs when you are at full rocket weapon strength. If you want to see your score skyrocket, get full powerup and start plucking those powerup POWs up. Later in the game, you will need to strategically stop on the helicopter pad to allow yourself to shoot up and to a left angle to shoot down bomber planes that will DEFINITELY start showing up. If you can kill them the second they appear on the screen, none of their bombs will hurt you. If you miss lining up the jeep right, or you miss the plane, you will HAVE to move before the last guy gets out of the jeep or die. It takes some practice (you can't 'reposition' the jeep after the first man gets out or you lose the bonus) but you'll get to be a pro in no time. Enemies are not random in this game, so you can learn where tanks and enemy jeep vehicles reside quite quickly. While it sounds like a 'duh' tip, keep the enemy count low - especially enemy soldiers on foot. While they are little more than an annoyance at the beginning of the game, they QUICKLY become formidable enemies and keeping the number of them 'on screen' to a minimum is a requirement. The enemy subs can be killed before they are all the way out of the water as well as while they are going back in (i.e. when they aren't firing). Learn their location and plant rockets in the water before they have a chance to fire on you. In a two player game, have the player NOT offloading POWs to the helicopter 'stand guard' against the bomber planes (and other enemies for that matter). Then swap off and let the other one offload. Enemies are still 'active' hidden partially off screen (but they don't move or fire). Use this to kill enemies before they take a stance against you (the big tanks especially). Most vehicles can be killed with enough shots from your machine gun. If you don't feel you can reposition yourself in time to line up your rocket, pound away with bullets and hope you kill him first.

Tornado Baseball (c) 07/1976 Midway.


The game is a very simple game of baseball, implemented with stick figures. The game is very simple in terms of rules, and anybody can pick up on how to play fairly quickly. This is a two player only title, with both people playing for a single quarter. The pitching player selects his pitch with one joystick, while moving his outfielders with a second one. The batting player only has a single button (that is a 'swing' button). Both players use the same set of controls, so they must switch spots in front of the machine midway through each inning. You get a four inning game for one quarter, although that number can be adjusted by the game operator.


- TECHNICAL -


Tornado Baseball came in a two tone brown upright cabinet, heavily decorated with sticker sideart of baseball players in action. The cabinet design dates itself by its straight up and down design, without a curve to be seen anywhere on the machine. The field is displayed using an open frame monitor, mirror, and a blacklight to make it seem as though the action is taking place on a picture of a baseball field that is housed inside the cabinet.

One of the first arcade baseball titles to try and put a lot of players on the field at once.


The technique of using mirrored-in graphics in the game was the work of Dave Nutting. The game was designed for Midway by Dave Nutting Associates.


A Tornado Baseball cabinet can be seen in the 2004 film "Anchorman - The Legend of Ron Burgundy" starring Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, and Christina Applegate

Total Carnage (c) 1992 Midway.


A pseudo-sequel to Williams' superb 1990 shoot-em-up, "Smash TV", Total Carnage is set in a futuristic parody of the first Gulf War. General Ahkboob, himself an obvious parody of Sadam Hussein, has set his vast army of infantry, tanks and BioGenetic Mutants onto the world.


1 or 2 players must fight through the enemy-packed levels, rescuing reporters and civilians as they go. Total Carnage retains the dual-joystick control of its predecessor, but introduced new weapons, enemies and large, scrolling levels to the original game-play.


As with "Smash TV", Total Carnage features the infamous 'Pleasuredome'; accessible only if players manage to collect the 220 keys that are hidden throughout the game's levels. Total Carnage has a much higher difficulty level than that of "Smash TV".

General Akhboob's role as a parody of Saddam Hussein becomes obvious during the game's cut-scenes; as well as him saying slogans from "Smash T.V.", he makes an obvious reference to the original Gulf War by announcing that 'all we are making is baby milk.'.


While playing the game, there is a message which says 'the pistons will rule the NBA'. This is a reference to the Detroit Pistons who Mark Turmell was a fan of. Coincidentially 12 years later, The Detroit Pistons would win the NBA Championship.

- TRIVIA -


Released in June 1984.


The Tower of Druaga (or 'TOD' for short) was originally called 'The Tower of ANU' during the development.


Prince Gilgamesh is the same Gilgamesh of Sumerian legend.


Characters and much of the equipment found in the TOD series have appeared or been referenced to in many other Namco games.

"Tales of Phantasia" : Much of the equipment used by Gilgamesh could be obtained.

"Tales of Destiny" : Contained an optional dungeon based directly off of the original Tower of Druaga (but with different treasures).

"Tales of Symphonia" : The equipment used by Gilgamesh could be obtained, and the character Zelos Wilder could gain a special title by wearing it.

"Tales of the World - Narikiri Dungeon 3" : Also contains a variation of the dungeon. The game also contains costumes for Gilgamesh, Ki and Druaga which allows the heroes to become them in battle, and wearing the Gilgamesh costume is necessary to access the dungeon in the first place.

"Tales of Legendia" : One of the 'Rare Monsters' that you can find and battle is the Quox, the dragon enemies from the Druaga games.

"Mr. Driller - Drill Land" : Contains 5 worlds, one of which is called Hole of Druaga featuring a Mr. Driller game with RPG elements.

"Mr. Driller Ace" : Featured two levels named after Druaga characters - the 'Druaga Ruins' and the 'Quox Ruins'.

"Namco x Capcom" : Several characters from the series appear in this cross over.

"Baten Kaitos" : Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean: The Tower of Druaga makes an appearance as a puzzle in Mira, complete with slimes and tools. Baten Kaitos also contains some of Gilgamesh's equipment as obtainable items.

"Soul Edge" : Gilgamesh's shield (the red-line shield) and the Blue Crystal Rod make appearances as alternate weapons for Sophitia.

"Soul Calibur II" : One of Sophitia's alternate costumes was based off of Ki's design. In addition, one of her weapon sets was the Blue Crystal Rod and Blue Line Shield, equipment formerly used by Gilgamesh and Ki. The Red Crystal Rod and Red Line Shield are also available as bonus weapons for Cassandra.


Namco released a boardgame based on this game (same name) in 1985 (in Japan only) : You move through each level of the dungeon to get a key. You roll a dice for movement, take the shortest route towards the key, and after every roll (the game does not even have rooms or such), you have an encounter with a monster that you must fight. You get a treasure for each victory, and once you have the key, you can open the door that leads to the next level, and continue doing so on each level until you get to the 6th level where the princess is.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Easter Egg :

1) Enter service mode.

2) Select sound 19

3) Press the service switch to display the grid and enter the following sequence : Up(x4), Down, Right(x2), Left(x6), Start2.

4) '(c) NAMCO LTD. 1984' will appear on the screen.


* Level Select : Keep Button1 pressed while pressing the Start button to continue the previous game; you can choose which level to start from.


* When your sword is unsheathed, your shield moves from your front to your left side. You can use this to block projectiles coming at you while attacking. This takes a lot of practice to master, though! Also, be sure to get the wing boots on level two by killing all the enemies -- it is impossible to beat the game without them.

Track and Field (c) 1983 Konami.


1 to 4 players compete against each other in 6 track and field events in this legendary, genre creating and much-copied game from Konami. Track and Field consisted of 2 run buttons per player (one for each 'leg' of the athlete) and one action button. Only 2 players could compete simultaneously so on 3 and 4-player games, players had to wait their turn. An extra life is awarded for every 100,000 points acquired. Each player must qualify in the current event before they can move on to the next. Hit the 2 run buttons to build up speed and use action button to jump or throw. The events are :

* 100M DASH - Run as fast as possible.

* LONG JUMP - Run to the take-off board then choose angle of jump (42 is optimal).

* JAVELIN - Run to the line then choose angle of throw (42 is optimal).

* 110M HURDLES - Run and time jumps over the hurdles.

* HAMMER THROW - As the athlete spins faster and faster, time release of hammer and angle of throw (45 is optimal).

* HIGH JUMP - The athlete will run to the bar, just as he reaches it, use Action button to start the jump and hold down the action button to reduce the angle of climb, i.e. you start going straight up at 90 degrees if you tap the button just once. Use run buttons while in the air to gain extra height.

- TRIVIA -


Released in October 1983.

Licensed to Centuri for US manufacture and distribution (October 1983).


Track and Field proved to be incredibly successful for Konami, and would spawn countless imitations - particularly on the 8-bit home systems of the time - as well as three sequels of its own. One of the undoubted reasons for its success was the superb multi-player game, which, for perhaps the first time in the video arcade, introduced a genuine sense of rivally among players and showed the gaming world what was truly possible with multi-player gaming.


The song that is heard playing on the high score and awards screen is 'Chariots of Fire', written by Vangelis for the movie of the same name.


This game is known in Asia as "Hyper Olympic", later versions of the game replaced the Run buttons with a trackball. A Bootleg of this game, called "Atlant Olimpic" was released in Italy in 1996, thirteen years after the game first appeared.


A Track and Field unit appears in the 1985 movie, 'The Goonies'.


- UPDATES -


Later versions of this game replace the two 'Run' buttons with a trackball.


- SCORING -


Points are awarded in each event. The faster the time, the further or higher the jump, or the further you throw the more points you score.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* 100m Dash : Achieve exactly the same time for player 1 and 2 and 1000 point bonus will be awarded.


* Long Jump : 3 jumps of exactly the same length will cause a little man with a key to run across the screen, awarding 1000 points.


* Javelin : Throw the javelin off the top of the screen to bring down a bird for a 1000 point bonus. To do this you must achieve the 'maximum' angle.


* 110m Hurdles : If both players finish the race in a dead heat then a little man with a key will run across the screen, awarding 1000 points to each player.


* High Jump : Fail the first two jumps and then clear it; a mole burrows up for a 1000 point bonus. 


* Hint : When you alternate tapping the run buttons (run1, run2, run1, run2 etc.) you will get a much better speed increase. You have three attempts to qualify on all but the two running events.


* BUG : In both Javelin and the Hammer Throw, throwing over 100m will cause a counter wraparound, so a 100m12 throw will be logged as 0m12 (and will not qualify you).

Treasure Hunt (c) 1982 Hara Industries.


This game plays a lot like "Donkey Kong" except that the controls are not quite as smooth. There are five screens to master if you want to help Jack in his mission. You do not get to play each screen at first, they are added on as you progress through the game. The first time through the game skips from screen one right to screen four.

* The first screen is fairly simple, you just have to climb to the top of the beanstalk. There are a few enemies, but they can be defeated by simply tossing beans at them. You can find the beans scattered all around the stalk, and picking one up adds one to your ammunition count (or two, depending on the dip switch settings).

* In the second screen, Jack manuevers through the clouds and attempts to cross the drawbridge into the castle, but lions and birds stand in his way.

* The third screen has Jack climbing the castle stairway in a scene that was obviously inspired by "Donkey Kong". Avoid the cat and the mouse and you can make it to the top.

* On the fourth screen you have to jump from platform to platform until you reach the giant's lair. There will be several treasures, grab the flashing one and try to make your escape.

* The fifth screen is the first one again, except that this time you are climbing down the beanstalk, and you have falling rocks to dodge, and the giant himself may even be after you (that one depends on the level).


After making it back to your house you get to watch a little intermission before going after the next treasure. There are four different treasures altogether. The last one is the princess, when you have her the giant himself will follow you down the beanstalk, and you must chop it down to defeat him. After rescuing the princess the game starts over with increased difficulty.

- SCORING -


Points are scored by completing squares and knocking out enemies.

Connect 2 squares at one, score doubles.

Connect 3 at once, it quadruples.

Bonus scores between second and third stage.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Begin by filling in the box in the lower left-hand corner. Once you've done that, fill in the two boxes (vertically) to its right, then the three to their right, and so on until you've effectively wrapped around the playfield and are back at the first box you filled in. Just repeat this motion until all of the boxes are full.


* Filling in boxes two at a time will give you twice the points of each of the boxes. Filling in three boxes at a time (this is done by going over the point shared by the three boxes last) gives you four times points for the boxes.


You can also get points by punching out enemies. If you can punch out an enemy while the ambulance is still on the screen, you get six hundred points instead of the three hundred for just punching out an enemy.

Trog (c) 02/1991 Midway.


1 to 4 players take on the role of a cute dinosaur, selected from the four on offer : Rex (red), Bloop (blue), Spike (yellow) and Gwen (lavender). The game takes place in a prehistoric land called 'Og' and is made up of forty-nine different islands; the dinos must collect all of the dinosaur eggs that lay on the islands, while avoiding the unwanted attention of a tribe of one-eyed cavemen, called 'Trogs'. The dinos can punch the attacking Trogs; one punch will only stun a Trog but several punches will knock the enemy off the screen. There are 4 different Trogs who pursue the dinos :

* Brown Trogs who use only their fists.

* Red Trogs who use clubs and create fires or holes in the ground.

* Blue Trogs who pop up out of the ground and roll stone wheels.

* Green Trogs who bounce around trying to crush you with their springs.

On each island, after the dinos have gathered up all of their eggs, they must make their way to the base labeled 'Home'; from here they will move on to the next island.


Between each stage, there is an intermission where the players' Dinos will dance, with an on-screen caption proudly declaring 'Excellent!', 'Congratulations!', 'Nice Work!', 'Good Job!' or 'Dino-Mite!'. On occasion, an intermission screen appears that shows a Trog planning another attempt to eat a Dino.

* PROTOTYPE REV 4.00 : This particular code revision is also referred to in other resources as 'BattleTrog'. This prototype (known in Midway as Trog Proto 4) represents the original concept for the game Trog. The plans called for a strategy game where the player character, a dinosaur, had to be manipulated via placing bones to block his or her path, similar to many home computer games of the time. However, it soon became clear on field tests that players were confused and frustrated by this method of control in an arcade setting, where such strategic thinking was rarely required. Some surveys suggested that many players expected the game to be a simple "Pac-Man"-style affair. Many customers also were concerned/laughed openly at the action buttons labelled 'Bone', the term also being used in American slang for certain 'mature' acts and at least one cabinet panel was defaced to add an 'R' to the end of the word. As a consequence of this disasterous location test, the game was nearly axed entirely. Indeed, it probably would have been had it not been for the stop motion animation created for use as sprites in game - the story is that its high cost resulted in many of the senior employees at Midway demanding that Trog remain a going concern, with a new game mechanic built around the sprites. As it turned out, the game was turned into a "Ms. Pac-Man" clone, the small and large pills replaced with eggs and pineapples. It has been argued by some, including myself, that the use of trackballs instead of joysticks would salvage the original game mechanic, but closer inspection of the hardware through the MAME emulation suggests that 4-player trackball play, or indeed any trackball play could not be included without major complications, or indeed a whole new Midway hardware unit being devised.


* REV PA6-PAC : This prototype (known in Midway as Trog II Proto 6) represents the first major step towards the final Trog concept. The devitation from the standard naming system (the game would normally be listed as Trog PA6 only) represents the change in the project, the -PAc extension added to make it perfectly clear that this was a "Pac-Man" clone. With the original plans for a strategy game abandoned due to a poor location test, new thinking was required to salvage the project - it is rumoured that too much had been invested in the animation for the project to be canned at this stage. Money became very tight on the Trog II project (Trog I being the abandoned strategy game) and so a total rewrite of the concept was out of the question - they would have to make do with the existing code libraries for the project, with only minor alterations. Pushed for time and funding, the programmers decided to make the game into the Pac-Man clone many expected it to be, as this would require the least recoding, all that would be required would be to make the dinosaurs fully controllable, instead of the guided automatons they were originally. However, it was clear that the Trog AI would make them too good for even the best of players to overcome through clever moves, so a 'Punch' option was added which replaced the 'Bone' function and led to the only new animation added in the project, - a 3 frame jab which looked poor compared to that of the Trogs due to the time pressures on Haeger at the time of animation. But I digress... With this established, the programmers then altered the level order to provide a more suitable learning curve for the game, however this destroyed the main purpose of the 'Trog's Cave' intermissions screens and meant that the order of Trog's thoughts didn't fully match his actions. Also, although some of the 'thought balloon' animations (created on the fly through the game ROMS) were changed to remove the bone breaking scenes relating to proto 4, the cave drawings (done by professional 2-D animators) could not be altered due to time and money considerations. The original ending of the game was also scrapped, as it was believed to be an anticlimax, so another hastily animated island was added for an extra challenge, purported to be Trog's Cave (Note the use of the intermission style lettering coupled with superimposed text straight from the ROM, again new graphics were out of the question). However, most of the other features remained intact, with a Complex Egg Lay option being added in the release versions to allow owners to change the egg patterns back from the Pac-Man style to the original layouts (it is believed that there may be a version of the game which put the original mechanic back in too, but no evidence of this has been found).


A Trog unit appears in the 1991 movie 'Terminator 2 - Judgment Day'.


- UPDATES -


PROTOTYPE REV 4.00 :

* The bonus groove is still part of the released game's sound test, despite the fact it is now exclusively used for Trog's Cave and the ending - the prototype's bonus sequence was longer, as time and skill points were added, thus it needed music.

* The dinosaurs punch is poorly animated - this feature was added for the new game to allow fending off of the Trogs and as a result was just a few extra frames of animation made at the 11th hour by Jack E. Haeger.

* The last level uses the Intermission 'Trog's Cave' text, complete with graphical artifacts that were cut off on its normal background, due to the need to minimize adding graphics to the already overtime and over-budget project (the rest of the explanatory text is placed on screen using the same code that superimposes the victory messages).

* The Trog's Cave sequences no longer match up with the introduction of each new enemy - due to the restructure of the levels.

* Trog is seen trying to overcome bones in the recap drawings. In reality this scene was shot for the prototype, when the player's bones could be smashed or jumped on and not replaced due to the cost of redrawing the animation (it is worth pointing out that the main scenes have bone bashing elements removed).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


While playing the game, try not to fall off the island. You must avoid or fight off any stone wheels that roll toward you and also avoid any tar pits that will occasionally appear. The Trogs are clumsy and dumb and will sometimes fall off the island, sink into the tar pits or blunder into their own traps. However, an island may have holes with warp grids that will advance your Dino two or three islands ahead if your Dino falls into it. These form when you take the shiny egg (in the lower-right corner, there will be one egg that will shine) last. In addition, all players will receive a cool 300,000 point bonus.


On some islands, there will be doors that will lead from one area to another and some will have springboards that will transport your Dino from one side of the island to another. The springboards will hurl the green Trogs to their deaths.


On each island, there are a number of special power-items to collect :

* 'Red roots' that give your Dino extra speed

* 'Yellow horseshoes' that will temporarily form a protective forcefield around your Dino

* 'Fiery chili peppers' that make your Dino to spit fireballs to burn the Trogs

* 'Ice jewels' that will momentarily freeze all the Trogs on the island

* 'Pineapples' that will temporarily turn your Dino into an unstoppable, Trog-eating tyrannosaurus rex.


Avoid the grey mushrooms as they will slow your Dino down.


Some islands have timed bonus stages that will give you a chance to earn bonus points. These stages include :

* Trog Feasts where your Dino will be a tyrannosaurus rex and will attempt to eat as many Trogs as possible before time runs out

* Trog Barbecues where your Dino will spit fireballs and try to burn as many Trogs as possible before time runs out

* Diamond Mines where your Dino will attempt to capture as many gems as possible (including diamonds, rubies and emeralds) before time runs out.


When stage is starting, take a look carefully at eggs, 1 egg will shine (little star) for 1 or 2 seconds. Get this egg as last egg on stage -> a teleport will open. You can enter to teleport instead normal exit, you will skip some stages.

Tron (c) 1982 Bally Midway.


TRON is a 1- or a 2-player game. When playing this game, TRON is under YOUR control. YOU make him move back and forth across the screen to confront his opponents, alien and otherwise. The methods he uses to eliminate these opponents depend on which phase of the rack he is in.


The game is displayed in racks; each of which has four completely separate phases. By using the control stick, the contestant(s) can determine which of the four phases he will send TRON into. Once TRON has entered and completed a phase of any particular rack, that phase will not be available again until all of the other remaining phases in that rack have been completed. If TRON is eliminated in any particular phase, the next TRON is allowed to reenter that phase to play it over again if you want him to.


The 4 phases that make up each rack are as follows :

* PHASE 1 - TANKS : You are provided with a top view of a maze with your Tank and enemy Tanks in it. The higher the number of the rack you are in, the greater the number of enemy Tanks in there with you. This phase ends when all the enemy Tanks are destroyed - or - when you are.

* PHASE 2 - GRID BUGS : A side view of a vertical grid is presented to the player in this phase. The Grid Bugs (which look something like spiders) begin to appear and start multiplying immediately. At the same time they are also coming after you. Shoot as many of these as you can while working your way to the 1.0. TOWER in the center of the screen. Once you enter this 1.0. TOWER, this phase is over.

* PHASE 3 - CYCLES : In this phase you have a top view of Cyclists. The higher the number of the rack you are in, the greater the number of enemy Cyclists in there with you. You cannot run into any walls, cross your own light trail or cross the enemy Cyclist's trail. If you do, you will be destroyed. You must box in the enemy Cyclists, forcing them to run into either their own light trail, your light trail, or a wall, destroying themselves.

* PHASE 4 - MCP BLOCKS : Here there is a rotating cylinder composed of colored blocks that is constantly descending on you. The higher the number of the rack you are in, the greater the speed with which the cylinder descends. You must either shoot all the blocks out of the descending cylinder or clear a space so you can enter the cone shaped area at its top. When you do either of these, this phase ends.


Bonus TRONS are awarded to you periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values. Each item that can be shot has an assigned point value.


The object of the game is to HAVE FUN while constantly increasing your skill as you play, wiping out as many of the enemy as possible each time to get the highest score.


TRON is made up of racks. There are 12 racks in all and the name of each is spelled out at the bottom center of the monitor screen when you are in it. The names of these racks are (from the easiest to the hardest, respectively) : RPG, COBOL, BASIC, FORTRAN, SNOBOL, PL1, PASCAL, ALGOL, ASSEMBLY, OS, JCL, USER

Each rack contains 4 SEPARATE games : TANKS, LIGHT CYCLES, M.C.P. BLOCKS, GRID BUGS


You MUST SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE EACH of the separate games that make up a particular rack BEFORE you can be advanced to the next rack which will consist of the same 4 games - but they will be harder to complete successfully.


Game selection is random. For instance, if you always pull back on the joystick when you enter a new rack, you WILL NOT always get the same game. One time it could be Tank's, the next it might be Grid Bugs, and so on.


TANKS : In this game you are driving the light colored Tank. The knob on the control panel aims the Tank's gun. The joystick controls your Tank's direction of travel and the trigger on the joystick fires your Tank's gun. ALL enemy Tanks (dark blue or rust colored) must each be hit 3 times to be eliminated. However, they only have to hit your Tank 1 time to eliminate you.

The rust colored enemy Tanks [Recognizers] DO NOT shoot at you but they do travel at a very fast speed and will try to ram you. If they (or a blue one for that matter) touch your Tank, you've had it.


LIGHT CYCLES : In this game you are driving the blue Light Cycle. Wherever you go with it you leave a trail of blue light. Your opponents are driving the Yellow Light Cycles (anywhere between 1 and 3 of them).

The knob on your control panel has NO EFFECT in this game. The joystick controls the direction your Light Cycle will go. The trigger on the joystick controls the speed of your Light Cycle. If you pull it, your Light Cycles speed will be approximately doubled. If you release it, you will slow down again.

You cannot stop or back up. You cannot touch their light trail, the walls, or your own light trail. If you do, you will be eliminated. You must out maneuver your opponents, causing them to run into the walls, your light trail, or their own light trail. This will eliminate them.


MCP BLOCKS : In this game you are placed under a rotating multicolored cylinder which has a cone on top of it. This descends on top of you and you cannot get out from underneath it. You have 2 choices : 1) shoot out all the blocks the descending multicolored cylinder is made of and then enter the cone at its top or 2) shoot a passageway through the blocks of the descending multi colored cylinder and enter the cone at its top through the passageway you just cleared. The latter of these two choices is very tricky to say the least. If you are touched by any part of the multicolored blocks in the rotating cylinder you will be disintegrated.

As above, the joystick controls Tron's movements to the left, right, and up or down. The knob on the control panel moves Tron's arm. Pulling the trigger on the joystick fires Tron's weapon in the direction that his arm is pointing.


GRID BUGS : In this game you are placed on a grid which has an I/O Tower (Input/Output Tower) at its center and Grid Bugs all around it. The I/O Tower is equipped with a counter that counts backward from 1000 to 0 at a high rate of speed. This is equal to about 35 seconds.

As above, the joystick controls Tron's movements to the left, right, and up or down. The knob on the control panel moves Tron's arm. Pulling the trigger on the joystick fires Tron's weapon in the direction that his arm is pointing.

The object of this game is to shoot as many Grid Bugs as you can during the allotted time while working your way to the entrance to the I/O Tower. You must enter the I/O Tower before the counter reaches zero. If you fail to enter the I/O Tower before the time runs out - or - if you are touched by a Grid Bug, you will be disintegrated.

- TRIVIA -


Released in May 1982.


When Bally/Midway signed a deal to create a Tron video game, they were very pressed for time and needed a game quickly. They decided to let all 3 of their design teams (their in-house team, Dave Nutting Associates, and Arcade Engineering) take a crack at a prototype. The Dave Nutting Associates team (led by Dave Armstrong) proposed a 3-D color vector game that was deemed too complex and expensive, thought it was later developed into a prototype called "Earth, Friend, Mission". The internal team eventually won the right to produce the game. The initial design document called for 6 different mini-games :

1) Rings (a light-disk duel between Tron and Sark).

2) Paranoia (in which the player builds a bridge of spiders to reach an island).

3) Tank Pursuit

4) Space Spores

5) I/O Tower (the player tries to reach an energy socket while avoiding electrifying blue warriors)

6) Light Cycles.


Fearing that they would never get the game out in time, the Rings game was made into a separate game and the Paranoia and I/O Tower game was dropped (though the MCP Cone sequence was later added). At one point the film included deadly spores that were included in the game's Grid Bug sequence, but when they were removed from the movie, they had to be removed from the game as well.


To promote the game, Bally/Midway and Alladin's Castle sponsored a seven-week-long tournament at over 400 locations throughout the country, as well as a celebrity tournament.


Most of the levels correspond to a computer language. Of course, some literary license was used for the level names and a couple of them don't really make sense. Anyway, here are the 11 level names and what they are :

ALGOL : Algorithmic Language. Influenced the development of more modern language (along with FORTRAN and LISP). Used for number crunching.

ASSEMBLY : Machine language. Used to write code directly to the computer without having to compile or interpret it.

BASIC : Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. Used primarily for teaching rudimentary programming.

COBOL : Common Business Oriented Language. Used primarily for accounting. Very old language.

FORTRAN : Formula Translator. Used for processing numbers and/or formulas.

JCL : Job Control Language. Used on IBM mainframes to execute specific jobs and scripts on the Job Entry Subsystem.

OS : Precursor language to OS2.

PASCAL : Teaching language for compiled languages. Not very powerful.

PL1 : A play on the actual language called PLI. Language used for solving mathematical problems.

RPG : Report Program Generator. Use for generating reports. Usually used with COBOL.

SNOBOL : Used for character string manipulation.


Walt Disney Productions sued Williams Electronics for copyright and patent infringement over Williams' use of the name 'tron' in their arcade legend, "Robotron - 2084". Common sense prevailed, however, and Williams won the suit.


The game's sequel, "Discs of Tron" was originally intended to be a part of the original game but tight time constraints meant that the mini-game was not completed in time.


A Tron unit appears in the 1983 movie, 'War Games', in the 1986 movie 'The Color of Money' and in the 1987 movie, 'Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown'.


- UPDATES -


OLDER VERSION (set 4 in Mame) :

* Level 1 (RPG) gives you 1,000 on the timer instead of 500 in the I/O Tower game, making it easier to get the 1,000 point bonus for killing all grid bugs in level 1.

* The series of sounds that play when blocks are destroyed in the MCP Cone game are higher in pitch than in the other revisions of Tron.

* Each level features different pattern schemes from the other revisions - Play level 2 (COBOL) in Set 1, 2, or 3 and then play level 2 in Set 4, keeping the Game Difficulty setting at the default (5) each time, and you'll see what we mean.


- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is relatively easy since there aren't a lot of enemies to keep track of.

Grid Bugs : 50 points

Bit : 5000 points

Blocks : 25 points

Light Cycles : 500 points


Tanks...

1st Hit : 100 points

2nd Hit : 300 points

3rd Hit : 500 points


You get a 1,000 point bonus for destroying all the Grid Bugs.

You get the remaining time added to your score when you enter the I/O Tower.


NOTE : On Level 1 (RPG), you only get 500 on the timer. On all other levels, you get 1000 on the timer. EXCEPTION : In older version of Tron (set 4 in Mame), you always get 1000 on the timer, even on Level 1.


You get a 1,000 point bonus for destroying all the Blocks.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


When you start the game, you will have a cursor in the middle of a computer-looking grid. You have 8 seconds to go one of 4 directions on that grid. If you don't, you will be randomly sent in a direction. Once you have completed an area, you can no longer go to that area until you get to the next level. The areas are randomized on this computer grid so you won't know what you will get next. Below are the four areas and strategies to get through them.


* I/O TOWER : This is one of the easier areas to get through. It just involves a lot of shooting.

- Quickly establish where the Grid Bugs are. That way you can quickly aim to clear out a path if necessary.

- The game simulation sailer comes out at random times and drops the Bit off. Do everything you can to get to it for a free 5,000 points.

- Work your way to one of the exits and 'camp out'. Just use the spinner to aim high and low to take care of the Grid Bugs. Once the timer hits 100, go ahead and exit the screen.

- It is possible to get over 10,000 points in this area alone (5,000 for the Bit and over 5,000 for Grid Bugs killed).

- On the earlier levels, try to take out all of the Grid Bugs for the 1,000 point bonus.


* LIGHT CYCLES : This is one of the harder areas until you learn the patterns. Then it will become a breeze.

- The arena for this game is a 9 x 9 grid. Use the grid lines to gauge distances and to also know where the turns are.

- Hitting the wall, your light trail, or an enemy light trail will end your cycling career very quickly.

- Depending on the machine set up, you will need to identify different patterns and make the appropriate adjustments to your strategy. Make sure you are staying at full speed until the enemy light cycles are trapped.

- Usually you can adjust when you see enemy cycles coming after you. A lot of times they will follow another cycle into the wall or a light trail. The enemy cycles become much quicker after level 10.

- If the three light cycles are coming straight down, go right and up around them. Then do a rectangle pattern leaving an opening to the right side to allow the enemy cycles to crash against the wall.

- Use the above pattern if the middle or right cycles go straight (the other ones will veer around before they head down).

- For any other occasion, it's best to go left and make a box that way. Again, the enemy cycles will destroy themselves before you get into trouble.


* MCP CONE : Another easier area.  Even if you mess up a little, you can still recover from your mistake.

- First, determine the cone's speed and direction of travel. You can accomplish the second thing by shooting at it to determine which way the hole travels.

- Next, determine your speed. This will determine how much time you have to blow through the cone to get to the exit.

- Once you have determined the above, go over to the side that the cone is entering from. For example, if the cone is moving from left to right, the go over to the left side and start shooting.

- The 4 block cones are pretty easy. Just rapidly blast a path and go up.

- The 6 block cones are a little trickier. You will need to open up the bottom part of the cone. Enter this new opening and start to chew at the top. You will end up having blocks rotate below you as you head up. Be careful and watch around you since you will end up surrounded by blocks before you enter the exit.

- The hardest cone to get through is when Tron is traveling fast and the cone is moving slow. You have to quickly blast a path any way you can or you will collide with the cone.

- For extra points, you can position yourself half-way out of the exit and blast at the top blocks. On the earlier levels, try to get the 1,000 point bonus.


* TANKS : Probably the hardest area of the game. You have to learn how to move and shoot (in different directions) at the same time.

- It takes 3 hits to destroy an enemy tank. You have the advantage, though, by being able to use rapid fire and bouncing your shots off the walls. Enemy tanks can only have one shot out a time.

- This rebounding of shots can be a very effective offensive measure. You may be able to hit tanks from afar or hit them around corners just by rebounding your shots just right. Prevent them from getting close.

- The pink teleporter area is the key to surviving many of the tank patterns. Just don't go too far in or you may end up teleporting to a hostile environment very quickly.

- If you stay off the tank trails, enemy tanks will not fire on you. They can, however, ram your tank (this is especially true if you are hanging out in the teleportation area).

- Like other parts of Tron, there are patterns you can use on the specific tank patterns to ensure your survival.


* This is an interesting bug. On the MCP Cone levels, if you go all the way to the right or the left and keep moving, you can move the whole playfield to the side. This doesn't seem to have any other affect.


* Here's an odd Tron bug : On the Recognizer Tank levels, make your way to one of the little alcoves in either the top right, or bottom left corners. The tanks cannot shoot, and will not go down an alcove, so therefore cannot kill you. Then, wait approximately 9 to 10 minutes without moving your tank. You can fire, but do not kill all the recognizers. After the time (9-10 mins), the sound system will go berzerk, starting with a very high pitch tone, which falls to a low tone that vibrates the cabinet. The sound also goes berzerk if you enter the tower at 0099 units on the bug screen.

Tropical Angel (c) 1983 Irem.


An abstract take on the 3d racing genre, Tropical Angel puts the player in control of a female water-skier who must dodge the many rocks that protrude from the water while attempting to steer through a set number of gates - in the form of a pair of flags - before the time limit expires. The acceleration button needs to be held down all the time while the 'trick' button makes the water-skiing girl spin through one-eighty degrees and proceed to ski backwards. The player cannot steer while traveling backwards, but will earn bonus points for the duration of the trick. As the game progresses, small ramps, buoys and sharks come into play. The small ramps can be jumped to add to the player's score, although they're always in difficult to reach locations. The buoys are usually very close together, but skiing between them earns bonus points. Finally, the shark will appear from time-to-time, running into it means game over, regardless of how much time the player has left.

Tumble Pop (c) 1991 Data East.


Tumble Pop is an platform game at single screen similar to Bubble Bobble and Snow Bros. Like in these games, the task of the player is to clear the entire screen of all the enemies; after the screen is cleaned, the player is teleported into another screen to cleaning, until he reach to the boss of the stage. When the boss is defeated, the stage is cleared and the player can play the next one. The stages are all setted in various parts of the world, each of them shows differents enemies : there are the clowns of Russia, the mummies of Egypt, the robots of France and other differents coloured and sympathetic little monsters. At the beginning of the game the player can also choose the nation where he want to start to play. After that all the world is cleaned by the monsters, the players will travelling even into the space(!) for defeating once for all the evil Mad Doctor.


The particularity of Tumble Pop is the ability of capture the enemies (with theyr special vacuum cleaner that can catch a certain numbers of enemies) and then throw them against the walls for being eliminated, or also they can be throwed against other enemies, like in Snow Bros. Killed enemies will let bonus items for points and power-ups. There are several items hidden in the screen, the player can discover them by throwing the enemies all over the screen or against the corners.

- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1991.


Tumble Pop is the first of a trilogy of similar games produced by Data East, all with the same gameplay but at least with just few differences : a year after Tumble Pop, in 1992 Data East released "Diet Go Go", similar to Tumble Pop in the game mechanics, but the vacuum cleaner are discarded with special fruits released by the players for pump up the enemies; at this point the enemy will fly up to the screen, and the player spin him against the other enemies simply by touching him while he's flying. In 1994 is released '"Joe & Mac Returns", still similar to Tumble Pop, but the players must first dizzy the enemies with theyr canes, then capturing them and at least throw against the other enemies. 


There are several references with other Data East games with the enemies of Tumble Pop :

* Firts of all, the fat arabian-type guy spitting flames from mouth is, naturally, a retrieval of the good old Karnov, even if it's not too identical of the original in the esthetics (the eating-fire guy of Tumblepop miss the thin mustaches, and even the eyes are different). This enemy appear in the stage of Russia, Egypt and Brazil.

* In the Australia stage, the cavemans and carnivorous plants are the same of those appearing in Caveman Ninja. The end level boss is identical to the Giant Carnivorous Plant of the second stage, still on Caveman Ninja.

* The end level boss of Brazil stage (the fire dragon) is almoust similar to the mid boss of the second stage of Chelnov - Atomic Runner (the Giant Dog with iron mask). Some of his patterns are also similar to another boss of Caveman Ninja.

* The 'pain scream' of some bosses was copied by the Dinosaurs growl of Caveman Ninja.

* In the stages of the Space, one enemy (the alien with white suit and helmet) is exactly identical to Chelnov. Even his fire attacks are identical to one of the power ups of the game Chelnov - Atomic Runner.


In the stage of Brazil, in the first scheme there are five special letters hidden (See TIPS AND TRICKS section to learn more about the special letters) that joined togheter forms the name SENNA : a clearly omage to the late brasilian F1 world champion Ayrton Senna.


In 1994 an anonymus korean software house, Dong Gue La Mi Ltd., maked an hack version of this game, named "Pang Pang". This game is simply awful, with all the backgrounds of the original game changed with the backgrounds of Super Pang. Also, you can't catch the enemies with the vacuum cleaner, but you can catch them inside some bobbles, exactly like in Bubble Bobble. The main character of the game controlled by the player is an horrible rip-off of the hero of Tumble Pop.


The final boss and villain of the game, Mad Doctor, appears also in "Diet Go Go" and "Spin Masters", both still developed by Data East.


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Wolf Fang, Tumble Pop - PCCB-00084) on 21/03/1992.

Bootlegs don't use the HuC6280 @ 4.0275 Mhz :-)


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


For eliminate an enemy, the simple way is to catch him with the vacuum cleaner, and then throw him away before he get out by himself and kill you. You can also throw an enemy against other one, and especially catch more enemies at time, so to create a real "avalanche" that will run over the others. The basic strategy for every scheme is to catch more enemy at possible, and then trhow them away against the other enemies, so you can clean up the whole screen and accumulate many points.


Every enemy killed will still release a item that give you bonus points (coins, gems, diamonds, etc).


For catch an enemy, press the FIRE button and hold it while the enemy will be breathed inside the vacuum cleaner. However, there is a simple trick to catch them more fastly : press the fire button ONCE against the enemy, or press the fire button and then turn back to him fastly; the enemy wil get dizzy for few seconds. Now, just press again the fire button to immediatly aspire him inside the vacuum cleaner. Now keep the fire button while you don't decide to drop him. REMEMBER: You can't hold enemies in your vaccum cleaner for more than 4-5 seconds.


The enemies generally walking through the screen and jumping to above platforms. Especially, there are some kinds of enemies that can turn themself into a type of tornado before go up or down to the near platforms; in this moment these enemies are invincible, you can't catch them and also the 'tornado form' will block eventually enemies that you've throwed against them.


When you fight a boss, you must defeat him by catching the weapons or enemies that he will drop to you, and then throw these agaist him. If you catch more of three enemies, you'll give more damage to the boss.


In determinates schemes, there are some types of jars, that will release constantly new enemies. The form of this jars changing with the stage's background, but despite this these are all identical to each other. You need to hit these jars throwing enemies against two or three times for destroy these. After destroyed, the jars still release some gems. Sometimes could be two jars in the same scheme.


You can catch the enemies even through the walls. This is a great vantage to you, especially against those enemies that can shoot from far distances or when you're near too busy platforms.


There are several bonus itmes and power ups hidden all over the screen. At the beginning those are not visible; you must first at all catch some enemies and then throw him in all the superfice of the level, and especially near the corner where the power-ups are still frequent.

Droping a single enemy is not effective for discover all the bonus of a scheme: the best way is to catch three enemies or more and then thow they in an vantagious point that make they roll over the whole screen and then revealing the bonus.


The power ups are generally placed in the various corners at the left or right of the screen, and occasionally in the central platforms of the screen. Keep this on mind if you actually looking for a power up.


There are several power ups :

"POW tin" : increase the range of action of your vacuum cleaner.

"Skate" : make the player's character movements more faster.

"Star" : Give to the player a barrier that make him invincible for a dterminate time and kill the enemies with the simple contact.

"Laser Pistol" : Turn your vacuum cleaner in a laser pistol, that kill all the enemies and jars instantly.

"Package ?" : This will recall an large vacuum cleaner above the screnn that will clean up the whole screen of eìevery enemy and bonus item: however, the points for the bonus and enemies are still added to the player's score, but you'll not take the benefit of the power ups.

"Tumblepop's Guy" : this is the classical 1UP item, so give to you an extra life. Only available in the bonus stage.


Special letters : these are special items that will appear in the screen like the other bonus items. At the button of the screen there are the word TUMBLE POP written with this letter placed inside blue balls. You must collect the letters that make the word TUMBLE POP : once you've completed it, you'll be teleported into a bonus stage where you can collect any type of money and gems and an extra life, before time runs out. If you made to collect all the items, the spared time will become bonus points. After the bonus stage is completed, you'll be teleported into the next scheme. There are some letters that don't belong to the word TUMBLE POP, while there are others that progressive changing in alphabetical way. All the letters value as extra points.


In the final stage, before you fight against the final boss (Mad Doctor), you'll fight before against the previous bosses. This is the only time that you can found power ups in the boss fight.

Turbo [Sit-Down model] (c) 1981 Sega.


A 3-D racing game from Sega in which the player must pass a set number of rival racers (usually 30) before the time limit expires. Success would see the player progress to the next stage. Turbo's gameplay was unique in that centered ENTIRELY on the passing of cars; while the tracks the player raced on had all of the usual bends and turns of the racing genre, they existed purely for effect and at no point did the player actually have to STEER through them.


Turbo was the world's first full-colour, sprite scaling racing game and not, as many assume, Namco's "Pole Position". Turbo was released a full year before the Namco legend and is a further example of how Sega have dominated and innovated within the arcade racing genre.


Top scores were kept on a LED panel to the left of the screen (unfortunately these scores reset every-time you turn the game off).

A Turbo unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance' and is featured prominently in the band Rainbow's 1982 video 'Death Alley Driver'.


A Turbo machine was shown at the 2003 classic arcade games show 'California Extreme' in San Jose, California.


MB (Milton Bradley) released a boardgame based on this videogame (same name) in 1983, 'You're in the Driver's Seat for High-Speed Fun.' : Players spin the spinner and move their cars along the track. Cars printed on spaces of the track block movement, so players can set up blockades in places to keep from being passed. First one across the finish line wins. There is also an ambulance participating in the race.


- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is combination of things. Your score is tied to distance traveled so obviously you want to cover the most amount of distance in the shortest period of time. You also get a bonus at the end of any time cycle of : Cars Passed x 50


There are two ways that you can extend your game time :

1) The initial way is that you have to pass 39 cars in 95 seconds, if you achieve this then you go to the second way to extend your driving time.

2) The second way gives you two cars. You have 99 seconds to pass 39 cars. If, however, you lose your two cars or fail to pass the required number of cars in the time allotted, your game is over. If you do pass the 39 cars in the allotted time, then you will get another 99 seconds and so on.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Official Instructions (printed on bezel) :

- Lamp indicator signals game start.

- To win EXTENDED PLAY, pass 30 cars before timer counts down to "0".

- Spare player car is awarded for each EXTENDED PLAY, up to 4 cars.

- In first round, player car is returned to the starting line in case of a crash. In later rounds, However, a crash causes a player to explode.

Cars passed during EXTENDED PLAY add bonus points to the score.


* The Different Roads : As you drive along, you will notice that the roads and scenery change. If you

go through a couple of extended plays, the cycle repeats itself. Here are the roads in order of appearance : Starting City--Open highway with hills(1)--Seashore left side--Right curve--Oiltank right curve--Road toward city--Tunnel--Icy road--Tunnel--Open highway--Left curve--Oil tank left curve--Highway with street lights--Open high withhills(1)--Bridge--City--Open highway--Right curve--Left curve--Right curve--Highway with street lights going over water--Bridge(span)--Open highway--Open highway with hills(1)--Open highway--Right curve--Oil tank right curve--Open highway--Tunnel--Icy road--Tunnel--Highway with street lights goingover water--Open highway--Left curve--Oil tank left curve--Open highway--Open highway with hills(1)--Narrow highway--City on right--Open highway withhills(1)--Seashore right side--Right curve--Oil tank right curve--Seashore leftside--Tunnel--Icy roads with city on right--Tunnel--Open highway--Left curve--Oil tank left curve--Open highway--Open highway with hills(1)--Open highway--Bridge--Starting City


(1) It's actually one hill. The computer cars disappear briefly from in front of your car to reappear rather close giving the illusion of a hill in front of you.


* When you start the game, your car will be among other racers at the starting line. There will be both the graphic and sound for the countdown to start racing. Once the countdown is up, put it in gear and start driving. Get into high gear as quickly as possible. Not only will your score go up faster, you will pass the required number of cars quicker.


* A note about passing. You can pass all the cars you want, but, if a computer car passes you, your passed car counter goes down. The best thing to do is to maintain a steady speed since passing more cars then 40 doesn't add up more cars then can pass you.


* The steering wheel is very responsive on the game. Learn how to, in a controlled fashion, spin the wheel from side to side. It makes it a whole lot easier to maneuver your car around the other cars and you also have better control on the curves. On the icy roads, just maintain your direction and slow down if you have to. Remember, keep a light touch on the wheel and it will be easier to control your car then if you are clenching it.


* In order to drive effectively, you must know what you will be encountering next highway-wise. Look at ''The Different Roads'' to see the sequence of highways you must drive on. Forewarned is forearmed.


* When you see the yellow flag waving right under the Cars Passed display, that means an ambulance is coming. You can use the ambulance to your advantage for a couple of seconds.  The computer cars will clear a path so the ambulance can pass. Let the ambulance you and immediately get behind it. This should give you a couple of seconds of clear driving.


* Obviously, you can afford to be a little careless in the first part when your car just bounces off other cars and objects. You can still get the required cars for extended play. In extended play, however, you don't have this luxury anymore. Any contact with any object makes your car go up in a big puff of smoke.


* Be prepared for hazards in the road such as ice and puddles. Both of these can quickly cause your car to spin out thereby causing you to lose complete control of your vehicle.


* Drive on the shoulder if you have to but quickly get back on the main road. Also, downshift and upshift quickly if you slow down too much. It takes much longer to get back to speed if you are in constant HI gear then if you downshifted briefly to LO and then upshifted again.


* Since you don't have brakes, per se, on your car, just take your foot off the accelerator or downshift to LO to achieve the same effect. This is especially useful when you are approaching a pack of computer cars or are going around a blind curve (such as the oil tank). You may get passed by a couple of cars but it's better then trying to ram your way through and losing a car.

Turkey Shoot - The Day They Took Over (c) 07/1984 Williams.


The year is 1989, one year after the great gobble blight which plagued the world. One-third of the earth's populace was transformed by the ailment. The side effect of the turkey transformation is a tendency toward violence and comradery between these turkeys to organize for rabble-rousing in the urban areas. In February of '89, a group of specially trained agents (the turkey terminators) was formed for the sole task of destroying the turkey menace...


And so it begins. As a Turkey Terminator, the player is given 100 missions and 3 weapons to eliminate all the turkeys, leaving no 'left-overs'. He can take aim with his lethal laser gun using the position dot on the screen Screen-shot to hone in on his enemies with deadly accuracy. He can launch a lit grenade to annihilate all the turkeys within range or he can activate his gobble button (available one time each mission) to freeze all the turkeys for an instant, making them 'sitting ducks'. Missions are varied and include reacting quickly to clever ploys such as turkey air raids, turkeys disguising themselves as businessmen and turkey helicopter get-aways. Every 8th round is a rapid-fire bonus wave where the player has 15 seconds to eliminate as many criminals as possible. Shooting fire hydrants and trash cans as well as freeing bystanders who have been taken hostage also score bonus points.


Three 'fowl-ups' are allowed and occur whenever any turkey... a Pilot Turkey, Boss Turkey, Cyborg Turkey or Thug Turkey... escapes or when an innocent bystander... a businessman, shopper or policeman... is damaged.

Turpin (c) 1981 Konami.


Turpin is your standard maze game (one of dozens released in the wake of "Pac-Man"), with a few twists. The game begins by showing your turtle entering a building (a very early 'cut scene'), you are then presented with the first maze. Each maze has several boxes (with question marks on them), scattered around. You most open these boxes one at a time by walking on to them. Each box contains either an enemy bug (who will pursue you), or a 'KidTurtle'. The 'KidTurtles' are what you are looking for here. When you find one it will climb onto your back, and take it back to the turtle house which will be located in one of the corners. After you rescue a few turtles the game becomes more difficult because of the amount of baddies that you will have released, but luckily a star will appear in the center of the screen to help you out. Grab this star to gain land mines. You can drop these in the path of a baddie, and cause him to freeze temporarily (you can safely walk over frozen baddies). A new game screen starts after you rescue all the 'KidTurtles'. After 8 levels you get to watch a small ending sequence, and then the game starts over with increased difficulty.

Turtles came in an upright cabinet. This game used the standard 'Stern' cabinet that most Stern titles used, sideart was often just a painted 'Stern' logo on these. The marquee, monitor bezel, and control panel overlay all feature delightful cartoon turtle graphics in a very distinct style. The control panel has a single ball-top 4-Way joystick mounted in the center, with bomb buttons way off to each side.


Entex Industries released a boardgame based on this videogame (same name) in 1982 : It's each player's goal to rescue as many cute little turtlettes as possible and bring'em safely back to the home pond. But watch out for the evil beetles 'cause they're out to getcha!

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Flash bombs can only be used once per level, and remember you only have 3 available for the whole game. Use them sparingly, preferably only in a life-threatening situation.


* You can sit in a safe place close to a monster generator and simply pick the monsters off as they appear. Most monsters follow a set pattern of movement so it is quite easy to predict which way they will turn and wait in a place where it is easy to kill them as they appear in front or behind you. Remember to watch the timer though!


* The lanterns and rings are quite often a deadly diversion as they are sometimes placed in dead end vertical passages. Assess the risks carefully before collecting them.


* Be careful when entering vertical tunnels as you cannot shoot monsters on the other side until they are level with you in a horizontal direction.


* A carefully timed shot can kill a monster in a vertical tunnel, but only when fired exactly when the monster moves into the square in which you are stood.

* K.T. stores 6 characters for high scores.

* T.C. heros are Red and Blue for player 1 and 2 respectively.

* K.T. heros are grey for both players.

* T.C. dead remains of ground tanks are circular.

* K.T. dead remains of ground tanks always vary in shape.

* T.C. continues new hero and continued game at current position.

* K.T. continues new hero and continued game at predefined positions.

* After dying and your new hero appears, if you do not travel more than your helicopter length forward, you are penalised and moved back further when your next hero appears.

* K.T. Due to this difference in continue sequence, "Kyukyoku Tiger" is MUCH harder, challenging and nearly impossible to complete !

Twin Eagle - Revenge Joe's Brother (c) 1988 Seta.


A vertical shoot-em-up that places the player's helicopter against multiple attacking targets in the air, sea, and land. Collecting the weapon and speed power-ups throughout the game is vital since the gameplay is quite difficult.


The object of the game, which is not explained, is to avenge your brother (which means that you are Joe!). To do so, you must destroy the fortress on the very last level. When you start the game and it scrolls onto the starting screen, the background contains the different levels that you must survive. The starting position of the various enemies does not vary from game to game.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Power-up items :

1) M = Shot Multiplier

2) L = Slightly increased shot length

3) S = Slightly increased helicopter maneuverability

4) B = Extra bomb

5) Although it is ultra-rare, a floating icon can appear (instead of a baloon) which contains a full multi-shot powerup.


* Completely destroying the bunkers before shooting any of the men behind them almost always yields a shot-mulitplier power-up. One can regularly have the maximum number of shot multipliers by the end of the first level by using this trick. Power-ups seem to appear more frequently if you stay with your guns and do not pick up a missile power-up. Fire as often as you can when you are using the guns, and keep firing. Once you have maxed out your shot multiplier, it is good to start picking up missiles. Part of the trick to playing the game is to scroll the screen from side to side and to pick off the enemies that are placed on opposite sides to harrass you.


* By learning the pattern of when and where enemies appear, you can neutralize them before they can do you any harm. This is especially true with hitting the small helicopters as they come on screen, and nuking the screen just before the guided missile truck. It is best to use the screen nuke when your helicopter is positioned at the very bottom of the screen. Otherwise, it may only be partially effective.

Twin Bee (c) 1985 Konami.


An overhead scolling game starring a pair of bee-shaped robots, Twinbee (the blue one) and his female counterpart Winbee (the pink one), Twin Bee is part of what are called 'cute 'em ups', a slang for shoot-em-up games that feature cute characters, animals and other funny looking creatures, among other whimsical themes and brightly colored landscapes. It's a fun game to play with at least 6 stages that repeat themselves with increased difficulty as you go along.


Power-ups and extra points can be found in special bells hidden in some enemies that, when shot a certain number of times, will change color and then, when touched by the player, will provide a powerup, such as extra speed.

Twinkle Star Sprites (c) 1997 SNK.


An interesting & highly cute hybrid between a Vs style puzzle game & an overhead shooter, players may choose to play the Story Mode in order to see the misadventures of Load Ran & her faithful yet somewhat annoying Rabbicat as they try to find the Magical Twinkle Star & save their world from the evil Mevious & his henchmen, or play the Free Character Mode in which you are able to pick any character (see codes below to select hidden characters!) to play the game and see their very own comical ending. A second player may challenge you at anytime so you better put those skills to the test & have lots of fun!

- TRIVIA -


Developed by ADK.


Released in January 1997.


The game's concept seems to be a funny parody of the Sailor Moon manga, however the game's comic relief 'Rabbicat' seems to be a parody of Tenchi Muyo's very own cute mascot & comic relief 'Ryo-Oh-Ki' the cabbit.


Load Ran & Sprites feature different endings in the Free Character Mode, these endings are completely different to the one seen in the Story Mode.


In the story mode, Mevious will either taunt or praise you if continues have been used during your game or not!


Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Twinkle Star Sprites - PCCB-00247) on 21/02/1997.

Two Tigers (c) 1984 Bally Midway.


Two Tigers is a 2-Dimensional shooter. The game starts by telling you how may hits you must make on the ship before you can claim credit for sinking it. You then will go to the next screen which has your fighter/bomber in the middle of the screen. A gunsight will also be somewhere in the sky (the gunsight is actually the spot where anti-aircraft fire will be hitting at). Soon the sky is filled with enemy planes and a ship enters the screen from the left side. You mission will be to do whatever it takes to put the required number of holes into the enemy ship to sink it. You have at your disposal a single bomb and the enemy planes themselves for achieving your goal. Along the way, other things may assist (if you shoot them) such as mines and fuel drums. The game will go until you fail to sink 2 ships. If you are in 2-player cooperative mode, then the number of holes to sink a ship will be increased. The same rules apply, though, for sending it to the bottom of the sea.

- TRIVIA -


Released in July 1984.


Based on the novel 'Gus is my Co-Pilot'. It seems that war games were making their appearance around this time. Bally Midway was no exception in putting a war type game. Two Tigers is a loose conglomeration of several earlier games where the objective was to sink ships. Some games used submarines while others used planes. Although not a major success, it still created a following of dedicated players. Especially for the fact that it also allowed two-player cooperative mode and dogfighting.


A Two Tigers machine was shown at the 2003 classic arcade games show 'California Extreme' in San Jose, California.


- UPDATES -


Two Tigers dedicated version has significantly different gameplay and stuff...

Two Tigers Dedicated :

* Additional control 'speed'.

* Steering controlled by a pot with an A/D converter.

* Some stages occur at dusk, night, dawn and day.

* No crashes involve parachuting escapes except in between stages.

* Ships shoot from cannons.

* No plane engine noise.

* Background music was provided by a tape.

* Dogfight involves protecting your aircraft carrier from sinking by the opponent.

* Sea Level is close to ship.

* Game Designers Names apear in attract mode.

* Hero Table for Dogfight mode is shown in attract mode.

* Cloud graphics are repetitive.

* Ship has no wake.


Two Tigers :

* No speed function.

* Speed is constant.

* Steering controlled by an optical encoder on a spinner.

* Different interface locations.

* Ship graphics vary.

* All Stages occur during the day.

* All crashes include pilot escape with parachute.

* Ships shoot to crosshairs.

* Player planes have background engine sound.

* Different high score music.

* Dogfight involves shooting down the opponent's aircraft and avoiding the crosshairs.

* Sea level is halfway up the screen,.

* Only Bally / Midway appears in attract mode.

* There is no Hero table for Dogfight mode.

* Cloud graphics have middle line mirrored horizontally for better appearance.

* Ships have a wake.


- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is relatively simple but it is fast paced...

BOMB HIT ON SHIP : 150 Points

SHOT DOWN ENEMY PLANE HIT ON SHIP : 150 Points

ENEMY PLANE : 200 Points

DESTROYING A SHOT DOWN ENEMY PLANE : 250 Points

MINES, SWIMMER, SHARKS, FUEL DRUM : 700 Points

SUBMARINE : 1300 Points

HOLE IN SHIP : 1400 Points

DESTROYING THE SHIP : 5000 Points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


When you start the game, your fighter will fly in from the left side of the screen. There will be a slight delay then a ship will float in from the left side. Now it's time to put the ship on the bottom of the sea. These strategies are valid for both the one and two-player game. The only difference is that it takes more holes to sink a ship in the two player game and the second player comes in from the right side of the screen.


* It takes three hits in the same place to create a hole. It doesn't matter where else you hit, if you don't hit the same area three times, no hole is created in the ship.


* The best strategy for this game is to use your plane as a dive-bomber. There are a couple of reasons for this :

1) First, your plane goes faster when you are diving. This helps to prevent you from being brought down by anti-aircraft fire and enemy planes. Keep in mind, only the brown planes can collide with your plane.

2) Second, you can drop your bomb more accurately. Since you can only have one bomb on the screen at any given time, you have to make your bomb hits count. If you are climbing and drop your bomb, it will arc up over your plane before coming back down. In turn, this causes the bomb to take a long time to either hit the ship or miss. That bomb could be the difference between a ship sinking or getting away.

3) Third,  if your plane gets shot down (either by anti-aircraft fire or by collision with an enemy plane), you have a shorter route to travel before you reappear in a new plane. If you are climbing and get shot down, your character will arc above the plane and then his parachute will open. If your character parachutes from the top of the screen, you will lose a lot of precious time floating back to the water when you could have been pounding the ship into submission.

4) Fourth, if you look when your plane is either at the very top or bottom of the screen, a shield appears around your plane. Basically, your plane is protected when it enters the screen from the top or bottom to prevent it from being shot down. Use this definitely to your advantage.


* Use the enemy planes to your advantage. When you drop a bomb on a ship, it only takes out the piece of ship it hits. When an enemy plane is shot down and hits the ship, it will drill through the superstructure until it reaches the hull, then it will create the hole. This means, basically, you can actually sink the ship without using any of your bombs.


* During the first few ships, you will notice that mines float by the ship. These will make your job easier by taking out the ship from the ''bottom-up'' so to speak. When you destroy a mine under a ship, it blasts a three wide panel out from the bottom of the ship. That makes your job easier since now you only have work at putting two holes vice three to sink the ship.


* The later stages have fuel drums floating by the ship. Like the mines, fuel drums can help you put away a ship faster. When you destroy a fuel drum, it will put a hole in the ship for you.  In other words, instead of a lateral blast, it does a vertical blast through the ship.


* During the stages in-between ships, you can do target practice on either the submarine, swimmer and sharks, or mines.


* As the game progresses, the number of holes to sink a ship goes up. In addition, the anti-aircraft fire becomes more accurate and the enemy planes become quicker and more aggressive.


* In the dogfight game, both players try to shoot down all of their opponent's aircraft. The loser has to defend their ship against the winner. So obviously, you want to be the winner since it's easier to sink a ship then shoot down a plane.

Up'n Down (c) 1983 Sega.


Up'n Down is a 3-quarter perspective driving game. Your goal in this game is to collect colored flags. The colors are : Light green, white, blue, red, olive drab, green, magenta, yellow, and black. You must also collect these flags in a specific period of time in order to get the maximum bonus. To delay your trip, you will have to deal with other vehicles on the road. In addition, hazards such as potholes, bridges that are out, hills, and roads that abruptly will also test your skill on the track. As you progress through each round, more obstacles get in the way to keep you from collecting the flags and getting the bonus. Driving was never this challenging since dealing with rush hour in Chicago.

- TRIVIA -


Released during September 1983. By this time, Sega was starting to make a name for itself in the arcade industry. With solid hits such as "Star Trek", "Zaxxon", and "Pengo" under its belt, Sega started to venture into other areas. Sega had partnered up with Gremlin to create "Head-On" and "Head-On 2" arcade games. Later on, Sega released "Turbo". Using the same three-quarter perspective that was used in "Zaxxon", Sega created another racing game with a twist. Up'n Down came out during a time when the arcade market was basically saturated with space shooters.


- SCORING -


Jumping on a truck : 1000 points

Jumping on a race care : 2000 points


You also get bonus points depending on how quickly you finished the course. The times and points are :

0 - 19 seconds : 20000 points

20 - 29 seconds : 10000 points

30 - 39 seconds : 5000 points

40 - 49 seconds : 3000 points

50 - 59 seconds : 1000 points

60 seconds and above : 0 points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* You will start the game with your car on the track. There may be other vehicles also on the track. You goal is to collect all the colored flags in the least amount of time. You must first learn how the joystick works. Putting more pressure on it in one direction causes your vehicle to accelerate. Letting off the pressure causes your vehicle to eventually stop. This will become critical to know as you move into the later rounds.


* When you jump, make sure you have somewhere to jump to. The jump itself takes up about the distance of the length of your car. If there isn't enough room to land, your car will crash. This also happens if you jump off the road anywhere. If you want to jump on another car, then start preparing for it early :

1)  Make sure the road ahead is somewhat straight. Sometimes you can jump off a right diagonal road onto a left diagonal road and hit the car that way.

2) Another way is when you are one car length behind your intended victim, and the road is straight, then go ahead and jump on them.


* Sometimes you may have to jump over a car to avoid being hit. Again, make sure you have enough road to land on. It is very easy to try to quickly jump a car only to find yourself wrapped up in the pine trees alongside the road.


* Of course, the object of the game is to collect flags. If, for some reason, you cannot get a flag, there are a couple of ways to remedy this situation.

1) If it is safe (only works on the lower rounds), you can backtrack to where the flag is. You cannot, though, go past the bottom edge of the screen.

2) If you go through three screens, the course will ''wrap'' around and you can get the flag on the return. The only disadvantage to this is that it is time consuming.


* Do not make blind jumps. If you can't see where you are jumping to, go up a little further to see your destination. If you don't, you may end up jumping into something such as a destroyed bridge, abrupt road ending, or the road curves and you jump off the road.


* Make sure you know where the hills are. If your car doesn't have enough speed, it will only go halfway up the hill before it rolls back down again. While it is rolling, you lose control over it.  This can be dangerous when other cars are coming up behind you.


* In the later rounds, other cars will be coming at you both from the front and rear. Some of them travel faster then others sometimes creating a situation where you will be in between two cars traveling opposite directions and heading straight for your car. Again, make sure you know how to accelerate and decelerate.


* Whenever you jump from one road to another, your car will automatically face toward the top of the screen in the direction of the road. You don't have to wait to move again. This can be especially handy when trying to avoid other cars or trying to get flags.


* I'll state the obvious of not getting a flag if there is too much congestion around it. Since the timer is not displayed, you probably don't know how much time you have taken to get the flags. Just go around the course and try again. Better to save a car then sacrifice it for points then realize you took too long and don't get any bonus.


* Keep on the lookout for what cars do what. Such as trucks usually follow along the road at a leisurely pace while race cars can go fast or slow and with or against the flow of traffic.


* As you progress in each round, the course becomes harder because more hazards are added to it.


* "Pengo" : Pengo makes a guest appearance in this game if you manage to pass the first four rounds in under a minute each. The penguin will appear in the water of round five riding a surf-board.

Released in December 1992.


This game is known outside Japan as "Grind Stormer".


This would be Ikeda Tsunemoto's first game at Toaplan. He went on to become a founding member of Cave, where he still works as a lead programmer. It is due to him that the phenomenon of the ''Danmaku''; the huge walls of bullets seen in "Donpachi" etc, came about.

Jumping Enemy Car : 100 points.

Destroying Enemy Car : 1000 points.

Bonus Balloon : 500 points for each remaining balloon.

End of level bonus : Extra points awarded for time remaining.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Van Van Car is not a hard game, but it will have you pounding walls, the controls, or younger siblings in frustration. Be prepared to die a lot of very stupid deaths, particularly when you're learning the game. The game is about minimalist control - try to avoid making sudden movements or jerky motions, as you'll generally end up accidentally switching tracks or losing speed and being rammed. Also try to avoid twitch jumping when enemy cars are close - while in the air, you have no control over your car, so enemies will run right underneath you, and they do not make for a soft landing. Try to plan a path and move smoothly through the maze, avoid sharp turns, and jump cars coming head on only. If you're being pursued closely, look for a break in the maze that you can jump over and gain an extra second or two on your pursuer. DO NOT try to turn and jump. You're asking for a crash.


* The bonus balloon appears when there are eight balloons left on screen. Try to collect it without bursting any more balloons as they are worth a total of 3,500 points when you collect the bonus.


* Try to save your missiles to fire them in a long straight line picking off as many balloons as possible, and hopefully destroying more than one car.


* Don't collect another energy balloon until you have fired the missile awarded by the last one, otherwise the second missile will be wasted because you can only carry one at a time.


* Enemy cars cannot pass through balloons; they have to go around them. This can be used to the player's advantage as the player can jump on a balloon while being pursued by an enemy, and the enemy has to back off and go around.


* When you fire a missile, and an enemy car is turning near the axis you fired on (but is not actually on the axis) the missile will destroy the car, even though it technically does not hit it!


* Enemy cars do not beeline for you automatically. Only after popping a certain quota of balloons (or perhaps by taking a certain amount of time) do they start coming directly for you. Therefore, for the first little while in a level, you have time to plan out which balloons you need to go for immediately and which you can save for later. You also want to save your missiles for when enemy cars are actually chasing you - not merely idling around the maze.


* It's important to note that some tracks can be deceptive - balloons will cover up key turning points, making it appear that there is straight road where there are actually curves. These are good balloons to take out early on in the maze when you aren't being heavily pursued.


* Oil slicks are a useful item in the game. Since you speed up by running over one (although you can't jump, you gain about 2x your normal speed while spinning), they allow you to make a quick escape from enemies, particularly when said enemy is right on your tail.


* The game repeats itself after 12 or 14 levels, starting back on level 1 and slowing down considerably.

This is a scrolling space shooter (some levels are horizontal, some are vertical). Shoot down enemies with your laser. Keep a close eye on your ever decreasing fuel gauge, luckily each enemy that you destroy will add to your remaining fuel. Find the energy pods to be temporarily invulnerable), the energy pods will also increase your fuel level. At the end of each level you must defeat a boss that is guarded by two moving force fields with holes in them. The computer will then announce the name of the next zone using some nifty early 80's synthesized speech.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* When you start the game, your fighter, will be at the left side of the screen. Keep in mind, this is a scrolling game. This means you can go no faster then the right side and no slower then the left side. You can, however, vary your speed in-between by pushing the joystick back and forth. The biggest key in getting through this game is learning how to use the joystick to speed up and slow down because you will sometimes be put into some very tight areas that will require precision joystick control. Here are some strategies for getting through them. There is no break between the areas, but you can pretty much tell what area you are in by the landscape and/or the enemies.


CAVE ZONE : This zone is pretty straightforward. The cave is wide enough for you to maneuver out of harms way.

1) There should be no reason that you can't go through both areas energized. The energy stations are abundant in the cave zone.

2) The Harley's like to group up in packs of five or six. They will fire on you and an occasional Harley will break from the pack to try to ram your fighter. They usually stay on one level and don't move around a lot. Very easy to evade.

3) The Mist's are a different matter. They move around all over the area and they are rather difficult to hit. You will have to use your lasers from different sides very effectively.


RAINBOW ZONE : In these zones you will be going diagonal up or diagonal down. The first part only has three aliens while the second part of the zone has six aliens moving up and down.

1) On the diagonal up parts, get your fighter in between the second and third aliens during the first part.  Reverse this on the diagonal down parts.

2) On the second part, you will have to get in between the fourth and fifth aliens. You may have to use your top laser to clear out the alien above since the top three alternate with the bottom three. Reverse this on the diagonal down parts.


STICK ZONE : There are no energy stations in this zone so you will have to do some quick maneuvering and firing in all directions. This area also narrow significantly. Use the same tactics from the Cave Zone.


STRIPED ZONE :  You only have to deal with ground targets in this zone. This, though, is the problem since those targets are clustered very close together.

1) You should be able to go through this area energized since energy stations are abundant in the lower parts of this zone.

2) If you aren't energized, make sure you decided quickly to go high or low. If you go high, you deal with bases and Garines (bouncing aliens). This can be rough if you mistime it. The bottom has more targets but you must destroy the barrier. You do this by destroying the upper or lower stand that fires it up.

3) This zone lasts a while but the pattern remains the same.


BLEAK ZONE : You will be going up instead of sideways. The scrolling now is you can't go faster then the top of the screen or slower then the bottom of the screen.

1) Enemies on this screen are actually pretty easy to get through. Just stay in the middle and keep firing. The Romeda may give you trouble since they like to fire left diagonal shots.

2) If you go into the debris left from the Kemlus, a backward 'C' will surround your fighter and you will get 1090 points. You can do this three times. After the third time, if you try this, your fighter will be destroyed.


DOCKING ZONE : This is for all the marbles. There are many hazards to avoid as you try to take out Gond.

1) First, as you enter there are lasers to your left and right. You must quickly get into the second part. Gond is protected by two layers that have openings. These openings line up for only brief moments. Try to take shots through this opening.

2) After a short amount of time, walls will close behind your fighter. You only have a limited amount of time because there are five walls and if they close before you take out Gond, you lose your fighter.

3) The only good thing is if you fail to take out Gond, you advance to the next round. Of course, you don't get the bonus for Gond.

4) After you make it through each set of cave one and cave two, the action gets faster.

Vendetta (c) 1991 Konami.


Evil is lurking in Dead End City. In a turf war, the Dead End Gang has kidnapped Kute Kate from the rivals, the Cobras. The Cobras set out to save her and stop the expansion of the Dead End Gang in Vendetta.


The Dead End Gang is looking to expand their territory, so the Cobras must infiltrate every area around the city. First, they must gain entrance to Dead End City. Relying on their fighting skills, the Cobras face a multitude of enemies. However, each member is up for any challenge from the Dead End Gang. The Cobras are a powerful team consisting of : Blood, an ex-prize fighter; Hawk, a former professional wrestler; Boomer, trained in the martial arts; and Sledge, an ex-military convict. Together they must destroy members of the Dead End Gang to get to the leader, Faust, who knows where Kute Kate is being held.


With fists of fury, the Cobras make their way through various areas of Dead End City. They search the construction site for Kate, battling the humanic weapon The Missing Link to gain information. From there, they are sent on futile chases through other sections of the city, including downtown, the waterfront, and the slums, where the final confrontation with Faust takes place. Throughout the game, the Cobras can pick up special weapons and food for more energy. Each player also has his own 'special attack' method to help defeat the toughest enemies.


Once Kute Kate is rescued and Dead End City is liberated, the Cobras victoriously start back to their home turf. However, much to their surprise, the entrance to their town is blocked by Dead End Gang bosses. The Cobras must gear up once more for the ultimate showdown to restore peace to Dead End City.

Venture (c) 1981 Exidy.


Venture is a 1- or 2-player "Gauntlet" style game (although Venture pre-dates the Atari legend by 4 years) set in a multi-level dungeon. The player, armed with a bow and arrow fights through enemy infested levels in the quest to collect treasure.


Each dungeon is represented as a floor plan, populated with a number of "Space Invader" like monsters. Numerous rooms and their corresponding doors are clearly marked; these rooms are the treasure rooms and each one must be cleared. When the player enters a room, the viewpoint zooms in on the action and the room takes up the whole screen. Each room has a treasure or weapon guarded by one or more creatures. Players must try to retrieve the treasure while avoiding (or killing) creatures and obstacles. Only in the rooms themselves can players use their bow and arrow.


When the treasure is successfully taken out of the chamber, bonus points are awarded. The screen image then returns to the original, zoomed-out floor plan and the player moves on to the next room of their choice. Once a room has been cleared of its item, the player no longer has access to that room. The player must collect all of the treasures on the current level before descending to another dungeon.

- TRIVIA -


Released in June 1981.


Venture came in a white dedicated cabinet and featured sideart of Winky battling green monsters (looks like snakes).


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


A) If you wont to change aim without moving, learn just to tap the joystick, not to jam it.


B) When pursued by hall monsters outside the dungeons, don't waste time by shooting them. Reverse direction, switch from side to side, and do whatever else you must to escape.


C) Do your best not to shoot a monster where its corpse might block your path to or from the treasure. If you do, you have no choice but to wait until it has completely disintegrated; under no circumstances should you shoot it again.


D) Because you want to get out of each dungeon quickly, you should waste no time in picking up the treasure. It can and should be done in one fluid motion. The Instant you touch the loot, you should start thinking about getting out.


E) When a hall monster appears outside a dungeon, leave. Even if it is outside the room's only exit, remember that it won't be there when you get outside-although another might.


Once the half monster has actually entered the dungeon, the best policy is to flee in the opposite direction. If there is no exit there or a corpse is blocking it, it is still possible in the first three levels for a skillful Winky to escape around the hall monster. It's a risk but do it if you have to.


F) When leaving a dungeon, look out. You don't want to run straight into a waiting hall monster. The more time you've spent in the level so far, the more you should worry.


G) The question of whether to shoot dungeon monsters when you don't absolutely have to depends on two factors : speed and accuracy. If you think you can kill several in a short time,do it. Keep in mind the bonus at the end of each level, since that determines your final score. Unless you are very fast, there is no point in risking the decrease of your score by a seventh or a sixth for a few hundred points.


H) Since you Start in the same place on the level each time, it makes sense to clear the dungeons nearest you first. If you can make a circuit of the level without being killed,the strategy will save time. If you are killed and have to start over,you will have to take the same long route you avoided before.


I) In The Wall Room, don't bother shooting your way through the red walls. It's a risk that earns you no points and takes more time than simply slipping around them. Since this dungeon Is the easiest, it should probably be saved for last, when you need to finish quickly.


J) In The Serpent Room, send arrows down on the two lower snakes before you enter their territory. Their length will make them easy targets from that angle.


If pressed for time enter and exit the dungeon through the door in the right wail, avoiding a confrontation with the third snake.


K) The Goblin and Skeleton Rooms should be handled according to your inclination. You can easily evade the monsters, but the points you could gain with a few parting shots should be considered.


L) Save The Two-Headed Room for the end of Level Two, since it is a very quick job once you have the secret. When you don't have time to shoot the crabs and then to wait for them to disintegrate from your path, split-second timing alone will get you out safely. The instant you touch the treasure,jam the joystick to the upper left. Each time, you will barely make it past the crabs and out the left head of the room.


A more lucrative and time-consuming method is to stay at the bottom with your treasure and wait for the crabs to drift down from the heads into the body in search of you, as they invariably do. If you shoot well, you can kill them and still leave a clear path out. If a hall monster appears before you finish though, say goodbye to Winky.


M) As soon as you enter The Troll Room, move about an inch to the left of the entrance, staying as low as possible : aim to the upper right. As soon as the walls vanish, one goblin will come thundering down since he doesn't sense that you're aiming at him. Diagonal shots are your best chance against any of the monsters,but the trolls are particularly tricky.


Shoot as soon as he leaves cover, then move up and get the treasure. The remaining troll will not be had to evade If you are fast.


Whenever you do aim vertically or horizontally,the trolls will not give you a chance to hit them, holding you in stalemate until the hall monster shows up. What you must do (if you don't want to shoot diagonally) is aim in some other direction until your target has committed himself to attack. Then quickly shift your aim and fire before he has a chance to dodge.


N) You must kill almost everything in The Dragon Room; there is no room to maneuver around the dragons while they are all alive and moving. Even if you are a skillful archer, you must take special care to shoot so that you still have a clear path to and from the treasure. If you have to wait for the dragons to disintegrate before you can reach it, you might as well forget about it. 


O) The red denizens of The Spider Room win always stay near the treasure in the center; they shift around it to follow you. Shoot one for best results : it takes almost no time and you can easily snatch the treasure from only two defenders.


The instant you do, look out for the two yellow spiders. They will close in on you rapidly,and your only chance is to duck under one and escape while you still have time. Once you reach the door, a couple of arrows shot at your pursuers won`t hurt.


P) With each new level, be prepared for greater and greater challenges. Try to view each dungeon creatively to find the best strategy.


VENTURE is one game in which it is not only important but vital to watch more experienced players, observing the game`s many unusual problems and the different ways of handling them. Good luck!

Vigilante (c) 1988 Irem.


A sequel to Irem's legandary 1984 beat-em-up, "Kung-fu Master", Vigilante sees the hero's girlfriend, Madonna, kidnapped by a gang of thugs and driven away in the back of their van. The vigilante must fight through five enemy-packed levels to rescue his girlfriend. As with "Kung-fu Master", a tough guardian enemy awaits the player at the end of each level. The guardians must be defeated as quickly as possible as their energy bars will replenish in between the player's attacks.


A weapon, in the form of Nunchakas, can occasionally be found and picked-up; adding to the player's 'kick' and 'punch' fighting moves. Some of the game's many enemies are also armed, with either clubs, chains, knives or guns. The game ends once Madonna is rescued.

When you start the game, you'll see two elephants that the ship takes off from. On top of that they closely resemble Hindu drawings from India. The background for this game is based on a thousand's of years old book called the mahabarata that is regarded as a bible (sorta) for millions of Hindu's in India. When you read some of the verses in it you'll find funny descriptions of vehicles that the gods used that closely resemble modern aircraft of today. They are called Vimana's that carry *magical* axes and spears :). The mahabarata also describe what appears to be a technological war with missiles, nukes and huge flying fortresses and something which could be interpreted as radiation poisoning! The ancient Babylonian and Indian civilizations have often been an interesting pool for speculation and creative thinking regarding alien interference on earth in ancient times...

Vindicators (c) 1988 Atari Games.


As team commander of the SR-88 Strategic Battle tanks, you must face the evil invading forces of the Tangent Empire. They're invading the galaxy with 14 space stations designed to defeat your team. Turrets and highly mobile armoured tanks are constantly on patrol to protect the fortifications that Tangents have built.


With limited suppiles and weapons, you must make a last stand and attempt to defeat the invaders. The most powerful weapon in your arsenal is the SR-88 Battle Tank, but their fuel supply is very volitile. You must constantly replenish its fuel by picking up fuel canisters throughout the stations' many levels.


Battle stars can be found along the way. These are vital to enhancing your tank and adding weapons. Process generators can convert the battle stars into powers and weapons while in transit between levels and stations. Only with these customized tanks can the evil Tangent Empire be conquered.


As you defeat each station, demolish its control room and take the supplies the fleeing Tangents have left behind. Proceed in their mothership to the next station for another battle.

Released in April 1988. 1988 was quite a year for Atari and tank games, since they also released "Assault" that very same year.


The Vindicators dedicated cabinet is a real favorite among some arcade game collectors. This is probably due to its unique shape, it is shaped a lot like a tank, with tank treads holding up the bottom section of the cabinet. The top half is decorated with sticker sideart that shows scenes from the game, and these same graphics generally carry over to the control panel and the front of the machine. The control panel features four tank handle controllers.


A Vindicators machine was shown at the 2003 classic arcade games show 'California Extreme' in San Jose, California.

Vulcan Venture (c) 03/1988 Konami.


The third game in Konami's renowned "Gradius" series; the prequel being "Gradius" (known as "Nemesis" in Europe) and a spinoff called "Salamander" (also known as "Life Force"). Vulcan Venture strictly adheres to the shoot-em-up template set out by its hugely successful predecessor, the game eschews the sideways/vertical scrolling alternate levels of "Salamander" and opts instead for "Gradius" sideways scrolling-only mechanic. Vulcan Venture is rightly considered to be one of the most demanding and difficult shoot-em-ups ever released.

Vulgus (c) 1984 Capcom.


Vulgus is pretty simple. You just pilot a spaceship and blast countless enemies. That is what is fun about this game. There is nothing complicated, just pure blasting. You only have two weapons, your blaster, and a limited supply of bombs. This title uses the time honored top-down vertically scrolling format. The background moves eternally forward, but you can move all around the screen, and can make the screen scroll both left and right. Your enemies consist of an assortment of fairly realistic looking spacecraft, some of which have a distinctive 'insectoid' look to them. This game is endless and it doesn't seem to have a level format. You just move forward and shoot. The backgrounds will change from time to time from planetary surfaces to space scenes and eventually they will start repeating once you blast this particularly large alien formation.

- TRIVIA -


Released in May 1984.


Vulgus is the first game produced by Capcom. Capcom, a name derived from 'Capsule' and 'Computer'. Kenzo Tsujimoto established the company in Japan as a manufacturer and distributor of electronic games machines.


In space shuttle terminology, CAPCOM also stands for 'Capsule Communications'.They are responsible for most of the talking to the shuttle during the missions. They relay all the messages to and from the shuttle. It's a very important, very stressful position in the space flight system.


Vulgus was only available as a conversion kit from SNK (or Capcom in Japan). The marquee to this title was red and it had a strange blue 'Vulgus' logo that had red veins running through it.

The US version's high score table allowed three initials to be entered. The Japanese version allowed ten letters to be entered.

WEC Le Mans 24 [Big Spin model] (c) 1986 Konami.


A demanding yet superb sprite-scaling racing game from Konami, based on the annual 'WEC Le Mans 24' race; a grueling event that, as its name suggests, takes place over a 24-hour period.


The width of Le Mans' racetrack never varied and remained a constant 3 lanes wide. The track itself was incredibly demanding and contact with either a rival racer or one of the many track-side objects would send the player's vehicle flying dramatically through the air, costing valuable seconds in time.


- TECHNICAL -


WEC Le Mans 24's 'Big Spin' cabinet rotated on a central spindle. The results were highly effective, if a little disorienting.

- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1986.


Also released as :

"WEC Le Mans 24 [Mini Spin model]"

"WEC Le Mans 24 [Upright model]"


WEC Le Mans was released the same year as Sega's seminal "Out Run" and tends to be unfairly overlooked in the annuls of video game history. The sprite-scaling and use of color is superb with the game-play being tight and responsive - if a little on the difficult side. Le Mans asked rather more of the player than Out Run, adopting more of a 'simulation' approach to its game-play - but patient and skillful players found their efforts suitably rewarded.


Reflecting real-life motor-racing sponsorship, Le Man's racetrack is lined with billboards advertising recognized cigarette brands, such as 'Gitanes' and 'Lucky Strike'.


The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'HHH'.


Apollon Music released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Original Sound of WEC Le Mans 24 Arcade Version - BY12-5027) on 21/08/1987.

Lex Luger - Lawrence Pfohl

Doink - Matt Borne (1st), Steve Keirn (2nd), Ray Apollo (3rd), Steve Lombardi (4th), Dusty Wolfe (5th).


The filming for characters must have been somewhere between July and September of 1993 judging by the appearances of the wrestlers in this game.


About fatalities : The original plan was for all 8 wrestlers to have finishing moves, but once the WWF got wind of it, they ordered Midway to not put anymore in.


The World Wrestling Federation is now known as World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), having lost a lawsuit with the World Wildlife Fund over the use of the abbreviation WWF in 2000. The company changed their name to WWE 2 years later.


At the time of the game's release, the WWF Champion was Diesel (Kevin Nash) who is absent from the game. However, at the time of the game's development, the WWF Champion was Yokozuna, who was a WWF Tag Team Champion at the time of release, his tag team partner Owen Hart (1965-1999) is absent from the game.

Wacko (c) 1982 Bally Midway.


The game is a colorful single screen shooter, with excellent graphics for the time. You maneuver 'Kapt'n Krooz'r' around the screen in his spaceship. The terrain is an orange moon scene, various cartoonish monsters dot the landscape. You must blast the monsters in pairs to make them vanish. Later levels introduce even more complex rules as to what can be shot. You control your ship with the trackball, while using the joystick to aim and shoot. The controls feel natural with a little practice, but the game quickly becomes very difficult on the higher levels.

- TRIVIA -


The game originally had a wizard shooting at cute animals but Bally/Midway execs thought it was too cute and needed an edge. Monsters were designed by Scott and put in instead, plus Bally/Midway also called him at the last minute to replace the wizard with the little green alien from Kozmik Kooz'r. The slanted cabinet was an idea by Marvin Glass which required the trackballs to be installed upside down to work properly.


This title takes the prize for having the strangest dedicated cabinet ever made The Wacko cabinet is sloped, both the control panel, and the marquee are set at an angle. The right side of each being about three inches lower than the left side. This means that the joystick and trackball are both at an angle. This is the only machine ever made to feature a sloped control panel (a distinction which it will probably keep for a long time).


A Wacko machine was shown at the 2003 classic arcade games show 'California Extreme' in San Jose, California.

- TRIVIA -


War of the Worlds (or WOTW for shorts) is based on the HG Wells science-fiction classic.


WOTW was one of the last vector games Cinematronics created. This game was meant to be a 3-D vector version of "Space Invaders" but was never released due to it testing badly at the 1982 AMOA show. Less than 10 were made. They were all sold to distributors and sold at trade shows. The game did not generate enough interest to be put into production. The reason this game never went into wide production was twofold. The first reason was that it was simply too easy. Games that are too easy don't make a lot of money. The second reason was that the hardware simply wasn't good enough to run the game, it lagged a bit from time to time, and arcade games are not supposed to lag.


One interesting note is that the game was originally made with the B+W X-Y monitors, but a couple years later, it was resurrected with a color monitor around the time of "Solar Quest". Only one or two where made this way, and it is doubtful that they still exist.


The 'War of the Worlds' conversion kit came with a red and yellow marquee that had a fairly simple game logo on it. The monitor bezel showed the curved surface of an orange planet, along with some generic outer space stuff. The control panel has graphics showing a ruined city, and the legs of several giant martian walkers. The controls are all pushbuttons, no joysticks or anything like that at all. The game came with a plastic monitor overlay meant to give color to the black and white monitor, it made the upper and lower areas red, while the center area was yellow (it also had a hand drawn city scene way in the background).

If done correctly, Pyros should slowly inch his way underneath the two platforms and can then grab the cape without any problem.

The player may choose when to warp to a different world, so it is possible to continue playing in the same world throughout the game. In Space World, the character uses a gun to shoot up enemy aliens, and in Maze World, aliens are killed using a time-delay bomb. The delay is controlled by the length of time the button is held down, and the player loses if the character is caught in the resulting explosion.


Power-ups may appear on some levels, and allow the player to shoot exploding bullets or attach bombs directly onto enemy aliens. However, the exploding bullets usable in Space World can only obtained in Maze World, and the power-up to attach bombs onto enemies in Maze World only appears in Space World. Players must alternate turns on the screen in the multiplayer mode.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


Special Attack : Attack+Jump


Every character can perform his own special move by the combination : Down, Up + Attack


Press Down+Jump to perform a dash-attack spin against the enemies.


During the game, sometimes you'll found a "gong bell" that will summonate the Horse for the player.

The Horse gives great offensive attacks against the enemies, and also gives to every character a long-rage weapon (despite Kadan): also, some characters that didn't carry any weapons normally (Portor and Kassar) will get it after they'll go up the horse.

Every charcater can perform some special moves when is ride the horse: 

* standard Special Attack (press attack+jump): You'll lose energy every time you'll perform it. 

* Powerful slash with special wave: backward, forward + attack. Can slice apart some enemies. With Kadan you'll obtain a fire bolt.

* Dash: forward + Jump: is also possible combine the attack button to perform a longe range attack after the dash (despite Kadan)

* Run ans Slash: every direction (backward or forward) + jump (2 times rapidly): this move is similar at the standard special, but the player will not lose energy for perform it, is possible moving while using it, and the enemies can be hitted more of one time in this way: although, some enemies are able to block this attack, if they'll hit the player.


Sometimes, the horse will be used even by some bosses, and the player can get it after the boss will get down. By the way, some bosses are able to use the horse too, and they can benefit og theyr usage like the players.


Violent Boss Kill : if you'll finish the boss with a special move, you'll execute him in a very brutal way. Most of times the boss will be sliced apart, but you can also decapitate him with determinated moves.

Water Ski (c) 1983 Taito.


In this timed abstract racing game, a single player controls a water-skier who is being pulled along behind a power-boat. The objective is to complete the course in as fast a time as possible to reach the next course, while avoiding rocks, sharks, motor boats, wind surfers and numerous other obstacles.


The player can move their skier left or right, and can press buttons to either slow the boat's speed or to jump over obstacles. Small rocks are the most common obstacle and can either be avoided or jumped over. As well as the small rocks that litter each course, there are also ocassional large rocks; these cannot be jumped and must be avoided at all costs. Also, players must be watchful of the direction their tow-boat takes them otherwise they risk being dragged into oncoming obstacles or having their tow-rope snapped on one of the large rocks.


As well as obstacles, each stage also contains one or more large jump ramps. To make a successful jump, players must ensure they hit the bottom of the ramp with their ski-board facing directly forwards. At the top of the ramp players must press the JUMP button, which will propel them from the end of the ramp to make a perfect landing in the water below. Making a successful ramp jump awards the player with bonus points, but if a player fails to hit the bottom of the ramp properly, they will crash and lose valuable seconds.

Willow (c) 1989 Capcom.


Willow is a sidways scrolling platform shoot-em-up game loosely based upon the movie of the same name. Players take on the role of one of two characters: Willow Ufgood or Madmartigan. The hero's mission is to rescue the baby Elora Danan from the evil Queen Bavmorda and bring her back safely. If the quest fails, the Queen will plunge the world into darkness and chaos.


The game consists of 6 levels, each representing a scene from the movie. Defeated enemies drop gold coins that can be collected by the player. In addition, each level is littered with locked treasure chests that can be shot open and the treasure within collected. The gold can be used to purchase a number of weapons and character power-ups from a nearby shop (represented on screen by a wise old man). All power-ups will stay with the player until all lives are lost and the game is over.

- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is relatively hard since there are a lot of things you can get points for. Also, you get money for many of the monsters you kill. This money, though, will only remain around for a couple of seconds so you have to be quick to pick it up. Here is the scoring table :

Archer : 50 Points - 10 Golds

Axe Thrower : 200 Points - 10 Golds

Bat : 200 Points - 10 Golds

Devil Dog : 100 Points - 10 Golds

Eagle : 200 Points - 10 Golds

Fish : 200 Points - 200 Golds

Projectile thrower : 1500 Points - 100 Golds

Snake : 50 Points - 10 Golds

Snowball : 100 Points

Soldier : 50 Points - 100 Golds

Spear Thrower : 500 Points - 100 Golds

Troll : 500 Points - 100 


The Bosses :

Sorcerer : 500 Points - 200 Golds

Devil Dog : 7000 Points - 10000 Golds

Sergeant Claw : 2100 Points - 400 Golds

Wizard : 6500 Points - 10000 Golds

Dragon : 10000 Points - 1000 Golds

Sorsha : 15000 Points - 10000 Golds

Two-headed Dragon : 20000 Points - 10000 Golds

Kael : 10000 Points - 10000 Golds

Bavmorda : 0 Points - 0 Golds


In addition to the above, you can get money or items from the treasure chests. Attacking the chests is enough to open them.


You will receive a bonus at the end of each stage. The bonus comes out to be :

1) Time (in seconds) x 100 x Stage Number

2) Life (in bars) x 100 x Stage Number


I.E. : For Stage 2 you had 1:31 in time left and three bars of life, your bonus would be :

91 seconds x 100 x 2 = 18200 points for Time

3 bars    x 100 x 2 = 600 points for Life

Grand Total Bonus : 18800 points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* The Bosses : There are nine bosses to deal with in this game. Watch the Boss Vitality meter to see how much damage you are doing to them. As you damage them, they will lose a bar off the meter.


SORCERER (Vitality unknown) :

1) First, get off the bridge and onto the cliff. This will make the battle easier to fight.

2) Basically, just keep firing in his direction and jump to attack when needed. When he attacks, just jump over his spells.

3) This will take a while but keep pounding on him and you will send him back to school.


DEVIL DOG (Vitality : 4) : At the end of Stage I, a sorcerer appears telling you to turn back. To prove

his point, he magically makes a regular Devil Dog grow to huge proportions.

1) The main attacks the dog makes are its flame breath and claws. You must keep mobile at all times to avoid the effects of these.

2) When the dog crouches, it is read to release a hot-breath torrent. This is the time to jump up and make your shots count. The pooch will flash every time a hit is scored.

3) The fire rolls along the ground so you may have to jump a couple of times to avoid it. Don't get too close to the paws or the dog will claw you.

4) Continue to watch the dog crouch down and attack. Eventually, you will have housebroken the animal.


SERGEANT CLAW (Vitality unknown) : At the middle of Stage III, you will be on an island. Follow the gnome's advice regarding this boss.

1) When the Sergeant is standing up, none of your attacks will affect him. It is only when he is crouched down and attacked can you hit him.

2) You will have to power jump (diagonal + jump) over him to avoid his claw.

3) Continue to attack between his attacks when he is crouched down. Eventually, you will take him out.


WIZARD (Vitality : 10) : This is the boss you have to deal with at the end of Stage III.

1) He has two major attacks. He will use fire demons and fire attacks on you.

2) The fire demons can be eliminated with regular attacks. You must, however, jump over the fire attacks which tend to cause a splash effect.

3) This boss spends most of his time in the air so you will have do power jumps in order to attack him. Just watch out for the fire demons he launches.

4) Continue this pattern and you will defeat the Wizard.


DRAGON (Vitality unknown) : This is the boss you deal with halfway through Stage IV.

1) This bosses main attack is its fire breath. It will either hover over your character or shoot flames from an angle. The object is to keep moving so you don't get toasted.

2) The Dragon tends to fly in a pattern. It will stay high for a while, then it will swoop down to attempt to claw your character. Use of the power jump is strongly recommended.

3) You can get in three to four hits between fire breaths if you time things right. In addition, if you are under the Dragon, you can get in an additional one or two hits.

4) Keep moving around and striking and this Dragon should be dinner before you know it.


SORSHA (Vitality : 12) : This is the boss at the end of Stage IV.

1) Sorsha's main claim is that she is fast and she is very nimble on the jump. The best attack is to trap her on a side and go to work.

2) When you have Sorsha near a side, attack rapidly to prevent her from getting in an attack. After she loses a couple of bars of vitality, she will jump out of the way.

3) Pursue her and get her trapped again. Watch out for her counterattacks since they can be rather devastating.

4) Continue this pattern to finish her off.


TWO-HEADED DRAGON (Vitality : 16 per head) : This is the boss at the end of Stage V.

1) You will be on a wooden bridge while both heads assail you with their fiery breath.

2) The heads tend to fire at the same time. After they have fired, get up there and get in a few whacks.  Because there are two heads, your hits will usually be spread out between them. Don't worry about going for a specific head right now.

3) The heads will bob back and forth. If you want to go after one head, then you must wait for the target head to be in front of the other one.

4) Power jumps will definitely save you on this one. Back up and when the heads fire, power jump over the rolling fire to get your attacks in. Watch out for the heads dropping suddenly since that usually means a bite attack.

5) Continue this pattern to finish the critter off.


KAEL : (Vitality : 16) : This is the boss near the end of Stage VI.

1) Kael is a very tough warrior. What he lacks in maneuverability he makes up in attack power.

2) As with Sorsha, try to corner him along the edges so you can pound on him. He does, though, have more of a tendency to jump straight up to another platform, then try to get behind you. Watch for when he jumps up.

3) Continue to move around and trap him on the edges and this powerful warrior will be sent packing.


BAUVMORDA (Vitality : 23) : This boss is the final boss of the game.

1) This is probably one of the toughest bosses you will ever have to face. Bauvmorda has quite an arsenal of attacks that can devastate your character if you're not ready. Follow the gnome's advice regarding protection.

2) Bauvmorda has a variety of attacks, some of them are :

a) She attacks with little crystal-like objects that rotate around her.

b) She attacks from above with fire.

c) She animates a BBQ grill thing when she is down to about 10 vitality. This thing attacks in conjunction with Bauvmorda's attacks.

3) During her crystal attacks, you will be doing a lot of power jumping. Try to get in shots where you can since there is little room to move between the crystals.

4) When Bauvmorda goes airborne, power jump up to attack her. Watch out for the objects that burst into flames. She will tend to go back and forth across the top.

5) When the BBQ grill gets animated, make sure you keep track of it since it is also attacking along with Bauvmorda. It takes too much time and firepower to destroy the grill. Time better spent tearing into Bauvmorda.

6) Continue with this pattern and the world will be safe again.


You will start the game at Stage I (unless you are continuing). You will only have a basic attack and your wits when you start the game. In addition, each stage is timed so you will not only have to beat your enemies, you will also have to beat the clock. The only good news is that if you die, you don't lose any items or upgrades either on your continues or next man. Listed below are the Stages.


STAGE I. Crossroad (Character : Willow)

* Head right until you get to the bridge. Climb up the cliff and cross the bridge. Go to the end and climb the cliff.

* Open the treasure chest for 200G then head to the left. You will see a couple of stone pedestals and a treasure chest at the end. Go over and collect 100G, then head back to the right.

* At the end of the cliff, drop off and you will be next to a gnome. Time to shop. After you exit the shop, go right across the bridge and you will have to tangle with the Sorcerer.

* After that battle, go right to the treasure chest and collect the Holy Water. Then go down the mountain.

* At the bottom, on a ledge is another gnome. Go chat with him. After you exit the shop, go to the right. Be quick since the rock will sink under your weight.

* Keep going right and at the end you will have to deal with the Devil Dog.


STAGE II. Cherlindrea's Forest (Character : Madmartigan)

* Go right until you get under a balcony. Jump up and head to the left. Go all the way left to open the treasure chest and get the 200G.

* Go back right and get onto the next balcony (3rd level). Go left to get the next treasure chest of 100G then head right again.

* At the end of the walkway, fall off onto a ledge with a treasure chest to get 100G. Drop down to ground level and head right.

* Enter the shop (press up on the joystick) to do your business. Then exit and head right.

* Go up to the next level then power jump across the two sets of stairs. Continue to climb to the top and go right.

* Jump off the balcony and onto the cart. Your job is to now defend against the soldiers, archers, devil dogs, and eagles dropping rocks.

* After an adventuresome ride, the stage will end.


STAGE III. Fin Raziel's Island (Character : Willow)

* Go up the cliff and head to the top left to chat with the gnome. After you are done shopping, go back down the cliff and head right.

* Upon the next two terraces are treasure chests. They each contain 100G. Finish climbing the mountain and to your right will be a series of stone pedestals.

* You will have to cross eight pedestals, each at varying heights. In addition, eagles will be around to make your journey that much harder.

* The second to last pedestal will sink down, make sure you jump off it to the next one. That one will sink also so quickly jump off it to the island. It's time to deal with Sergeant Claw.

* After you take care of the good Sergeant, a stone platform will connect the island you're on to the next island to the right. Go all the way to the end and chat with the gnome.

* Hop into the boat and cross the sea. Be ready for a hard fight with the soldiers, archers, and fish.

* At the end, you will tangle with the Wizard.


STAGE IV. Sorsha's Camp (Character : Madmartigan)

* This stage starts with Madmartigan going up a hill. You will not only have to deal with the soldiers, but also snowballs that are rolling down the hill. At the top of the hill is a gnome. Heed his words about the dragon.

* After chatting with the gnome, you will go downhill again. Open the treasure chest for 100G and proceed right into the cave. At the end is the Dragon.

* After clearing out the dragon, jump up to the next platform and go left. Talk to the gnome. When you exit, continue to head right and jump up on the cave roof. Then power jump left and go to the end.

* You will see a brownie suspended in mid-air. Go over and get him down. From now on, you have an ally who attacks whenever you change the direction you are facing. The brownie's attacks can be quite devastating.

* Go back right and follow along the path. You will pass many tents so be prepared for a big fight with soldiers, spear throwers, and archers. The brownie should greatly help you out.

* Sorsha will be at the end waiting, take her down then jump on the sled with Willow. At the end of this track, make sure you jump to avoid the boulder.


STAGE V. Tir Asleen Castle (Character : Willow or Madmartigan (some players prefer Willow due to distance attacks))

* Head right until you get to the wall. Go up to the next level and get the Holy Water from the treasure chest.

* Head left until you get to the gnome. After doing your shopping, head right again and climb up to the next level.

* Go right to the door and press up to enter the next hallway.

* The main danger here are the walls that drop and the soldiers pushing spiked blocks toward your character. You will need to be quick with the trigger finger to get through this hallway.

* At the end of the path, cross the top platforms to reach the gnome in the upper, right corner.

* Go down and around the spiked pits. You will be heading to your left. Collect the 100G from the treasure chest. At the bottom, head right.

* Go across the wooden bridge to tangle with the Two-Headed Dragon.


STAGE VI.  Nockmaar Castle

* Head right. On the 2nd upper platform is a treasure chest containing 100G. Press up at the end of the walkway to enter the door.

* Keep going right and you will encounter another gnome. After chatting with him, you are faced with a pit of spikes. To the right, you will see a small wooden ledge. Timing is the key to this part. You will have five seconds to jump to the next wood ledge to the right. Do this until your reach the other side.

* Again, another bed of spikes awaits you. The ledges exist for about three seconds now. Cross over and you will be in front of two doors. This is the start of the maze. Going through the wrong door puts you at the beginning of the area it connects to. Go through the left door. The right door will put you back through this first area again.

* In this area, you will be cross pits with spiked ceilings that will descend into them. Again, timing is crucial to prevent damage. You will cross over several of these before you reach three doors. Take the left door. The middle door puts you back into the first area and the right door will make you do the second area again.

* The third area consists of two levels. Both are equally dangerous since you have the soldiers pushing the spiked blocks. Due to not have a ranged weapon, you may need to power jump over these guys. Continue to the right and you will encounter four doors. Two on the top and two on the bottom. Take the upper, right door. The upper, left door leads to the second area; the lower, left door leads to the first area; and the lower, right door leads back to the third area.

* You will tangle with Kael to get through this area. Go through the door and you will change over to Willow.

* Climb the platforms in front of you. You may have to power jump on a few since they are too high to just do a regular jump. Watch out for the projectile and axe throwers in this area. At the top platform, chat with the gnome to do your final stocking up. Then go in the door to deal with Bavmorda.


After you take her down, the credits will roll and your game will be over.

This game is known in Japan as "Flying Power Disc".


Each characters in game has his own native language (i.e. Costa says ''Perfecto'').


Windjammers contains 2 mini-games. After the second match, Dog Distance consists in catching the disc as far as possible with your dog. After the fourth match, Flying Disc Bowling allows us to make strikes and spares with the flying disc.


Windjammers is based on the real world flying disc sport called '10-S'. But the inventor of the 10-S has never give permission or signed any agreement to allow Neo Geo or Data East to use 10-S as a model for Windjammers. It have never been compensated for the illegal use of 10-S rules and method of play. 10-S was created in 1977 and copyrighted in 1980.

* Remember the positions of the four bonus items when the level starts, as collecting the crown and killing all the monsters when stunned is worth a lot of points.


* At the early parts of each level, concentrate on killing the monsters singly, clearing a path into their territory and waiting around a corner to stun them.


* When the monsters start homing in on you, move to a large safe area away from them and then make your way to a carpet, waiting for as many monsters as you can.

Wizard of Wor (c) 1980 Midway.


Welcome to WIZARD OF WOR! In this magical game, you are a worrior descending into deep dungeon mazes, battling invisible monsters, cacodemons, and maybe even the Wizard of Wor himself! Be of good cheer, worrior, for herein lie many of the secrets of the Wizard.


Wizard of Wor is a game for 1 or 2 players. When the 2-player mode is selected, both players control their worriors at the same time. Teamwork in the 2-player mode is very important (but not necessary to play).


The object of Wizard of Wor is to descend as far into the dungeons of Wor as possible, killing monsters, beating the Wizard, and earning as high a score as you can. The game ends when all the players' worriors have been destroyed.


At the start of the game, you are placed in dungeon one. It contains six blue Burwors. Using the joystick and fire button, maneuver your worrior around the maze and shoot them. As you shoot the last Burwor, a yellow Garwor will come out. Garwors and red Thorwors will turn invisible. The radar will show the positions of the invisible monsters. Invisible Garwors and Thorwors will become visible when they enter the same corridor that a worrior is in. As time goes by, the monsters speed up. The longer it takes before you shoot them, the faster they go. When you have destroyed the Thorwor, the first dungeon ends.


In the 2nd dungeon, a different maze is randomly selected. Once again, 6 Burwors are placed here. More Garwors and Thorwors will appear this time, however. When the last Thorwor has been shot, Worluk will come out and try to escape out one of the side doors. If you shoot him before he escapes, all point values will be doubled in the next dungeon. After Worluk has been shot or has escaped, the Wizard of Wor may then appear. He teleports closer and closer, continuously firing lightning bolts. He continues to do so until either one worrior has been destroyed, or the Wizard has been shot.


After dungeon 3 or 4, a bonus player is awarded (option switch selectable). You must then face the Arena. This is the toughest of the lower level dungeons. The Worlord dungeons begin at dungeon eight. They are very difficult to survive. At dungeon thirteen, another bonus player is awarded, and you must try to win your way through The Pit. The ultimate goal of Wizard of Wor is to survive The Pit without losing any worriors.


In a 1-player game, the other worrior (blue) is your friend. He will not shoot you unless you come between him and a monster, then he will try to shoot the monster, and you could be hit by his shot.

In a 2-player game, both players play at the same time. They do not take turns. The two players may elect to shoot each other. But, if you wish to survive for long, you must use teamwork!


And now worrior, go forth and do battle with the Wizard of Wor!

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


The game progresses through a series of dungeon mazes, each one deeper in the caverns of Wor. One other worrior accompanies you into the dungeons, and if you wish to survive for long, you should work with him to conquer the monsters you will encounter. At the start of each dungeon, there are blue Burwors moving around the maze. As you destroy them, yellow Garwors come out, and as you destroy them, red Thorwors take their place. When the last red Thorwor is shot, winged Worluk comes out (not in the first maze). Try to shoot him before he escapes out one of the side doors, as that will double all the point values for the next dungeon. After Worluk has escaped or been shot, the Wizard of Wor might show up. He uses a powerful teleport spell to jump himself from place to place in the dungeon, all the while firing lightning bolts. He keeps reappearing until one worrior has been destroyed, or he himself has been shot. If any worriors are left, the next dungeon is entered. This sequence of events continues until all of the player's worriors have been vanquished.


In the basic dungeons, a worrior can learn the fundamentals of survival. It is very easy to walk blind around a corner, into the mouth of a waiting monster. When the monsters are really moving, they are faster than you are. This makes running away difficult. There is a point where you will have to turn and fight them before they eat you.


Your worrior is easy to operate - a 4-direction joystick for movement in the dungeons, and a fire button for the concentrated unified-field-disturbance rifle. The joystick has two contacts in each direction, a direction contact and a movement contact. A light tap to the joystick will face your worrior in a certain direction, without moving him out of position. To move your worrior, just hold the joystick over in one direction.


The unified-field-disturbance rifle is easy to use. It fires in the direction your worrior is facing. It operates on the principle of a concentrated unified-field-disturbance area coupled with a displacement through 4-space. This means that it can create only one disturbance at a time, and the disturbance must continue moving until it expands its energy on some object, usually a monster or a wall of the dungeon.


Only one shot can be in the air at a time. This means that in a short corridor you will be able to fire rapidly, because your shot will always quickly encounter a wall. In a long corridor, the shot stays in the air for a long time, leaving you in hot water if a monster is approaching from the side.


If your shot occasionally seems to go in the wrong direction, it is because your worrior has not fully rounded a corner before firing. Your shot went in the direction you were just facing, not in your new direction. Learning when not to shoot is an important part of the strategy of this game.


Entering the dungeon is simple to do, but at times, particularly in the Worlord dungeons, choosing the right time to enter can be a little tricky. At the start of each dungeon, you have ten seconds to bring your worrior into the maze. To do so, just push the joystick toward the maze. When your worrior comes out, he is facing the radar screen. If you do not bring the worrior out of the ready box immediately, the ten second count-down begins. The numbers of the count are shown next to the ready box. At the end of the ten seconds, your worrior will automatically be brought into the dungeon. At the beginning of a dungeon, all the monsters are started away from the 2 ready boxes. But since the monsters move randomly at first, they can start to move closer to you. Also, when a worrior has been destroyed, you may immediately bring a new worrior into play. However, monsters might be milling about next to your ready box. To avoid being eaten, wait for the monsters to clear the area before bringing your worrior out. It is important to note that a new worrior can be brought in at any point during play. If you get eaten or shot, just bring in another worrior and have at it! This is particularly useful with Worluk, who may eat you once, but not escape immediately. It is often possible to bring a second worrior in, and kill Worluk for double score on the next dungeon, before he escapes.


In a one player game, the blue worrior is controlled by the computer. He is a first in video gaming, as he is your friend inside the machine. He will never shoot at you, he shoots only at monsters. Sometimes, he will even save your life by shooting a monster sneaking up behind you. Be careful not to get between him and a monster, for he will still try to shoot the monster, and you might catch his shot.


Teamwork is also a major point of strategy in Wizard of Wor. In the basic dungeons, there are places where two worriors can cut off the monsters as they try to enter the corridor where the worriors are standing. This position is strong but not invincible. The monsters, particularly the last few monsters left in a maze, are moving fast enough to occasionally duck in between shots, and eat you. Back to back in a short corridor is good teamwork. Note that the two worriors can pass through each other unhindered. But be careful! When you are close together, it's very easy to accidentally shoot each other.


In the early mazes, it is to your advantage to initially go out and shoot as many monsters as you can. This is because the monsters move slowly at first, but get faster later. The more slow monsters you shoot, the fewer fast monsters will be left to eat you. When the monsters speed up, then find a good teamwork spot. In the upper level mazes, the Worlord dungeons, the critical thing is to not miss a shot, for if a shot misses a monster, it is likely to travel a long way before hitting a wall, and in that time a monster will probably come along and eat you. In some of the Worlord dungeons, there are places that two worriors can defend effectively, but they are very hard to get to, and often one player might loose a worrior trying to move into position. When you reach the Pit, you're on your own...


There are 2 levels of overall difficulty in the dungeons - basic dungeons and Worlord dungeons. In addition, there are 2 special dungeons, the Arena and The Pit, which occur at special times during play.


Each dungeon consists of an 11-by-6 matrix of squares, with a wall or opening on the sides of each square. The maze is symmetrical around the center vertical axis. Every maze has a side escape door located four squares up from the bottom, and on each side of the maze. Going out the door on one side brings you in the door on the other side. This can be confusing at first, but becomes quite handy when you get used to it. After using the side escape door, it remains closed for a short amount of time before reopening.


When Worluk is out, the door always remains open. Proper use of the side escape door will sometimes aid in escaping trouble, and can also help to cut off Worluk before he escapes. The basic dungeons consist of many short passages with many possible different pathways, and some long corridors. At first glance, the long corridors appear to be the most strategic spot, but this is not true. Due to the firing mechanism, it is usually the most dangerous spot, as you are not able to fire very often. Finding good places for team work is relatively easy here. In the area between the radar screen and the dungeon, a description of some current important aspect of the game is displayed. In dungeon one, the word RADAR is shown, indicating to the novice player the function of the radar.


On other dungeons, the level of the current dungeon is indicated. When Worluk comes out, the word WORLUK is displayed there, as is WIZARD OF WOR when he shows up. It tells when either of these has ESCAPED. And it tells when DOUBLE SCORE has been earned for shooting Worluk. It also tells you of THE ARENA and THE PIT.


Below the bottom of the dungeon is the radar. This shows you the location of every monster in the dungeon, visible and invisible. It is important to learn to use the radar to anticipate a monster coming from behind. The only creatures that do not show on the radar are the worriors and the Wizard himself. When you have reached dungeons eight and above, you have become a Worlord. Now you have the honor of testing your skill in the Worlord dungeons. These dungeons are much tougher, there are fewer walls and more open spaces. If even one shot misses, and travels the long distance down to the opposite wall, a monster will very likely come up and gobble you down. Finding and establishing yourself in solid strategic positions is very difficult. It is easy to have several worriors chomped up in a row. Sometimes the monsters will line up along one edge of the maze - a lovely parade. However, if just one monster starts approaching from the top, watch out!


The Arena is the dungeon that comes when the 1st bonus player is awarded. Since the bonus player is switch selectable for the fourth or the fifth maze, the same switch will also control the appearance of the Arena. It is the most difficult maze of the basic dungeons, featuring an arena. This is a large open area in the middle of the dungeon, with openings level with the side escape doors. This is a preview of the Worlord dungeons and The Pit.


Surviving The Pit is the ultimate goal of Wizard of Wor. The Pit occurs at the 13th dungeon, and every 6th dungeon thereafter. In other words, the 19th, 25th, 31st, etc. dungeons are The Pits. One missed shot here is almost certain to be fatal. The Wizard is particularly deadly here, as there is nowhere to hide. A bonus player is awarded at the first Pit. The other Pits do not award a bonus player. Sophisticated maneuvering, intestinal fortitude (guts), and a bit of luck are needed to make it through The Pit unscathed. Surviving The Pit without losing a worrior earns you the title of Worlord Supreme. Best of luck!


The Wizard of Wor loves to hear the patter of little feet running through his dungeons. So he created some lovely beasties, known as Worlings. Burwor is beautiful, bouncing blue. 6 of them exist on each dungeon level. They always remain visible. This is because the Wizards favorite color is blue. As each Burwor is shot, a Garwor may come to take his place. Garwor is kind of overfed, and waddles a bit, but he has yellow scales that are just delicate. As Garwors are shot, Thorwors are teleported in to take their place. Thorwor is sleek and dangerous red.


All of these monsters can shoot an occasional lightning bolt. Only Garwor and Thorwor have the Wizards spell of invisibility. They become visible when they enter the same corridor as a worrior, and when they are initially teleported in.


In the 1st dungeon, when the last Burwor is shot, he is replaced by a Garwor. When a monster is placed in the dungeon, it is at a random location, somewhere away from both worriors. In the 2nd maze, the last 2 Burwors are replaced by Garwors. The progression continues until the sixth dungeon, when all six Burwors are replaced by Garwors. Whenever a Garwor is shot, he is replaced by a Thorwor. So, in the first dungeon, there are a total of 8 monsters : 6 Burwors, 1 Garwor, and 1 Thorwor. In the 2nd maze there are a total of 10 monsters : 6 Burwors, 2 Garwors, and 2 Thorwors. In the 6th dungeon, there are a total of 18 monsters : 6 Burwors, 6 Garwors, and 6 Thorwors. This is the maximum number of monsters in 1 dungeon level. Note that there are really no more than 6 monsters in one dungeon at any 1 time. It just seems like there are more.


All of the monsters work on a speed-up timer. This timer increments the speed of the monsters every time it counts down, which is about every seven seconds. A Garwor that replaces a Burwor will start at the speed the Burwor was going when destroyed. The same is true for Thorwors. So, in the early mazes, Garwors and Thorwors end up going faster than Burwors, although, given enough time, Burwors can get moving as fast as any monster. In dungeon 4 and before, any monster traveling at top speed will always be visible. In later dungeons, Garwors and Thorwors will still become visible at top speed. In dungeon 7, the Burwors start at top speed. Any monster traveling at this speed is not able to shoot lightning bolts.


Worluk... the Wizard's favorite : In the 2nd dungeon and beyond, Worluk will come out after the last Thorwor has been shot. Worluk is a lightning quick Cacodemon. He's the Wizards favorite. He flies erratically through the maze, trying to reach one of the side escape doors. The Wizard tried to train him to fly to the door on the opposite side of the maze that he is initially teleported to. However, Worluk's chaotic nature leads him to frantically fly about, sometimes flying out the side escape door closest to him. If you shoot Worluk, all the scores in the next dungeon are doubled. This means that killing Worluk is essential for high scores. A good strategy is to position your worrior by the door that Worluk should use to escape. If Worluk should eat your worrior, bring the next one immediately into play, and go after him again! Remember, he is worth double score on the next maze. But, at the moment that Worluk has been shot, beware worrior! For it is then that the Wizard of Wor might choose to appear.


The Wizard of Wor : Even at a young age, the Wizard showed promise in the mystic arts. But it took many dangerous encounters and many years of research and study to sharpen his skills to his current high level. Over the centuries, the Wizard has retained his chaotic sense of humor, much to the chagrin of worriors entering his dungeons (see the list of phrases).


The Wizard will sometimes come out after Worluk has been shot. He uses multiple teleport spells to pop around the dungeon, eventually homing in on one worrior or the other. All the while, he wildly fires lightning bolts in every direction. At first he teleports some distance away from one worrior. Then, on successive teleports, gets closer and closer. Note that if the two worriors are very near each other, the Wizard may teleport right next to one of them the very first time. This is because he was teleporting a certain distance away from the other worrior, and happened to come up right next to the first worrior.


The Wizard will continue to teleport and fire lightning bolts until either one worrior has been destroyed or the Wizard has been shot. Shooting the Wizard does not kill him; it only banishes him until the next dungeon. In almost every dungeon there is a possibility that the Wizard could show up. This possibility is based on the level of the dungeon you are currently in, and on the total number of worriors left in the game. However, even at the highest dungeon level, it is not certain that he will appear.


Standing in a long corridor when the Wizard is teleporting in can be quite risky. If he comes up in that corridor, he will have a clear shot at you.


As you get deeper into the dungeons, the Wizard stays for a shorter period of time, and teleports even faster. This means he gets closer a lot faster, so you must try and shoot him soon after he first comes out. Otherwise, he may end up teleporting right next to you! The Wizard loves to fool worriors by teleporting behind them. But watch out, he will also surprise you by popping up right in front of you.


The Wizard says, 'Scores of 150,000 or more are exceptional'. Now, you're off to see the Wizard, the magical Wizard of Wor.


* Hints for game play :

1) Take a quick look at the maze before you go into it. Know the locations of the monsters and also find areas that will be suitable for defending yourself. The Burwors will already be roaming around. In the later levels, a couple of Garwors and Thorwors will also be in the maze.

2) When playing in 1-player mode, the computer player will assist you to a degree. Use this to your advantage. This will be especially true in the later levels when the invisible monsters are roaming the maze. The computer player can help you by making them become visible. Keep in mind that you can kill off the computer Worrior and they can do the same to you.

3) Two-player works like one player. Learn to work together and try not to kill each other (unless you are playing a cut-throat competition).

4) It is easier to turn from side to side then it is to turn from side to up/down. Find the short walls that will only allow monsters to approach you from the side. Also, align your warrior just a little past the corridor walls above and below. This will give you the advantage of seeing invisible monsters in two vice one passageway.

5) Another advantage of the above is the fact that the monsters will push you back vice kill you. Of course, you must get back into position since the monsters seldom will attack you singly in the later dungeons.

6) Learn to tap the joystick so you can rapidly turn without moving your Worrior. This will prove invaluable on the later levels when you have to turn back-and-forth rapidly to shoot the enemies coming at you.

7) Learn to use your radar. Although it doesn't have the maze superimposed upon it, you can get a pretty good idea of where the invisible monsters are and where they are moving to. This will definitely help decrease the chance of being surprised by one of them.

8) When you are shooting, make sure you are making your shots count. You can only have one shot out at a time. This basically means that until your shot hits a wall or a monster, you have no firepower. So don't fire down long corridors or you may find yourself surrounded by monsters without being able to shoot them.

9) Your shots can also be negated by the other Worrior's shots, monster's breath weapons, and the wizards lightening bolts.

10) As the dungeons progress, the monsters become smarter. Not only do they attempt to surround your character, they also move out of the way when you are aiming at them. In addition to becoming smarter, they move much quicker and tend to swarm on your Worrior.

11) You can use the warp tunnel once during a dungeon. It will also clear out when the Worlock appears.  When you use the warp tunnel, it will seal off behind you as you get to the other side. Only use it when you really need to. Don't hang around it since the monsters will also use it to get to your location.

12) The Worlock will appear after the last monster has been killed. Worlocks usually appear in the center of the maze and move toward one of the war tunnels. Try to seal off the warp tunnel to prevent the Worlocks escape. Also, hit it at long range since trying to fight toe-to-toe with it would be suicide.

13) After you clear out the Worlock, you may be confronted by the Wizard of Wor himself. The Wizard of Wor teleports randomly about the maze shooting off lightening bolts. This may be the one time when a pre-emptive shot may do you some good since the wizard may teleport into your shot. You can also use the same tactics of creeping out from behind a wall with the wizard since you won't be hit until you are pushed back into the corridor.

14) If you survive through dungeon 7, you will now be classified as a Worlord. This basically means all the monsters are moving at maximum speed and they are all coming for you.

15) If you don't lose a Worrior on the dungeons with the Pit, you will be classified as a Worlord Supreme.

16) For the mazes that are open (such as the Pit) or very near open (such as the Arena), go to a corner to present the smallest possible target and to force the monsters to only come at you in two directions.

17) While you are playing the game, if you turn the power off and back on quickly, you will start where you left off and your total amount of Worriors left will be at their maximum of 16.

18) After the dungeon counter (located above the radar) passes 100, it will reset but the 1st digits will no longer by in synch with the counter.

19) It is rumored that if you fire a shot and the Wizard of Wor first appears in the exact same spot where your shot is, the game will lock up.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* This game has hidden coins that appear when you jump in certain spots. The demo screen shows a couple of these. Some of them will give you 60 gold or more every time.


* How to get 60+ golds from hidden coins : Besides the general strategy of quickly wiggling the joystick right and left while jumping (which raises the chance to get 60+ golds), certain coins, in certain places within the game, will ALWAYS yield 60+ golds if you perform particular actions :

1) Round 2 : On the screen after you kill the Vampire, there's a platform with a Shoe Shop and some stairs which lead downwards to an Infirmary. Wait for the little mushroom to go down the stairs, and stand so that you are almost off the topmost stair. The mushroom will come back up and hit you, making you fall off the stairs. Hold the joystick to the left so that when you land you walk into the bottom step. This will drop a 60+ coin. NOTE: This trick only works if you haven't bought any shoes yet.

2) Round 3 : On the stage after you kill the Red Knight, you'll see some jellyfishes on platforms over the water. At the first jellyfish you come to, wait for it to drop into the water, then lean out of the platform putting yourself on its trajectory. The jellyfish will hit you, and you'll get a 60+ golds bag. NOTE: This trick is shown during the attract mode.

3) Round 3 (Baraboro) : Climb the ladder to the platform where the Shield Shop and Catherine's window are located. Once you're atop the ladder, let the mouse hit you. You'll fall leftwards, triggering a 60+ golds bag.

4) Round 6 (Pyramid) : Beneath the platform where the Infirmary is located, there are some spikes. Approach the spikes as much as possible, then hit jump and fire at the same time, and keep hitting them every time you land. Some coins will start to fall from the platform and head towards you. If you'll keep a pace as much regular as possible, many of those coins will yield 60+ golds.

X-Men [2-Player model] (c) 1992 Konami.


6 X-Men travel to Asteroid M in order to end Magneto's reign of terror.


- TRIVIA -


Released in April 1992.


X-Men is based upon the comic book series of the same name (most of the game's plot is loosely based on the 1989 X-Men cartoon called 'Pryde Of The X-Men'). Here are the debut comics for all Marvel characters from this game including non-playable characters :

Cyclops (aka Scott Summers) - X-Men #1

Colossus (aka Piotr Nikolaievitch Rasputin) - Giant-Size X-Men #1

Wolverine (aka James 'Logan' Howlett) - Incredible Hulk #180

Storm (aka Ororo Munroe) - Giant Size X-Men #1

Nightcrawler (aka Kurt Wagner) - Giant Size X-Men #1

Dazzler (aka Alison Blaire) - X-Men #130

Professor X (aka Charles Francis Xavier) - X-Men #1

Shadowcat (aka Katherine 'Kitty' Pryde) - X-Men #129

The Sentinels - X-Men #14

Bonebreaker - Uncanny X-Men #229

Pyro (aka St. John Allerdyce - Level 1 boss) - Uncanny X-Men 141

The Blob (aka Fred J. Dukes - Level 2 boss) - X-Men #3

Wendigo (Level 3 boss) - Incredible Hulk #162

Master Mold (Level 4 boss) - X-Men #15

The White Queen (aka Emma Grace Frost - Level 5 Mid-Boss) - Uncanny X-Men #129

Juggernaut (aka Cain Marko - Level 5 boss) - X-Men #12

Mystique (aka Raven Darkholme - Level 7 boss) - Ms. Marvel #16

Magneto (aka Erik 'Magnus' Lehnsherr - Final boss) - X-Men #1

In Nightcrawler's ranking screen, his name is misspelled as 'Nightcrowler'.


Although "Final Fight" set the standard for scrolling fighters. Konami's X-Men created several innovations for the genre, including the ability to hit fallen opponents to prevent them from getting back up, as well as a character-specialized 'mutant power', which could clear the screen of enemies, but also reduced the player's health. The game is fondly remembered by those who played it for its fun, addicting game-play and colorful graphics. However, it is also sometimes criticized for its wooden voice acting and often ungrammatical script ('I am Magneto, Master of Magnet').


Bill Toups holds the official official record for this game with 830 points on 06/11/2004.


King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami All Stars 1993 - KICA-9016, 9018) on 21/12/1992.


A X-Men unit appears in the 1998 movie 'The Replacement Killers'.


List of official models :

X-Men [2-Player model]

X-Men [4-Player model]

X-Men [6-Player model]


- UPDATES -


Differences between the 2-Player Japanese version and the US version :

* The introduction cut-scene and some of the other animated cut-scenes contain Japanese subtitles.

* During game-play some sentinels appear with a white and pink coloring, if you defeat them, you can pick up either an energy power-up or a mutant power-up ball

* Whenever you use a mutant power attack, you'll use up a power ball before losing energy for using another attack. in the US version however, you lose energy first, then you'll be able to use a power ball.

* Stages 1 and 4 start a little bit ahead of the US versions.

* The robot pterodactyl that is a mid-boss in stage 4 appears a lot earlier in the Japanese version.

* The US versions have the 'Winners Don't Use Drugs' screen.


Due to certain issues, both the 2-player and 4-player cabinets, a rare occurrence, had character selecting, while the 6-player cabinets forced the selections.

- UPDATES -


A handy thing about the 6-player versions is a longer screen ratio. This is handy for the fact that there is more physical screen space for the play-field, making some fights easier, since you are not trying to see enemies off-screen so often, and allowing Konami to do the correct feel for the cut-scenes, since they didn't have to 'chop' the sides off the animated parts.

- TRIVIA -


Released in July 1987.


The word 'Xenophobe' (pronounced 'Zee-no-phobe') is a psychiatric term meaning 'fear of aliens'. Programmer Gary Oglesby contributed this name.


The game earned so much money during first weeks of testing that the programmer was pulled off the game to work on a pinball project.


Xenophobe was a highly original game with a highly original concept. It was the first split-screen game. It was also a victim of a production scheduling snafu. Due to its production being pushed ahead, a lot of the game's tuning was axed. There are many objects in the game that the player can pick up, but have no use.


Brian Colin & Jeff Nauman originally conceived this game with a tomb-robbing treasure hunting theme, but when programmer Howard Shere was assigned to the project, his love of science fiction prompted the shift to an ALIEN spoof.


Michael Ward holds the official official record for this game, on Medium setting, with 2,500,000 points on 06/11/2004.

Xevious (c) 1982 Namco.


The player pilots a combat aircraft called a 'Solvalou' which is armed with a forward-firing gun for aerial targets, and bombs for destroying ground-based targets. A red targeting square is situated in front of the Solvalou, which allows the player to aim their bombs accurately. The enemy craft appear in a number of different guises; from the standard variety that arrive in large numbers but shoot slow-moving projectiles, to exploding black spheres that shoot projectiles at high speed. There are also rotating shields that cannot be destroyed and must be carefully avoided. Ground enemies are a combination of both stationary bases and moving vehicles, most of which fire slow-moving projectiles. A gigantic, floating fortress (called 'Andor Genesis') appears in certain areas; this is defeated by knocking out its core.


Xevious is actually divided into 16 different areas, which are separated by an area of forest. If a player dies before less than 70% of an area has been completed, play restarts at the beginning of the same area; should a life be lost AFTER 70% of an area has been completed, however, play restarts at the beginning of the next area. After area 16 has been completed, the game loops back to area 7.

- TRIVIA -


Released in December 1982.

Licensed to Atari for US manufacture and distribution (January 1983). Approximately 5,295 units were produced by Atari.


Xevious IS NOT the world's first vertically scrolling shoot-em-up but has a huge and lasting influence on the genre. Xevious was the first games to use pre-rendered graphics and, among its countless innovation, was also the first vertically shoot-em-up that allowed accurate targeting of both air-born AND ground-based enemies. The graphics were hugely revolutionary for their time; the sprites were rendered with remarkable clarity and detail due to the game's clver use of colors and shades as well as palette-shifting. Xevious was also the first game to feature 'hidden characters', which, being hidden, are not mentioned in the game's instructions but can be revealed by performing a secret maneuver. Among these was the 'special flag', which gave the player an extra life. This feature was carried over to a number of subsequent Namco games.


While Xevious enjoyed limited popularity in the U.S., the game was a huge cult hit in Japan, and to this day is considered one of the greatest video-games of all time. Popular Japanese musicians, Haruomi Hosono (Yellow Magic Orchestra) and Kuwata Keisuke (Southern All Stars) were known to be fans of the game, and the former produced an album of music from Namco video-games; with Xevious as its centerpiece. A follow-up 12in. single featured in its liner notes an entire science-fiction short story by Endoh, set in the world of Xevious, with even included a rudimentary fictional language.


At one point in the game, the Solvalou flies over the Nazca lines. The Nazca Lines are geoglyphs (drawings on the ground) located in the Nazca Desert; a high, arid plateau that stretches thirty-seven miles between the towns of Nazca and Palpa, situated in the Pampa region. They were created during the Nazca occupation of the area, between 200 BC and 600 AD.


CAST OF CHARACTERS

AIR UNITS

The graphics ROMs contain several additional enemies which don't actually appear in game-play including a silver-grey Galaxian flagship. These enemies do appear in the game-play of "Super Xevious" which uses the same graphics data as Xevious.


The highest score possible is 9,999,990, at which point the game terminates abnormally and resets. Some time before this score is reached, the game starts to award extra ships on every blaster shot fired.


Marco Borroni holds the official official record for this game with 7,009,560 points (!) on 08/16/1984.


The background is actually one large 1024x2048 image. Each of the 16 game areas is a 224x2048 strip starting at a different horizontal offset in the image.


Two bootlegs of this game are known as "Xevios" and "Battles".


In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battlezone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".

- TIPS AND TRICKS -


When you start the game, your Solvalou will be at the bottom of the screen. Keep in mind, this is a scrolling game. This means you can go no faster then the top and no slower then the bottom of the screen. You can, however, vary your speed in-between by pushing the joystick up and down. The biggest key in getting through this game is learning how to use the joystick to speed up and slow down because you will sometimes be put into some very tight areas that will require precision joystick control.


* One interesting aspect of this game is the fact if you are too successful against a particular kind of enemy, the game will adjust itself to send different enemies until you have difficulty dealing with them.


* Make sure you know what you will be encountering in each area.


* If you hold down the fire and bomb buttons, you will constantly be doing both at a slower rate. This is great when you are in the thick of things with both air and ground targets swarming the area.


* Speaking of bombs, your Solvalou is equipped with smart bombs (so to speak). They are launch and forget weapons. When you 'paint' the target with your bomb-sight and launch your bomb, it will hit that target even when you have already flown over it. There are a couple of strategies to make your bombing runs more effective :

1) When you have targets close together (usually gun batteries are arranged this way), put a bomb between them. You will have a very good chance of taking out both batteries with one hit since you can only have one bomb on the screen at a time.

2) For moving targets (such as tanks), anticipate the targets direction and 'lead' it a little. This basically means putting the bomb at the point where the target will run into it.

3) Your bomb-sight will turn red whenever any target is 'sighted', even if the target is hidden like Sol Citadels and flags.


* Keep away from the corners. These can become death traps real quickly if you are swamped by enemies.


* Since you have free reign of most of the screen to move around, make sure you use all that room for maneuvering. Enemy fighters have a nasty habit of either shooting from behind your fighter or re-entering the screen from random sides. It also is handy when you are dodging a heavy volume of enemy fire.


* Make sure when you are maneuvering around the rolling plates, you always leave yourself a clear 'out'.  What I mean by this is there another direction to escape instead of having to move along with the plates. An occasional enemy likes to put up shots at your fighter since it is very difficult to maneuver around the rolling plates.


* The Andor Genesis Motherships are pretty easy to destroy if you work quickly. Most of the time, Zakatos and Brag Zakatos precede the arrival of the Andor Genesis Mothership. Blast these out of the sky and avoid the shrapnel. When the Andor Genesis Mothership appears, lead the target a little and quickly move up and plant your bomb at the point the center of the ship will be. The less time you waste taking on this ship, the better.


* Secret Message : The designer of Xevious has included a trick for generating his name right at the beginning of the game. As soon as Solvalou appears, move to the far right edge of the screen and begin bombing constantly. Continue bombing until the first set of attacking rings is very close to you and then shoot the rings. The message 'Namco ORIGINAL Program by EVEZOO' will appear on the screen.


* THE FLAGS : There are four flags hidden throughout the game. These flags occur in areas 1, 3, 5, and 6. All flags are along a horizontal line across the terrain. The only way to uncover a flag is to bomb it so you will have to lay a string of bombs along the entire horizontal line. This basically means moving up quickly, dealing with enemies quickly, and dropping your bombs quickly. Once a flag is uncovered, you must fly over it to get the benefits from it.


FLAG 1 : The first flag is located in the first river you encounter after you start the game. Look for the three Grobdas in a row. Just above them is a river that cuts horizontally across the terrain. Just bomb the river from left to right and around the bank closest to you. The flag should appear.


FLAG 2 : After you get past the plates, look up and to the right. There is a little lake with a small river feeding into the ocean. Start in the middle of the lake and bomb toward the little river. The flag should appear around where the river dumps into the ocean.


FLAG 3 : When you cross the first ocean, you will eventually see a dock/harbor at the top. The flag is located around the horizontal line that the longest pier projecting out is part of. You will need to quickly bomb that entire length to find and get the flag before the bottom scrolls your Solvalou too far up.


FLAG 4 : You will see a big bird picture on the desert. At the lowest point of its tail-feathers (in the lower right corner), start to bomb horizontally from right to left. The flag will appear.


* Sol Citadels : These structures require you to bomb them once to cause them to surface. They look like large storage tanks or grain silos. You then need to bomb them again to destroy them. You have a potential to collect several hundred thousand points by taking out these structures. They come in groups of 1, 4, or 8. Unlike flags, these structures are always in the same place. There are six sets of Sol Citadels.


FIRST SET : One in area 2. When you see the three Grobdas in a row on the road, start laying bombs in the area around the cul-de-sac below the last tank in a right and diagonal-down point. The citadel will be even with the cul-de-sac.


SECOND SET : One in area 3. When you see the Garu Bara, go to the left of the Garu Bara and start bombing. This is also the area that the second flag can be found.


THIRD SET : Four in area 9. There is a clear area right before you tangle with the second Andor Genesis Mothership. Where the road splits around the woods, start to lay bombs a little below the bottom edge of the road that goes to the right. You should uncover four Sol Citadels.


FOURTH SET : Eight in area 13. At the point the desert ends, there is a little grass, then the air field starts. Use the birds leg as a reference and fly straight up. When the bomb-sight glows, start bombing. This will be the lower left Sol Citadel of the group which is arranged in two rows of four citadels. You will be hard pressed to get all eight citadels.


FIFTH SET : Four in area 14. After the plates roll by, look for where two roads merge into one road. At the top edge of the slanted right hand road, start dropping bombs to uncover some more citadels.


SIXTH SET : Four in area 15. Look for a forest on the left side. There will be a small clearing and then a river. Bomb the small clearing to bring the citadels up. There will be very intense ground fire in this location so be especially watchful.

Xybots (c) 1987 Atari Games.


Xybots is a 3-Dimensional, 3rd-person perspective shoot-em-up for 1 or 2 players. Taking on the role of either 'Major Rock Hardy' or 'Captain Ace Gunn' (in the 2-player game), players must shoot their way through a huge, multi-level underground city - made up of a series of mazes - and destroy the evil 'Xybot' robot warriors that have invaded the planet and established their underground fortress. The players' on-screen counterparts walk 'into' the screen and players must manually rotate the maze's viewpoint left and right when changing direction in order to be able to look in the direction they are moving. 


Each level has at least one exit that must be reached in order to progress to the next (some levels have extra hidden exits that 'warp' players to later levels). Players can find energy pods to restore energy levels, keys to open doors, and golden coins. Some of the levels also feature transporters that connect different parts of the same level.


At the end of each level, players can enter a shop where supplies and power-ups can be purchased with any coins they have collected. Some supplies, such as 'Shield' or 'Speed' are permanent, whereas others are only temporary and must be replenished.


A map of each level is displayed at the top of the screen. For some levels, all enemies, objects and walls are shown. On later levels, however, the map may only display the enemy robots and/or objects; with the maze walls and layout only becoming visible once a player has 'looked' at a wall section. Xybots' gameplay feels highly reminiscent of a 3-Dimensional "Gauntlet" (with good reason, see TRIVIA for more details). The game also uses a split-screen display to allow for two-player simultaneous play; something of an innovation for 1987.


Like the "Gauntlet" games on which Xybots is based; the game is endless and play will continue until all lives are lost and players no longer wish to use the 'Continue' option.

- TRIVIA -


Released in November 1987.


Xybots was another in a long line of videogame innovations from Atari. The company had, of course, created the first commercially successful videogame with the legendary "Pong". They went on to develop vector graphics with 1979's "Lunar Lander"; while 1980's "Battle Zone" was on the cutting edge of technology with its hitherto unknown three-dimensional vector rendering.


Xybots was the first arcade game to put the player into a three-dimensional, third-person perspective world (with the action viewed from over the on-screen characters' shoulders). Xybots can rightly be considered to be the father of the modern day first person three-dimensional shoot-em-ups.


By 1987, Atari had split into two different companies; with each sharing the Atari name. The first company produced products for the home entertainment arena; such as personal computers, game consoles, and handhelds. The arcade company, owned by Midway, produced arcade machines exclusively. Perhaps because Xybots was so ahead of its time, it wasn't the commercial success that Atari and Midway were hoping for. Its legacy and influence on future shoot-em-ups, however, is without question.


Xybots was originally going to be "Gauntlet III", before Atari changed its mind and created a new Sci-fi setting.


The monsters and shots were rendered with 'motion objects', a method which had been around since 1977.


Joel Hedge holds the official official record for this game, on tournament setting, with 185, 300 points on 06/02/2001.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


You start you game with your man (or men in the two-player game) standing at the end of a corridor. Your goal is to make it to the exit while inflicting the most amount of damage without taking too much damage. There is also a quick tutorial during this first level to help you better gain experience for the coming levels.


General Strategies :

* Always look at the level map when you enter a level. There will be a couple of second delay before you enter the level. Look for where the exit is. This also helps to determine whether you are being put in the middle of a group of Xybots.


* Your character can lose energy in a variety of ways :

1) Naturally within the maze itself. You lose 2-3% of your energy in the maze per second. If you purchase the Extra Vitality, your energy will be lost at a slower rate. This rate is usually about 1% per second.

2) Saucers that go Kamikaze will take out 25% of your energy when they hit.

3) All other Xybots take out 10% energy per hit, but they usually fire multiple times.

4) Using the Zapper.


* Saucers like to pick up items and carry them to other parts of the level. This can be especially frustrating if you know where an item is, then return to find it gone because a saucer picked it up. Keep this in mind unless you have taken out all the saucers.


* Money is a very precious commodity in this game. This is what you use to buy the permanent and temporary items in the Supply Store. After level 7, you will be buying everything you need to get through the level. At the bare minimum, you should constantly purchase the following :

1) Wall Mapper x 3 - To give you an idea of how the maze is set up and also where the closest exit is.

2) Monster Mapper x 3 - To give you a general idea of what non-Guardian Xybots are running around.

3) Vitality x 4 - To minimize the amount of energy you lose on the level.

4) These purchases will last you a minimum of three levels before you have to purchase more temporary items.


* Keys are another valuable commodity within the mazes. Keys can open doors that can shorten one's trip to the exit, or they can open doors that have a lot of extra items in them.


* In addition to the above, attempt to get permanent items when you can. The best ones would be extra armor and shot power.


* Use the Warp Exits when you can. With the 75,000 points, you get 3 coins added to the bonus coins for using the warp. In addition, your energy is brought back to 100% again so you don't have to waste money healing up. The warp exits are located on levels 1 and 4.


* Energy orbs can give either a 50% or 100% boost to your energy. If you are only down a little, do not use it. Wait until you are under 50% energy before getting one.


* If you are placed in a wide open area, immediately look for the exit or find a protected corner. This prevents the Xybots from surrounding your character.


* Xybots follow a specific pattern when they move around. Once they spot your character, though, they will immediately go in for the attack. Sometimes multiple Xybots will swarm the area to try to eliminate your character quickly.


* When approaching corridors that turn, doorways, or openings in the wall, turn your character toward that area and sidestep to the turn or opening. That way, if there are any Xybots lurking around, you can get the first shot in and take them out before they know what happened to them.


* Your character's range of vision is four squares around. It is the same for the Xybots. When going down corridors, it's a good idea to put a few shots ''down-range''. The reason is you may catch one of the Xybots ''napping'' and eliminate them before they can react.


* When approaching openings or doorways, stop short of said opening. If a Xybot is patrolling, they won't see your character but you will see their movement pattern and then you can plan accordingly.


* Many of the levels have blue barrels. These can be used for cover when you are busy having shootouts with the Xybots. Just ''peek'' around them to get your shots off.


* Speaking of blue barrels, you can use the Zapper on them to collect items. These items are random.


* Don't use the Zapper unless it is absolutely necessary. Its purpose is to stun the enemies for a couple of seconds. This makes them vulnerable to your attacks. The energy loss to do this, though, is an uneven exchange. You will do better just shooting it out with the Xybots. Of course, if you are surrounded, then that would be a good time to use it.


* When fighting the Flys, keep in mind that they move up-and-down in addition to side-to-side making them very hard targets to hit. It addition, you will need to keep moving around to avoid their fire and the blue barrels provide minimal protection since they can fire above them.


* The teleporters in the maze act in a duel fashion. When you step on one teleporter pad, you will arrive at another one. Get off and step back on the teleporter pad you just arrived on to teleport to another place. Levels with multiple teleporter pads can be very confusing unless you do this.


* Make sure you pick your battles. If you are on a level loaded with Xybots, it may be better to find the exit then to shoot it out with them. Granted, you can get the points, items in the maze, and possible coin bonuses for score. This, though, may be an unfair exchange since you will be taking a large energy drain with little return.


* Watch your energy meter. It will go yellow when you are at 50% and go red when you are at 20% or less.


* Make sure you note the Xybots colors when you are fighting them. This is the key to tell you how many hits it will take to take them down. Don't be surprised if you hit a Xybot once and it is still firing on you.


* Some levels have false walls. These walls can be taken out with your laser fire. They do not show up differently on the main level map. Before you go shooting at the walls, make sure of what is behind those walls. Opening one of these walls could be like kicking a hornet's nest. You find yourself surrounded by Xybots intent on erasing you from existence.


* Some of the levels have a ''wrap-around'' feature. This basically means if you exit the maze on the right side, you will reappear on the left side. It gives the illusion of one continuous maze. On these types of mazes, when you look at the map, make sure you note enemies not only on your side, but on the opposite side as well.


* The big thing is to learn how to turn and move at the same time. This is in addition to being able to fire while performing this maneuver. If you can accomplish this smoothly, your chances of survival are greatly increased.


* On the first level, don't collect any money for totally massive bonus points at the end. And lots of cash.


* You can shoot around a wall to your right by putting your gun around the corner. You can shoot them but they cannot shoot you.


Two-Player Strategies : These strategies are in addition to the general strategies.


* First of all, each player is immune to the other player's shots.


* If all the Xybots are destroyed, the first player that exits the maze gets the bonus.


* The first player that exits the level gets a 5,000 point bonus.


* If one of the players enters the warp, both players will warp regardless of the other player's location.


* If one of the players dies, and the other makes it through that particular level, the other player is brought back with 50% energy. The other player also loses all the items they may have collected on that level. If both players die, the game is over.


* Learn to work with each other. The combined firepower of two people is quite significant if applied the right way.


* Watch each others back. When one person is facing one way, have the other face the other way in case some Xybots want to sneak up on you.


* In addition, watch in directions that you are unprotected. For example, in a corner one person can look straight while the other looks to one of the sides.


* Don't get greedy and have one player take everything. Learn to share items found. Also, share coins at the Supply Area so that both characters can get maximum benefits. This is a game of cooperation so treat it as such.


Boss Strategies : In order to eliminate the Master Xybot, you must take out all six of his lasers.


* You will be placed on a platform to the left of the Master Xybot. In front of you will be his hand with six openings in it.


* These openings flash at random. When they flash, they fire shots at your character. Your goal is to hit one of these openings when it is flashing. When you do, that opening is cannot fire shots anymore.


* You must run back and forth on the platform to not only avoid the laser fire, but to also shoot up the openings.


* You must take out all six openings in order to defeat the Master Xybot.


* On the later levels, the rate of fire from these openings gets faster.

Yie Ar Kung-Fu (c) 1985 Konami.


A classic one-on-one fighting game; "Yie Ar Kung-fu" pits a single player against a procession of distinctive, and often armed opponents. While somewhat limited in gameplay terms, "Yie Ar Kung-Fu" introduced a major innovation to the beat-em-up genre as it was the first one-on-one fighter to offer a progression of truly different opponents for the player to defeat. This is something that would later be adopted by Capcom for its legendary "Street Fighter" series; as well as SNK and countless others. Many of Yie Ar's eleven opponents are armed with a wide variety of weapons, such as a nunchuks, throwing stars, a chain, a sword and a club.


Yie Ar Kung-Fu is a game of reflexes and as such plays incredibly quickly, with the player having to be constantly on the move to avoid getting 'pegged in' by some of the game's tougher opponents. The first five fights take place in front of an animated waterfall, while the remaining six have the player battling in front of a picturesque, oriental pagoda. There is no time limit set in which the opponent must be defeated and the player's character, Oolong, possesses a finite amount of health per stage. Should the player's health bar be fully depleted, the match is lost.

- SCORING -


Scoring in this game is fairly complex and is dictated by what kind of punch or kick you inflict on your opponent. The more complicated the move, the more points awarded :


Flying High Punch : 500 points 

Jumping High Punch : 2000 points 

Mid-Level Punch : 500 points 

Low Punch : 700 points 

Crouching Mid-Level Punch : 900 points 

Flying High Kick : 600 points 

Jumping High Kick : 2000 points 

Mid-Level Kick : 500 points 

Low Kick : 700 points 

Lying Down High Kick : 900 points 


At the end of each stage, you will receive bonus points by adding your remaining energy x 10 to your score. If you didn't lose any energy on any of the stages one through eight, you get an additional 'Perfect' bonus of that stage number x 10000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


When you start the game, there will be a screen that lists the opponents for that block of fighting. The animated opponent is the one Oolong will be currently fighting. You will notice that some opponents have a '???' in a box under their name. This means in order to see this opponent, you must have defeated everyone else up to them. When you exit this screen, Oolong will start on the left and Oolong's opponent will start on the right side of the screen. Once you get through all 11 stages, the cycle begins anew.


* Since there is no time limit on the matches, patience is a must. Latter opponents will take advantage of every mistake made and will 'pin' the player to inflict repeated blows on Oolong.


* Every opponent has some kind of weakness to exploit. Once you learn these weaknesses, they will be much easier to defeat.


* Take advantage of Oolong's mobility. In other words; don't just stand in one place, and never allow Oolong to get trapped on the sides of the screen as this can spell instant defeat in many cases.


* Speaking of mobility, jump around the screen if you don't have a clear opening to strike your opponent. Learn to time and aim your jumps to where you believe your opponent's position will be at. Get in a quick strike and jump away before a counterstrike hits Oolong.


* Your goal on all of the fights is to avoid getting hit. In addition to prevention of energy loss, you can earn bonus points which will eventually add up to an extra life.


* When you get a hit on an opponent, you will see a red marker. If your opponents get a hit, the marker will be either black or yellow.


* Keep in mind that all your opponents know kung-fu. Just because they are wielding a weapon doesn't mean they won't take a punch or kick at Oolong if the opportunity presents itself.


* Below are listed the strategies for defeating your 11 opponents :


STAGE 1: BUCHU: This is a good introductory fight. Buchu isn't too tough of an opponent and you should be able to take him down without breaking too much of a sweat.


1) Buchu will start the round by flying over to Oolong. When he lands, give him a couple of low sweeping kicks.


2) After taking a couple of hits, Buchu will fly off again in the opposite direction. Just have Oolong jump next to him to deliver either punches or kicks. Buchu will take off again.


3) Follow the above and you should have Buchu crying "Uncle" in no time.


4) Big thing to watch out for is if you stay around him too long, he will deliver a flurry of kicks that will pin Oolong down and eventually take him out. 


STAGE 2: STAR: Your first fight with a weapon wielding opponent. Star likes to throw shurikens either high, mid-level, or low. They are pretty easy to avoid but do make it a challenge trying to close in on Star.


1) Right after Star throws a shuriken, jump toward him. If you did it right, you should be right next to him to deliver a punch or kick.


2) Quickly jump away and prepare for the next shuriken to be thrown. Again, as above, jump over to Star to deliver some more punishment.


3) Star may jump out of the way but this happens rarely.


4) If you happen to land short, just jump back out of the way since Star will take the advantage and deliver a few kicks Oolong's way.


STAGE 4 : NUNCHA : Now it starts to get interesting. The first opponent that can deliver two to three quick blows when opportunity presents itself. Nuncha is quite effective with his nun-chucks and does some serious damage if you're not ready.


1) Watch for when Nuncha starts to spin his nun-chucks. This means he is preparing to take a shot. Back up and let him advance and then jump over him.


2) He will then take his shot. Be careful in watching where he aims at because he can go high, mid-level, or low. Once he takes his shot, quickly jump over to him to get in a punch or kick. Be aware, he may block a couple of your moves with his nun-chucks.


3) Jump away quickly since he will again start spinning his nun-chucks. If you stay to long next to him, he will deliver two or three shots to pin down Oolong before Oolong can escape.


4) Continue moving around and soon Nuncha will be history.


STAGE 4: POLE: Pole is another one of those opponents who can put a major hurting on your character real quick if you're not careful. He also tends to move around a lot making it more difficult to hit him.


1) He will start off by spinning the pole above his head. If Oolong gets too close, Pole will take a couple of shots at him. The best offensive is to jump to a position you believe Pole will be at since he moves around a lot.


2) You won't have time to dally once you are next to Pole. Get in a low shot and jump out of there quickly or Oolong will meet the business end of the pole real quickly. Pole will then again spin the pole above his head and advance on Oolong. Jump over and try to hit Pole from the backside.


3) Continue to jump over Pole and get in low shots. You should have him begging for mercy in no time.


STAGE 5: FEEDLE: This is actually a series of the same opponent instead of one. This is kind of your breather before entering the second part of the tournament.


1) Feedle(s) will enter from both the left and right side of the screen. Your character will be in the middle. They only do basic moves of mid-level kicks and punches.


2) They will continue to enter from either side of the screen so you may need to move back and forth to be able to turn around rapidly to deal with the threat from both sides. Low kicks will suffice to eliminate Feedle.


3) You have to eliminate eight Feedle(s) in order to win the match. Feedle(s) will keep feeding onto the screen until you achieve that objective.


4) Do not jump on this stage or you may get yourself into trouble since there isn't much space in the line of Feedle(s) coming after your character.


STAGE 6: CHAIN: Chain is a difficult opponent unless you can move around quickly.


1) Chain starts this off by slinging his chain at Oolong. It has a limited range and it can be aimed high, mid-level, or low. The bad part about this is that even when the chain is going back to Chain, Oolong can still take a hit.


2) Once Chain fires his chain, you need to make sure that you aim Oolong to jump over Chain and get real close. If you don't, Chain turns very quickly and will launch another attack if you aren't close enough to attack him. Only do low hits to minimize your chances of getting hit by his chain. Once you get in a hit, jump back to get out of range of his chain.


3) You will also have to watch out for his low kicks if you are too far away and he doesn't use his chain.


4) Continue to jump around and get in hits and eventually you will delink him.


STAGE 7: CLUB: Club likes to act aggressive and so will advance on Oolong immediately. This is his downfall.


1) Let Club advance on Oolong. When he gets close to his striking distance, jump over him to land next to him on the other side. Deliver a couple of low kicks or punches. You may have to jump up to avoid his club.


2) Jump to the other side of the screen and let him advance on Oolong again. This time, after you jump, watch his movements. He may back up onto the side. If this happens, just jump back away and let him advance again. To really mess with him, do a small jump away from him then immediately jump to his other side.


3) Do the above a few times and club will be no more.


STAGE 8: FAN: As the opponents name implies, Fan likes to throw razor-sharp fans at Oolong.


1) She will start this stage by launching three fans at Oolong. They start high and have an uncanny ability to track Oolong (to a degree). This is also one of the few weapons that Oolong can actually counter with punches or kicks (it is hard though to get lined up).


2) Once she launches her fans, wait until the last fan gets low enough to jump over. Then jump next to her to deliver some punches and kicks. You should be able to get in two hits before you have to bounce out again. Watch out if you aren't close enough since she likes to deliver a few kicks of her own.


3) Continue to maneuver around her. You may not get in a shot after every jump but she does leave openings that can be easily exploited.


4) You will eventually send her crashing down like her fans.


STAGE 9: SWORD: This actually is one of the easier opponents to deal with. All he does is slide along the ground waiting to put a sword through Oolong.


1) Sword actually is one of the quicker opponents. He has a tendency to hit and run. Basically, if he hits Oolong, he quickly goes the opposite direction. Much quicker then Oolong can jump after him. This means you have to keep him on the defensive.


2) Get into position and jump so you are next to Sword. Do a quick low punch or kick. Sword will rapidly retreat, then advance. When he is within striking distance, hit or punch again. Sword will again retreat. This cycle should continue until Sword is skewered.


3) You may have to jump out of Sword's range if you mess up the cycle. Just repeat the above steps to get back into a rhythm again.


STAGE 10: TONFUN: Your next two opponents will test your skills to the utmost.


1) Tonfun has it all: Speed, quick attack, and aggressiveness. This means you will be moving around a whole lot to avoid his hits.


2) First of all, avoid the sides of the screen. Tonfun likes to crowd the sides and pin Oolong down. This means you will be doing a lot of jumping around. In addition, he has the nasty habit of blocking a lot of your attacks.


3) Hit and run is the name of the game here. This means you will have to jump over him, spin around, get in a low attack, and jump back before he counter-attacks very quickly. If you hesitate on any of these, Tonfun will have fun giving Oolong a couple of shots which knock down the energy bar significantly.


4) You may have to do a lot of jumps before you can even get in a hit on Tonfun. Expect this to be a long fight.


STAGE 11: BLUES: Blues is a worthy opponent for the final match. He is very quick and can put Oolong down in just a few hits. Plus, he likes to jump around the screen. This is the ultimate test of skill.


1) Blues will immediately jump over to Oolong to deliver a few hits. This means you need to be constantly jumping around and looking for an opening. Unfortunately, Blues leaves very few openings to exploit.


2) Do not, under any circumstance, have Oolong hang out at the sides. Blues will trap Oolong and deliver enough punches and kicks to keep Oolong pinned down so you can't even jump. A quick way to end a stage with a defeat.


3) Also, don't even attempt to go "toe-to-toe" with Blues since he is much quicker then Oolong in the delivery of attacks. Use the tried-and-tested method of hit and run. This time, you have to be sure of your shot. If you miss, or if Blues blocks Oolongs attack, be prepared for a major counter-attack if you don't move out of the way in time. This means you need to basically attack and jump back at the same practical moment.


4) Blues also will jump around the screen when Oolong does. This makes it very difficult to pinpoint a position that Blues may be in. In addition, Blues can quickly move out of Oolong's attack range if Oolong isn't quick enough, or get behind Oolong to deliver a few blows of his own.


5) This battle will last a while Oolong and Blues jockey for position to deliver their hits. Unfortunately, skill and luck both are factors in this battle. Just do the above steps to tip the balance in your favor.


After defeating Blues, the game will start again at the first stage.

Yosaku to Donbei (c) 1979 Wing.


In this title you play a little farmer guy, who is attempting to shoot down the crows out of his tree. Gameplay is identical to that of "Space Invaders". A large bird replaces the UFO that goes over the top of the screen from time to time. While a lumberjack will chop out a section of the tree every time the birds reach the side of the screen (lowering them closer to the bottom). The only real gameplay difference is that the birds come in a pyramid pattern, as opposed to the rectangle pattern of "Space Invaders". This serves to make the game much easier.

Zaxxon (c) 1982 Sega.


ZAXXON is a unique isometric perspective, in which you find yourself piloting an 'attack-shuttle' spacecraft, strafing the enemy's asteroid city in an attempt to destroy fuel tanks, gun emplacements, missiles, fighters and the dreaded enemy robot. With the aid of an altimeter that constantly monitors your height, you control your ship with an aircraft-style joystick, barnstorming your way through wall openings, under electronic barriers, dodging rockets, and in a later round, dueling with the insidious enemy robot. A successful attack-run across ZAXXON leads us to a deep-space dogfight with enemy planes. As you climb, turn and dive, a 'cross-hair' appears on the screen to indicate exact positioning for a laser hit on incoming craft. Notice the buffeting as you fly near 'proximity explosions'. In addition to your altitude, a running count is displayed of your score, number of ships remaining to you, number of enemy ships remaining to be destroyed, and fuel remaining. Fuel bonuses, as well as points, are awarded for destroying fuel tanks, but your ship crashes if you run out of fuel between rounds.


After a specified number of enemy ships are destroyed, the robot appears, launching seeker-missiles. Destruction of the robot requires six direct hits on the robot's missile launcher, after which the round changes with greater difficulty. Number of player ships and bonus point levels are operator selectable. Game play ends with the loss of your last ship.


- TECHNICAL -


There were 2 different dedicated cabinets available for Zaxxon, an upright and a cocktail :

* The upright version came in a nice woodgrain cabinet with black and blue sticker style sideart. The marquee is a blue 'Zaxxon' logo with a star filled background. The control panel has a nice 8-Way flight stick with fire buttons on either side, and graphics explaining how to play the game. Finally the upright uses two sets of coin mechs that are of an odd 'skinny' style.

* The cocktail version came in the standard Sega/Gremlin cocktail table (this same table was also used for "Frogger", "Carnival", and several other titles). This was a relatively unadorned machine, the only decorations were a set of instruction cards underneath the glass. This machine had a control panel on either side and used Wico balltop joysticks instead of flight sticks.

All versions used a vertical open frame monitor, and ran the same set of game boards. This game is fully compatible with "Congo Bongo", "Super Zaxxon", and "Future Spy" (those boards will plug right in without modification).

- TRIVIA -


Released during January 1982. At the time of its release, Zaxxon was unique as it was the first game to employ isometric projection, something of a three-quarters viewing perspective. This effect simulated three dimensions (albeit from the viewpoint of a second person).


In the game, Zaxxon is the name of the enemy robot who you must destroy. Milton Bradley turned this and other Sega titles into board games. 'Can You Complete Your Mission Before Zaxxon Zaps You?'.


Vernon Kalanikaus holds the official official record for this game with 4,680,740 points on 03/15/1982.


A Zaxxon unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames'.


A bootleg of this game is known as "Jackson".


- UPDATES -


Zaxxon was released in at least 2 versions :

The latest version (set 1 in MAME (zaxxon)) corrects a minor error in the way the original zaxxon rom set (set 2 in MAME (zaxxon2)) managed fractions of a credit, seen only when a player earned credit through game play when the game dipswitch settings provided only a fraction of a full credit for each token inserted.

Gun Implacements (Green and Gray) : 200 or 500 points (random)

Fuel Tank : 300 points

Radar Tower : 1000 points

Missile (Ground-to-Air) : 150 points

Missile (Air-to-Air) : 200 points

Fighters (in air) : 100 points + (50 points/level after level 2)

Zaxxon (destroyed with missile in launcher) : 1000 points

Zaxxon (destroying launched missile) : 200 points

Destroying all planes in space : 1000 points

Satellite : 300 points


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* To kill the robot at the end of every second level, fly at 2 1/2 units (in other words, with two blocks of your altimeter filled in and one at halfway). Shoot 6 shots at the robot's missile, and you will kill it quickly. If you miss, either dodge the missile, or keep firing and you can still blow up the missile. However, you get less points for hitting the missile while it's in the air.


* Flying at an altitude of 1 1/2 will allow you to hit ground targets while making their shots go harmlessly under you.


* Shoot airplanes on the ground : it will reduce the number you need to kill in the space scene. If you shoot all the airplanes in space you will get a bonus.


* On the levels in outer space, start up the highest point on the upper left and start shooting immediately. You should be able to hit the satellite right away. If you miss, keep moving to the left and keep firing. This works for the second satellite also.


* This is important in later levels because it is possible to run out of fuel in space : if you hit the satellite, you will get some back.


* There are only two levels that repeat. The first air fortress level never gets much harder : use the same pattern for it. On the other levels, only the gaps become narrower.


* Always keep firing! This way you can see if you will make it through the gaps, and you can adjust your height as needed.


* The white canopy only indicates that the enemy plane is at the highest altitude. At any altitude, when an enemy is in your line of fire you will hear a tone and a white X appears in front of your plane. This makes it much easier to grab the 1,000 point bonus for destroying 20 enemy planes, as well as to avoid their shots.


* On later levels you will lose fuel quickly. Make sure you hit as many fuel tanks as possible. If you run out of fuel you will lose a ship.

* Others :

VFD handheld game (1981) released by Coleco : one of the coolest handheld arcade conversion, Coleco's Zaxxon uses a unique combination of mirrors and 2 different VFD displays to get a 3-D affect. Your ship appears to be flying above the surface of the planet and actually flies over walls and other VFD generated images (not possible with just one VFD display). The planet's surface and ground based enemies are created by one VFD, while you and air-based enemies are created by the VFD reflected off a mirror.

 

LCD handheld game (1982) released by Bandai : it's a cool double panel LCD game (there are two LCD panels on top of each other). The dual panel creates a kind of 3D effect with lower objects on one panel, and higher ones on the other. Also, all of the background images are created by the LCD and animated. It's quite impressive for an LCD game (and a must have if you love Zaxxon!).

 

VFD handheld game (19??) released by Bandai : this game has a unique way of creating a 3-D effect - it only uses 1 VFD display (unlike Coleco's Zaxxon which uses two). The VFD is basically split in two, the upper half you see as the lower part of the playing field, while the lower part of the VFD is reflected on a semi-transparent mirror to create the upper half of the 3-D playing space.. Pretty cool idea to help, and it really works in that all of the ships (not just the players ship like on the Coleco version) have a true depth. It's a little awkward to play sometimes as you have to sit just right to get all of the screen centered perfectly, but once you are in position, it's a very nice version of Zaxxon. It features the planes in space mode, and the flying over land mode.. The only thing that seems to be missing is the actual Zaxxon boss at the end...

Zektor (c) 08/1982 Sega.


Zektor is a one or two player game that tasks you with the liberation of eight cities that have been seized by the evil cadre of alien robots. In order to liberate a city, you must defeat 3 attack waves of fighters and robo-probes. Fighters and Robo-probes are often shielded (in red), and each consecutive hit reduces the enemies shield strength, until, when the shield drops, a hit will destroy it. In addition, you will encounter three types of Moboids :

* Green Moboids spin the players ship on contact, and bounce enemy ships.

* Blue Moboids bounce all ships.

* Red Moboids destroy all un-shielded ships (including the players ship).


After defeating three attack waves, the Alien Robot holding that city will reappear within rotating protective rings, through which a 'slot shot' neutralizes that Robot, awarding the player a bonus ship and advancement to the next round.

Zoo Keeper (c) 1982 Taito.


A superb, fast-paced arcade game in which the player takes control of Zeke the zoo-keeper. Many of the animals at Zeke's zoo are running wild and have captured Zeke's girlfriend, Zelda. Zeke must recapture as many animals as possible and rescue his sweetheart from the animals' clutches.


Zoo Keeper features 2 different, alternating play fields, with each level having its own task to complete; as well as a final 'bonus screen'. The three levels are as follows :


On the first play field, players must move Zeke around the outside of an animal enclosure, constantly re-building the enclosure wall that the animals are set on destroying. Any wild animals that are lose must be jumped over or the player will lose a life. The level's timer is represented as a fizzing fuse, and along this fuse are a number of bonus items such as beer or a net for catching escaped animals. When the timer's fuse reaches an item, it will appear on screen and can be picked up. Once the timer makes it to the word 'End', the current level is completed and play moves on to the next level. The bonus items that occasionally appear include mugs of beer, ice cream sundaes, clover clubs, watermelons, etc.


If Zeke manages to pick up a net, he will be able to capture the animals and put them back into the Zoo. The net will eventually disappear and the captured animals will try to escape once more by breaking through the enclosure wall. Zeke will have to continue building the wall around the Zoo until the time is up. At the end of the level, bonus points are awarded for every animal inside the wall. Animals found on this level are snakes, moose, camels, rhinos, elephants and a lion.


On the second, more difficult play field, Zelda is tied to a palm tree and Zeke must rescue her by jumping to the top of the screen via a series of moving platforms; dodging the coconuts thrown by a mischievous monkey. On each of the platforms, various foods and drinks can collected to earn extra points. Sometimes, one of the ledges will have a 'Free Game' sign that will grant the player a free credit. While Zelda is tied up, she says 'save me', and whenever Zeke gets knocked out by one of the deadly coconuts, she says 'Oh, no!' If Zeke makes it all the way to the top and rescues her, she says 'My Hero' and a bonus of 5000 points is awarded.


The first and second screens are alternated before the player finally reaches the third and final 'bonus screen'. Here, Zeke must jump over the herds of charging animals that are running from a cage at the foot of an escalator. Zeke must reach the escalator behind the animals' cage and make his way up to the next floor, where a second escalator - replete with more charging animals - awaits. Zeke must reach the top of the second escalator to rescue the trapped Zelda.


After Zeke has rescued Zelda on the final screen, the game begins again with an increased level of difficulty.

- TRIVIA -


Originally called "King Crab", Zoo Keeper was one of the few American-designed games that Taito released (with "Space Dungeon" and "Qix" being two others).


Here's a story straight from John Morgan, one of the programmers : "In 1982, Keith Egging was the Director of Creativity (or some weird title like that). He always had a human skull on his desk which opened up on a hinge and was filled with Hershey's kisses. One day a TV news crew came over to do some interview, and Keith showed them around. He took them back into our area and really played it up (feed them some pretty thick bull which they really ate it up). He took them to the farthest office of cubicles and said that this was DEEP THOUGHT - where all the heaviest thinking took place. Of course this was just made up (the office being picked for it's distance only), but hey, they bought it. The main programmers (me, Mark Blazczyk and Rex Battenberg) took off on this and other of Keith's tall tales and frequently made up whoppers about everything under the sun to one up each other with our far fetched stories. Pretty cool for those days.


Anyway, Keith came up with a weird game idea which I was going to program (back in those days there was only one programmer for pretty much all aspects of the entire game). His idea was to have a game where a crab would run around a rectangle on the screen. There were little eggs with faces on them that came out of the inside of the screen and would bounce off the rectangle and take bites out of it. When they went all the way through to the outside of the rectangle they would become tadpoles running around the rectangle edge. If the tadpole touched the crab it would be killed.


The crab would move around the screen and jump over the tadpoles, with it's claws opening and closing. To repair the wall damage where the eggs bit off chunks of the wall, you pressed a button and a thick line would shoot across the screen from underneath the crab and away from it (horizontally or vertically as appropriate). We were going to use the sound of castinets when this line was fired out - he really loved that sound.


This is about the stage where Keith's input finished, and the rest of the changes were almost entirely from my ideas.


Now, as a sidenote, we had no way to get art into the games. So I wrote some software that would allow you to use a modified control panel (with more buttons) so that you could create art (pixel by pixel) on the screen itself, complete with animation control. We hired a part time animator to use it to design the animals, complete with great motion for the time.


Secondly, we had to have sound effect and music. Tom Fosha (another programmer and a bit of a sick puppy in his own right) had been playing around with code to do some sound effects. Note that every sound sample was computer controlled (just like the graphics were). I looked at them and saw that they all either played with the volume of the samples (thus affecting the amplitude), or the duration inbetween the samples as they were output (thus affecting the frequency). I decided to write a single unified piece of code from scratch where you had two 24 byte buffers. One buffer held the volume levels for the looped sample (fairly traditional), and the second held the duration from each sample to the next (cutting a bit of new ground here). I then allowed each of these two waveforms to be independantly controlled. You could smoothly morph a waveform from one to another (again pretty new for that time) or you could slowly add waveforms. You could avoid clipping of the signal (where a value is too positive and becomes negative etc) or you could force it to occur (this had some really weird sounding effects). Since 24 samples is a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12, you could have samples which had different frequencies in the samples themselves. They made me a switchbox with 8 switches, so that I could try out code and use the swithes to select amoung 16 voltage waveforms, and 16 frequency waveforms which combined with the particular controlling code I was trying. With trial and error, I came up with a zillion really weird sounds that I had never imagined. The ones I liked I kept, and that is where all of the sound effects came from in the game. They were all experimentally procedural.


For the musical tunes, Tom Fosha wrote a seperate multi-tone player, and composed the tunes himself which were used for all the melodies in the game. He was really into jazz, and that came over beautifully in the game. OK, back to the game. I wanted to somehow allow you to shoot out more walls to hold in the eggs. So I put little locks on the screen randomly. When you shot a line which hit a lock, it would shoot two lines out perpendicular to your line. If any of these lines hit another lock, you would get a cascade effect. When enough locks appeared it could be pretty cool visually. But the problem was that so many walls evenly distributed could trap the eggs near the outside of the rectangle (instead of the middle) and they'd just bounce & eat their way out to the outside anyway.


So then I made the distribution of the locks more towards the four corners. This tended to make solid walls around the outer edge, which helped, but you could still trap the eggs near the outside and they'd still escape. That's about the time when I said that seeing a big crab get killed by eggs which turned to little tadpoles was a bit goofy. I suggested that we change the crab to a person who ran around the rectangle and where he ran he would lay bricks which would fill from the outside in. The brick laying would stop if there was an enemy there so that there would be a clear space for it to return to the center.


I suggested we change the eggs to animals which kept their form when they escaped, and would similarly kill the guy if he didn't jump over them. Since the guy was trying to keep the animals in then it seemed to make sense that he was a Zoo Keeper (I believe this was in a meeting with Ray Heidel, the Engineering Director). So we put a small cage in the center from which the animals escaped. I thought it would be cool to allow the Zoo Keeper to have a net which he used on the escaped animals which would put them back in the cage. And so I made the time line fuse which burned down, and along it were nets which would briefly give the Zoo Keeper this power. The actual art made the net look more like a frying pan (by accident), but that seemed pretty cool so I kept it and gave it an appropriate sound and effect when hitting the animals. I thought it'd be great to flash the entire screen for 1 frame when you did this. It had a pretty amazing subliminal effect on the excitement level.


In the original version, when the animals escaped the rectangle they would randomly decide whether to run clockwise or counter clockwise. This made it hard to survive since you couldn't predict their behavior if they escaped near you, and having roughly half of the animals running each way made it pretty hard to survive for long by jumping over them. So I decided that when the animal escaped, it would run in the direction away from you (where you were at that time). This way they wouldn't escape near you and run into you, so you'd have a lot of warning before they got you.


I made the reward for jumping over animals based on how many animals you jumped over. For each extra animal I roughly doubled the score. This continued for as many animals there were maximum in the game (16ish or so?, it's been a long time :-) So if you jumped a really massive number of animals you would get a gazillion points. But how do you get the animals to clump up for such a massive jump?


That's when I decided to remove the initial bricks around the rectangle at the start of a level. I delayed the initial animals escaping the cage, to give you time to drop down and start laying the wall as you saw fit. The trick was to run in one direction and cover just slightly over 50% of the rectangle with a wall and then just stop. This would allow the animals to immediately escape, but they'd always run away from you which forced them to all go in the same direction. And since they were in the same direction it was easier to survive, and since different animals moved at different speeds, they would tend to clump together periodically so you could wait for that to happen and then jump over a huge number of animals in a single jump - and voila - you could get huge scores! 


Now, when the net came out, you would only want to knock in the animals that were running opposite to the direction of the herd. This you'd try to stand near a hole to force the escaping animals to run in the same direction as the herd. 


This pretty much completed the game play of the initial level. It was really fun, but I wanted to have something more to break up the monotiny. So I came up with the idea of the ledge screen. You started at the bottom and could jump up on the moving ledges to get to your girl and save her. She was help captive by a gorilla throwing coconuts at you which would kill you (yeah, a bit of inspiration from Donkey Kong was going on here). I think it was Keith who came up with the name of Zeke and Zelda for the Zoo Keeper and his lady. I decided to make the ledges come out in a pre-determined sequence to reward the experienced player in that they would learn their preferred sequence of jumps to get safely to the top. This level was pretty cool, but I wondered what else I could do. 


So, I came up with the idea of the escalator screen (similar to the ledge screen but with a different game play layout). This time when Zeke got to the top Zelda would give him a kiss. 


Now you could cycle between these 3 levels for as long as a person could survive. If they made it far enough to loop back to levels they'd already done, I'd just speed things up a bit each time. Eventually they wouldn't be able to survive. For added coolness, I made the last escalator level so that when you saved Zelda a curtain would draw down over both of you, and a whole bunch of kisses would be all that appear. I wanted to make the kisses go up and down but we thought that would be a bit too much :-) 


Anyway, I got to be pretty good at the game and could survive longer and longer. I decided to add a visually frantic feel to the game at these levels by cycling the color of the outer background. This massive color cycling effect would slightly distort the screen image due to power blooming of the monitor. This really cranked up the adrenaline. I'd survive so long that I'd have the maximum number of animals out in almost the same direction and jumping almost all of them at once occasionally for some phenominal score. This whole time I did this I was wrenching the joystick like I was going to break it off and the whole machine was rocking like the back seat in a drive in. I knew something was happening here. 


Then I survived so long that I came to a ledge screen where the ledges had disappeared completely. Seems I found a bug. But the thrown coconuts were bouncing off of them even though they were invisible. So I gave jumping a try. Remember that the ledge sequence was completely predictable and I had gotten quite familiar with it. So I actually had a chance of getting to the top. That's when I decided to not fix the bug, but make it a feature (I guess the old saying "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" really did apply here). We were ready to test the game. I put in the needed diagnostics so the operator could control it. Since speed of the game was key to how long people could play, I made two operator speed adjustments. The first controlled the speed when a person initiall joined. The second controlled the speed when a person played for a long time. We put the machine out on test and I watched the players and timed them with a stopwatch. Then I tweaked these adjustments until they seemed optimal for fun and earnings.


The game went out in 1983 and was about the number three game of the year nationwide, which was quite good. Unfortunately, this was right at the time when the whole arcade market took one huge dive, so the game only sold a fraction of what it would have if completed just a year earlier. As Keith said, "The cash box is a cruel mistress! It is indeed.".


Shawn Cram holds the official official record for this game with 21,849,650 points on 06/15/2003.


- UPDATES -


Early machines had a bug in which the player could turn the machine off and on and get one or two free credits.


- SCORING -


As time progresses, you can pick up items that will give you points. Among one of the items is a white mallet. When you get the mallet the background will turn blue for about seven seconds. Any animal you come in contact with will return to the cage. In round one, for example, where you have to tend to five elephants, the first three items are mugs of root beer, worth 120, 250, and 500 points; the white mallet, the last item, scores 1,000 points. When time runs out, the stage is completed, and points are scored for every animal that is still inside the wall. The six animals, in order of ferocity :

Elephant : 250 points.

Snake : 500 points.

Camel : 1,000 points.

Rhinoceros : 2,000 points.

Moose : 4,000 points.

Lion : 30,000-60,000 points.


When not tending to the wall, you can jump over the animals to score points :

One animal : 100 points.

Two animals : 500 points.

Three animals : 2000 points.

Four animals : 6000 points.

Five animals : 15,000 points.

Six animals : 30,000 points.

Seven animals : 60,000 points.

Eight animals : 120,000 points.

Nine animals : 250,000 points.

Ten animals : 500,000 points.

Eleven animals : 1,000,000 points.


- TIPS AND TRICKS -


* Zoo Keeper contains a little-known free game feature. You can go into option and set the 'Free Game Rate' to 99 to make it appear more frequently. If it's set to 0, it won't come out at all. The Zoo Keeper Flyer actually has a note saying that the free game feature maybe prohibited in some states! - The free game icon pops up on one of the platforms on the 3rd screen (coconuts). It comes out like one of the bonuses, but instead it says 'Free Game' in a little box. When it appears, it has it's own little tune too (and it usually pops up opposite of where you are, so if you are at the bottom of the screen, it will come out at the top).


* Use A Benefit Free Try : Start the game, build the first wall of bricks a bit without jumping and immediately crash into an animal. If you have never jumped before, you won't lose a life. The game will simply advise you that you need to jump over animals to avoid them and round 1 will start again from its beginning. Best of all, you get to keep the wall of bricks that you built a bit. Of course, this being the first level, chances are you don't exactly need the extra help - but hey.


* An Obscure Trick : On the coconut boards, when you jump onto the top ledge, you get some points. Jump off the ledge then onto it again; you'll get twice as many points. And again, for four times as many. The bonus keeps doubling until 300K per land. The best board to try this on is the board where the ledges are invisible. It's kind of hard to jump on then off, but so few coconuts are thrown that you have lots of room for error.

ZZYZZYXX (c) 1982 Cinematronics.


Perseverance will be overwhelming emotion game players as they move ZZYZZYXX up and down horizontal rows of alternating moving bricks to gather presents which will satisfy his love. Lola -- whose affection is not easily captured. ZZYZZYXX's vulnerability increases (as he collects gifts, as well as points) not only because of Lola's untouchable attitude, but because of obstacles such as rattifers trying to put an end to ZZYZZYXX's quest for Lola's love and affection.


Intelligent as the rattifers may be, there are 2 defenses ZZYZZYXX can use to outsmart the destructive creatures. ZZYZZYXX can brick himself within a brick when he sees an approaching rattifer or ZZYZZYXX can move into the space where there is a gold helmet. The gold helmet intensifies ZZYZZYXX's goal to reach Lola by allowing ZZYZZYXX to use the helmet to enclose a rattifer or break through one brick which is obstructing ZZYZZYXX's course towards Lola.


As irreproachable as Lola appears. Lola is overjoyed by ZZYZZYXX's success to retrieve enough presents and she whistles resoundingly to let ZZYZZYXX know. After ZZYZZYXX's triumphant deed for love. ZZYZZYXX becomes invincible, enabling him to elude the rattifers by imprisoning them within their spaces.


Other dangers testing ZZYZZYXX's skillful maneuvering are falling bombs, rising missiles and cracked bricks, each capable of disintegrating ZZYZZYXX.


As an added attraction, when a game player completes each level, there are animated cartoons depicting ZZYZZYXX's passionate desire to impress his love for Lola. Also delightful music throughout the game leaves the players humming and their foot tapping.

Cinematronics never designed a dedicated cabinet for this game. It can be found in any of the generic black cabinets of the day (they used several different ones during the production run). No side-art was made, just a control panel overlay, marquee, and two stickers (which were applied to a generic glass monitor bezel). A far cry from the standard floor to ceiling art that decorated most games in the early eighties. This game uses a unique wiring harness that is not compatible with any other titles, although it could be rigged up in any vertical cabinet with a little work.
