$info=yard,vsyard
$mame
Known issues:

- Vs. mode runs only in cocktail mode (second player controls inverted).
  That's probably how the game is designed.



$end

$info=1942,1942a,1942b
$mame
Known issues:

- Sometimes ""1942a"" ends in an endless loop over the sea, and the end of level
  boss doesn't appear. It hasn't been verified whether ""1942"" and ""1942b"" do the
  same; ""1942"" might be a later release that fixes this bug.



$end

$info=1943,1943jap
$mame
Known issues:

- Colors in test mode are not correct, but the board the PROMs were read from
  does the same. The colors in the game seem to be correct.

- To be able to access items 4-7 in the test menu, you must keep 3 pressed
  while pressing F3.
$end

$info=4dwarrio
$mame
Known issues:

- Sound hangs after you die.



$end

$info=64street
$mame
Bugs:

- Most of the graphics are missing making the game unplayable, 64street36b6yel, MvdV



$end

$info=aerofgt
$mame
Bugs:

- aerofgtb and aerofgtc display the following error at startup: "Error: gfx[0] extends past allocated memory". Aerofgtb36b15red, Foxster



$end

$info=alexkidd
$mame
Bugs:

- In alexkidd (set 2), when you move up or down, the graphics get a little off lineÿ towards the mid-bottom of the screen. Graphics mess up seems to happen across the screen near the area Alex is standing, alexkidd36b4gre, YMI

- I know this doesn't work, but this time it just exits back to dos when you try to run the game, it never did that before. alexkidd36b9yel Falkor



$end

$info=alpine,alpinea
$mame
Known issues:

- Collision detection is not emulated properly.



$end

$info=anteater
$mame
Known issues:

- cocktail mode doesn't work. This might well be a bug in the original.



$end

$info=aof
$mame
Bugs:

- some stages slow down and have messed up graphics without 16-bit colour, aof36b1ora, Haze


$end

$info=apb
$mame
Bugs:

- Some of the cars in APB still have a transparant like shell coloring since beta 14. Apb36b15gre, Frotz



$end

$info=arkanoid,arknoidu,arkbl2,arkatayt
$mame
Known issues:

- Due to features of the 68705 not emulated yet, the ""arkbl2"" bootleg set
  doesn't work.

- There might also be protection related problems in ""arknoidu"" (later levels
  corrupted).Since it doesn't have to emulate the 68705, Continuing game after 'game over' does not deduct credit. If you have 1 credit and your game ends and you press 'fire' and '1 player' to continue, you will still have one credit, arkanoid36b6gre, Andy_S 

 -This is most likely observed in slower machines, like a Pentium 100: After boot, when timer reaches 0, MAME stops responding for 2 seconds, then come back to normal. During that time, it's not possible even exit the emulator,arkanoid36b8gre,Bugfinder 



$end

$info=arkarea
$mame
Bugs:

- hiscore not working: gamelist.txt confirms, -listinfo says "hiscore good". So, which file should we trust? Arkarea36b9gre, Bugfinder



$end

$info=armedf
$mame
Bugs:

- I get a sound glitch when losing a life in armedf for b13. There is a squeal that sounds like it should be the death sound, then two static pops. Armedf36b13gre, Triggerfin



$end

$info=armwrest
$mame
Bugs:

- Graphic glitches in first bonus round. Subsequent bonus rounds (After rounds 5 and 9) are unplayable because of missing money bag sprite. High scores (except for first place) are not saved, armwreb9yel, Sardius



$end

$info=aso
$mame
Bugs:

- Graphics on the title screen are totally messed up. When entering level 2 upon moving the graphics become corrupt until you re-centre yourself. Graphics become worse throughout the game,asokgre,Philipp



$end

$info=assault
$mame
Bugs:

- listed as having working high scores but do not, assault36b8gre,Pook



$end

$mame
Bugs:

- single credit mode does not work. Astrob136b15yel, Q.T. Quazar



$end

$info=astrof
$mame
Known issues:

- The background is blue. It was black in all the original boards checked, but
  there is no obvious bug in the emulation.



$end

$info=astyanax
$mame
Bugs:

- The score/lives - counter is in the background in some levels (e.g. level 5/6) and the stone-blocks (extras) are in the foreground (see my astyanax/lordofk.inp file on the MARP page)! Astyanax36b10gre, Alex

- some sound effect are missing (like the 'coin' sound, the 'storm' during the intro and a part of the music), astyanax36b12gre, YMI 
$end

$info=batman

$end

$info=bermudat
$mame
Bugs:

- Garbage graphic on the title screen + priority problem (the remaining hole of the destructed enemy on the ground are over your space ship),bermudat36b3gre, YMI



$end

$info=bionicc
$mame
Bugs:

- Previously mentioned background color problems verified in levels 3 and on. Background colors will either start wrong, then self-correct or will start correct, go wrong, but usually self-correct before level is over. I've included a zip file showing messed up areas, as well as the same areas when correct.bionicc36b7gre Randy



$end

$info=bladestl
$mame
Bugs:

- During the between period shootout, an error, in MAME text, or something to that nature, displays. (It doesn't affect the game.) bladestl36b13gre, Sports Dude



$end

$info=blazer
$mame
Bugs:

- Blazer crashes every so often with a CWSDPMI SIGSEGV error under real DOS. Since it doesn't happen every time I don't have any additional info. blazer36b12red Gamester 



$end

$info=block
$mame
Bugs:

- Since 36b14 controls don't work. Player 1 is using player 2's controls now. Player 2 has no controls. Block36b15yel, Frotz/Triggerfin



$end

$info=bzone,bzone2
$mame
Known issues:

- There are two control methods:

-  1) E,I,D,K,Space: Close to the original controls (two up/down sticks)

-  2) Arrow keys+CTRL: simulates a 4-way joystick

- In 0.36b13 there's an extra set of controls. However, they cannot be mapped to any key. bzone36b13gre, Frotz



$end

$info=blaster
$mame
Known Issues:

- The first time you run the game, it will say ""factory settings restored"".
Press F2 to proceed.



$end

$info=blasto
$mame
Known Issues:

- Inserting a coin restarts the game. This is correct behavior, present in the actual arcade machines.



$end

$info=blastoff
$mame
Bugs:

- At certain points in Blast Off, the speech doesn't match what's happening in the game. For example, early in the game when a spy ship appears the game says "Congratulations" and when it turns to go away the game says "Thank you" which doesn't make much sense. It seems the game should say "Spy ship sighted" and "Don't let the spy ship get away". Both phrases are in the game, I checked the voices in the sound test. I've never seen Blast Off in the arcades so I can't be certain if this is a MAME bug or not but couldn't this be a problem in emulating the protection key ? blastoff36b9gre, Gamester



$end

$info=blazer
$mame
Bugs:

- I might as well mention this, when you shoot an air missle (button 2) in the Namco System 1 game Blazer, right before it explodes a black square appears.ÿ You can easily see this by using SHIFT-P to go frame-by-frame, blazer36b8gre, btribble



$end

$info=blktiger
$mame
Bugs:

- when some enemies are hit, the vitality bar flashes slightly (seems strange to me, I don't remember ever seeing it at the arcades), blktiger35fgre, Bugfinder



$end

$info=block
$mame
Bugs:

- The shadow underneath the paddle flashes off and on, block36b6gre, Andy_S



$end

$info=bmaster
$mame
Bugs:

- Sprite list register isn't updated in service mode, Mish

- On stages 4 & 5, there are clipping problems. The boss on stage 4 is a big octopus which has 3 tentacles facing the player. When the player walks in-between them, he can still be seen even though he can't walk through. On the next stage, there are a few doorways that the player clips through as well. bmaster36b10gre, IF



$end

$info=bombjack
$mame
Bugs:

- There is a bit in the sprite attributes which I don't know what means: it seems to be set only when the (B) materializes. 

- The INITIAL HIGH SCORE setting doesn't only set that, it does something else as well - but I don't know what. Retrolover



$end

$info=bosco,bosconm
$mame
Known issues:

$mame
Bugs:

- listed as having working high scores but do not, bwidow36b8gre, Pook

$end

$info=cawing
$mame
Bugs:

- While the plane is being refueled, the top right corner of the screen turns into a black block. Cawing36b15gre, J-Pikachu

\
$end

$info=centiped,centipd2,centipdb
$mame
Bugs:

- Many people complain about erratic or uncontrollable mouse beahviour for this game. This is not a bug, Nicola Salmoria maintains that the controller is perfectly emulated. The only way to improve this is to dramatically decrease the controller sensitivity in the tab menu. Earlier versions of Mame reportedly suffer less from this - KiLLerCloWn



$end

$info=cheekyms
$mame
Info:

- When music is playing in attract mode, the game doesn't accept credits. 



$end

$info=chelnov,chelnovj
$mame
Known issues:

- One color PROM is different in the two sets, so one copy is most likely bad,
  but we don't know which one.



$end

$info=chiller
$mame
Bugs:

- In CHILLER, the introductory "hint" screen has incorrect colors. The first row of hints (and picture hidden behind it) is fine, but the other rows' colors are wrong, chiller36b11gre, btribble



$end

$info=chimerab
$mame
Bugs:

- In the last level the foreground is missing (you can see it in the chimerab.inp file on MARP), chimerab36b10gre, Alex

$mame
Known issues:

- chplft doesn't work because the 8751 is not emulated.



$end

$info=cischeat
$mame
Bugs:

- The sky is often miscolored, in sort of a brownish hue. Most of the time, this occurs when you drive up a steep road, and it occurs very frequently on the beginning of the second stage. It could be a color depth bug, but I'm not sure. cischeat136b11gre, Sports Dude

-Some of the "text art" (for example, billboards, road signs, and any other misc. text that's not in the foreground) is inverted. "One Way" signs and non TV trucks are like this, and bus advertisments might be the same way. Most of it is fine, though...so it could just be a game bug. cischeat236b11gre, Sports Dude

- When your car flips over and crashes, the speed is set to zero, like it should. However, when your car is still flipping, your car can still accelerate, and when it's turned back on the wheels, the car moves on normally, like it hadn't crashed. (Basically, you can get a "rolling start" after a crash.), cischeat336b11gre, Sports Dude
$end

$info=citycon
$mame
Known issues:

- In cocktail mode, player 2 uses the same controls as player 1. Maybe then  port is multiplexed.

Bugs:

- There are no key mappings for Player 2 available. As a result, in cocktail mode Player 2 cannot control the game, citycon36b1gre, Chad H



$end

$info=ckongs
$mame
Bugs:

- Colour problems, ckongskgre, Smeagol



$end

$info=cobracom
$mame
Bugs:

- There may be sprite/playfield priorities which aren't implemented yet, cobracomkgre, Official known problem

$end

$info=congo,tiptop
$mame
Known issues:

- What do the dip switches do?



$end

$info=ckong,ckonga,ckongjeu,ckongo,ckongalc,monkeyd,ckongs
$mame
Known issues:

- music doesn't seem to work correctly in ""ckongs"".

- cocktail mode doesn't work in ""ckongs"" - the game resets after player 1 dies.
  This is likely a bug in the game.



$end

$info=cosmogng
$mame
Bugs:

- only one problem, one of the challenge stages (around gang/level 20) has all the little creepers missing, all you see is white circles moving around. Probably some kind of masking for shades or whatever., cosmogng36b9gre, IF



$end

$info=ccastles,ccastle2
$mame
Known issues:

- Keyboard control isn't up to the task. Use the mouse.

- The self test doesn't pass the EERAM test.



$end

$info=curvebal
$mame
Known issues:

- To start a 1 player game, press Swing or Bunt. To start a 2 players game press
either Pitch button. In a 2 players game, the players exchange at the two
couples of buttons.

- To play, you have to press the two buttons alternatively
$end

$info=cyberball
$mame
Bugs:

- The ship that is used to beam up players destroyed by the ball still seems a little bit off-centered, cyberbal236b6gre, Sports Dude



$end

$info=defendg
$mame
Bugs:

- Hard-coded "cheat" to use left/right keys instead of thrust/reverse only works for original defender, not clones, defendg36b8gre, Hein/Bugfinder



$end

$info=destderb
$mame
Known issues:

- Players 2-4 aren't fully supported

- Due to missing ROMs from the Turbo Cheap Squeak board, sound doesn't work.



$end

$info=devilw
$mame
Bugs:

- The sprites are messed up (player), devilw36b10yel, Alex



$end

$info=ddragon,ddragonb
$mame
Known issues:

- Due to the lack of the ROM image for the HD63701 microcontroller, the
  original version doesn't work. Use the bootleg instead.

- The ADPCM samples are not triggered correctly.

Bugs:

- The snare and bass drums in the music dissapear when the little hand appears on the screen to tell you to move along. The drums don't come back after this happens, ddragonb36b12gre, Foxster 



$end

$info=digdugat
$mame
Bugs:

- Two clones, digdugat and dzigzag, are unplayable; Mame halts with "Error in RomModule definition". Digdugat36b15red, Frotz



$end

$info=dkingjr
$mame
Bugs:

- Some sounds are missing, like for jumping, falling, and when DK rattles his cage, dkongjr36b10gre, nmgara



$end

$info=dino
$mame
Bugs:

- Need 16 bit color. Color problem when there is a lot of sprite on screen (like in the later stage (elevator section)), dino136b12gre, YMI,  Player 3 got no start button, dino236b12gre, YMI, In '3 PLAYERS 3 COIN CHUTE' mode (dip switch option: 'system configuration'->'Play mode') 'COIN C' give credit to all players: It should give credit only to Player 3,  dino336b12gre, YMI 

- In the level where the dino's foot tries to step on you, pieces of the 'foot' disappear when there are 3+ enemies on the screen. dino36b13gre, MC68K



$end

$info=dkong
$mame
Bugs:

- Startup sound is wrong (should be Mario's jump sound). When Mario runs, the sound of his footsteps should change slightly in pitch (high, medium, low, high, medium, low, high, low, repeat). This is checked against my DK board. This is the DK startup sequence: When the board is powered on, there is garbage in video ram, which is displayed upside down, mario's jump sound is heard, then the title screen (everything is right-side up now). If the board is reset during a game, the last thing in video ram is shown upside down, then mario's jump sound, then the normal title screen. (these bugs have been there for a very long time). dkong36b15gre, MC68K



$end

$info=domino
$mame

- lvl 6, from time to time there's a shadow appearing on the border on the screen, but no water comes out from those? dspirit36b5gre 

 - the game freezes middle of level 6 (impossible to finish the game)ÿ dspirit361b5red  Ashura

$end

$info=elecyoyo
$mame
Known issues:

- Keep F2 pressed to enter test mode, then F1 to advance to the next test.There are no dip switches, press F1 to enter the service mode, then  F1      Next screen  F2      Next line  F5      Up  F6      DownThe first time you run the game, it will ask the language. You can use F1 to proceed through all the configuration screens, or just reset (F3).To change the language afterwards, delete the ELECYOYO.HI file from the HIdirectory and re-run the program. 



$end

$info=elevator,elevatob
$mame
Known issues:

- Since it doesn't have to emulate the 68705, the bootleg is faster than the
  original. Also, emulation of the 68705 protection is still not 100%. If you
  see an 8 at the bottom of the screen, or the game resets, it's caused by n
\ There is a click sound constantly playing in the game, and it wasn't there before (for information I have a SB live) dspirit236b7greAshura



$end

$info=endurobl,endurob2
$mame
Bugs:

$end

$info=exerion,exeriont,exerionb
$mame
Known issues:

- exeriont resets when you try to start a game

- Sometimes the game resets while you are playing. It has been reported that
  the original did it as well, but this is still uncertain.

- The background graphics are missing.

Bugs:

- Every now and then, when the player looses a life, the emulated machine seems to reset: It aborts the game although there are one or two lives left, returns to the title screen without displaying "game over" and clears the hiscore. This happens in both non-bootleg sets. exerion36b15red, Frotz



$end

$info=exprraid,wexpress,wexpresb
$mame
Known issues:

$end

$info=f1dream,f1dreamb
$mame
Known issues:

- There's a sort of invisible wall in the last straight of the fourth circuit. On startup, the background screen of the track is colored strangely. When you reset, and the same background screen appears, the colors are correct.ÿÿf1dream36b6gre Sports Dude



$end

$info=f1gpstar
$mame
Bugs:

- Sometimes, your car flips over short walls on the course, following which you can drive through the walls to get back on course. It could be actual behavior, but having played this game in an arcade, and having crashed a lot in the arcade, I don't recall being able to do this. f1gpstar36b11gre, Sports Dude



$end

$info=fatfury 
$mame
Bugs:

- After the game over screen, the bass-whoosh sound doesn't whoosh, it just hangs on the same note, fatfury36b1gre, MC68K 


$end

$info=fax

$end

$info=fbfrenzy
$mame
Bugs:

- I have noticed that if you play the computer. The computer will pick its plays and hike the ball but 90% of the time it will just stand there until it gets hit. You can keep your players away from him for 1 quarter and he will just stand there. This does not happen in the arcade or in Neo RageX. fbfrenzy36b11gre, Foxster



$end

$info=fhawk
$mame
Bugs:

- Fighting Hawk has a major slow down. The game shows 100% play rate but acts about 50%. have tried different frame rates including auto but still slow with no change. Fhawk36b10yel, Renegade

$end

$info=galaga3
$mame
Bugs:

- the high score list is scrambled when displayed. Though I am not sure, I don't recall this ever happening before. I tried it with the mame 0.35 for win '95, and it did NOT produce he same error, galaga3rc2gre, YMI 



$end

$info=galaga3a
$mame
Bugs:

- The problem with Galaga3 (and has now shifted over to galaga3a) was that high score table was scrambled. You can still put in a anme, but as a whole, the thing looks like gibberish. It has the same look regardless of when you see it, before playing after playing, and anfter entering in name. galaga3a36b13gre, nmgara

$mame
Bugs:

- Graphics have a tendency to shift slowly to the right (no effect to the player) even with raster effects on. (With them off, it's more severe) turfmast36b7gre Sports Dude

$mame
Bugs:

- Colission Detection not perfect:- cant take big items from left or right, only from up/down- sometimes you can't kick a guy lying on the ground (player kicks in the air)- some players are not behind an object (like first punk in level 2), going down/up a lift lets screen shrink (left/right black brackets), Player screen pics missing, vendetta36b5yel, Players are not correctly behind objects (e.g.: first punk on level 2 is infront of the fence instead of behind)vendetta36b6gre, Going down/up a lift lets screen shrink (left/right black brackets)vendetta136b6gre, Players onÿ start-screen (pics) missingvendetta236b6greAlex

$info=wardner
$mame
Bugs:

- There appears to be a synth problem with Wardner in beta 11. The sound is largely corrupted, especially sounds such as when you pick up a treasure chest, shot power ball (small), or money bag, as well as when the girl is turned into a crystal ball. It also sounds as though there's a slight problem with sustain, too, with some of the sounds going on longer than normal (the credit beep, and the 'speech' at the start). Music sounds OK, it's just effects. wardner36b12gre Frotz

Known issues:

- Some garbled graphics probably due to a bad ROM.

- Collision detection is not emulated properly.

Bugs:

- Still some glitches with the finish screen- minor grafics glitches in lower right corner (maybe in left corner-it is blank) Also, the text remains the same throughout the game- whatever the text in the box is after you defeat your first opponent- it will repeat that the entire game.

Bugs:

$info=wow
$mame
Known issues:

- The original machine had a special joystick which could be moved either partially or fully in a direction. Pushing it slightly would turn around the player without making it move. The emulator assumes that you are always pushing the joystick fully, to simulate the "half press" you can press Alt.

$mame
Known issues:

- No ADPCM samples.

- The second YM2203 starts outputting static after a few seconds. This is in the original version, the bootleg doesn't have a second YM2203.

Bugs:

- music and sound effects have higher pitch than MAME 0.34 final - and for me, that was the correct pitch. wc9036b11gre, Bugfinder

- wc90b has video problems - check the snapshots, some players are cut at left and bottom of the screen - this has always been this way, could it be a bad programmed bootleg? wc90b36b11gre, Bugfinder

Known issues:

- Sometimes explosion sprites appear at the top of the screen, xevious36b6gre  MC68K 

- reports a RAM error after a reset. The first time Xevious is reset, it reports the error "RAM A". If you reset it again a few times this becomes "RAM 9" and eventually progesses to "RAM 8" and "RAM 7" and finally a reset will succeed. The next reset after that once again causes"RAM A" and the above situation repeats. xevious36b12yel Gamester
